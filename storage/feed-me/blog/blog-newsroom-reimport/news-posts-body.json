      "Title": "Developing Principles for Racial Equity in Grantmaking",
      "Field2": "\n\n<p>When Barr committed to deepening its focus on racial equity, we made a point of emphasizing the critical need to go beyond public statements to <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/actions-words\">focus on action and long-term commitment</a>: what are we actually <em>doing</em> to make a difference on racial equity? How are we changing or refocusing how we work? </p>\n<p>Since that time we have been sharing updates on what we have been learning and doing, including the <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/to-advance-racial-equity-foundation-boards-need-to-take-an-active-role\">importance of board leadership</a>, the work of staff teams to evolve our organizational policies and practices such as <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/how-we-re-reshaping-our-employee-reviews-to-be-more-equitable\">our employee review process</a> (with an upcoming blog post on another set of policies), and how our <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/racial-equity-and-barr-s-climate-program\">Climate</a> and <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/racial-equity-and-barr-s-arts-creativity-program\">Arts</a> teams are striving to understand and address racial equity in their strategies (with more to come from our Education team). </p>\n<p>It has been important for our program teams to explore racial equity in the specific context of their fields and program goals. But we’ve also felt there would be value to outlining a set of principles that both reflect and guide our program teams across the foundation. We have now drafted an initial set of principles to inform both what we do and how we work, and we wanted to share these high-level principles in the spirit of transparency and the hope of contributing to our collective work on racial equity.   </p>\n<h3>What We Do – Our Program Strategies</h3>\n<p>Barr’s Arts &amp; Creativity, Climate, and Education programs remain committed to their respective goals: <em>to elevate the arts, advance solutions for climate change, and connect all students to success in high school and beyond.</em> However, each of our programs has been re-examining its strategies and initiatives with an eagerness to understand and explore new ways of advancing these goals:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Seek to support systemic and long-term change,</strong> not just new programs and projects – examining and striving to understand root causes of racial inequity in our fields of work.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Invest in power building,</strong> with a focus on the long-term capacity and leadership of BIPOC communities, equity-centered organizations, and ecosystems. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Attend to the infrastructure and capacity of grantee organizations,</strong> including administration and infrastructure for healthy organizations and staff.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<h3>How We Work – Our Approach</h3>\n<p>We are collectively also reflecting on the ways we work – who we partner with; how we engage, partner, and communicate; and what we value, support, and measure – in order to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Center communities most affected by racism and inequality</strong></p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Prioritize trust and relationships</strong> </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Be transparent and accountable to grantees and the public</strong></p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Provide leadership with humility</strong></p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>We are discussing examples of what these principles mean concretely in our work, to build our shared understanding and advance our practice, and we intend to use them to help guide how we design, implement, assess, learn from, and evolve our grantmaking.  </p>\n<p>In sharing this current draft, we also want to be clear about a few points about how we view these principles overall. This is a working draft that we expect to update as we work and learn. The principles are aspirational, reflecting what we are striving toward, not a claim that we are making progress on all of these goals now or even know right now the best ways to do so. How the principles are applied will vary based on each program area due to the significant variations in many dimensions across the fields in which we work. And we understand the limits to our influence, with systems and structures of inequity that are deep-seated, complex, and interconnected.  </p>\n<p>It’s also important to reiterate the nature of this work as a journey, as others have often articulated, with tensions inherent in any path we pursue. We will continue to explore questions, for instance, about how to ensure that we are setting ambitious-enough goals while acknowledging that it will take considerable time and work to change practice and behavior in concrete and enduring ways. Similarly, we will be navigating the balance between some measure of consistency and accountability across Barr’s programs on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the flexibility for teams to understand and implement the principles in varied ways, appropriate to the specific context of their work. We are striving to create an environment where staff can raise, discuss, and work through these kinds of questions.</p>\n<p>We have much fertile ground for learning – and, importantly, we do not seek to learn in isolation. Aligned with these principles, we are eager to learn from and with our grantees and partners as well as others seeking to advance racial equity more broadly. </p>\n<p>We look forward to sharing our reflections and lessons as we proceed, and welcome your insights and guidance.</p>\n"

      "Title": "A Word of Thanks to a Gifted Leader",
      "Field2": "\n\n<p>This is a season of transition at the Barr Foundation. In mid-May we welcome a new president and trustee. But, before we do, Amos and I wanted to extend our heartfelt gratitude to a gifted leader, Melinda Marble, whose steady hand has ably guided Barr through this time of change and who has, for many years, been a valued colleague and trusted advisor to us both.</p>\n<p>Melinda first joined the Barr Foundation as deputy director in 2009, and we have been fortunate to have her as Barr’s interim executive director during the past year. Not content to maintain the status quo until a new leader took the reins, Melinda has strengthened the work of the foundation in vital ways—including a thorough retooling of Barr’s grantmaking process to make it more user-friendly and accessible. To this task, Melinda brought her deep respect for Barr’s partners and her unwavering commitment to building strong, effective relationships. Barr is a stronger organization today as a result of Melinda’s leadership this past year.</p>\n<p>During her tenure as deputy director, Melinda oversaw several important shifts in Barr’s funding strategies, including the decision to focus our environment program on climate change, to increase both staffing and resources in support of the arts, and to work collaboratively with the Boston Public Schools to close the opportunity gap. Her abiding commitment to Boston manifested itself in both the development of a “New Common” funding portfolio aimed at engaging new voices in the city’s policy debates and her active engagement in Boston’s successful Promise Neighborhood program application to the federal government.</p>\n<p>But Melinda’s imprint on Barr has a deeper history. A mere fifteen years ago, before we hired Barr’s first executive director, the Barr Foundation was little more than an idea, as the two of us worked with some advisors to articulate a vision and set of values we hoped would guide the Foundation’s work. To get beyond that nascent stage, we knew we needed clear thinking and strategic counsel. And so we reached out to Melinda, whose leadership of the Paul and Phyllis Fireman Foundation we greatly admired. She delivered then and has continued to do so in the intervening years.</p>\n<p>Even before Melinda joined our staff in 2009, she served on the Barr Fellows selection committee—helping select four cohorts of talented Boston nonprofit leaders. As deputy director, Melinda oversaw all of Barr’s grantmaking during a period of growth and change. She was also an insightful member of our search committee for Barr’s new president. In innumerable ways, Melinda has been an asset to our philanthropic efforts, and we could not be more grateful to her.</p>\n<p>While this transition marks Melinda’s formal departure from the Barr Foundation, Amos and I are personally delighted that she will remain closely engaged with us as the first Director of Family Philanthropy for Pilot House Associates. In this new role, in addition to supporting our continued philanthropic efforts, she will be a partner in planning ways to support the philanthropy of future generations of our family.</p>\n<p>We are grateful to Melinda for the many ways she has enhanced our work at Barr over the years and now look forward to this new partnership. Please join us in thanking Melinda.</p>\n<p>Barbara Hostetter<br/>\nChairman, Board of Trustees</p>\n"

      "Title": "Barr Expands its Office Space",
      "Field2": "\n\n<p>About two years ago, Barr staff began to outgrow the Foundation’s longtime office space in our historic home, <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/about#our-office\">The Pilot House</a>. As recent visitors to our space know, staff have been split among floors while we explored long-term solutions.</p>\n<p>We were very fortunate to be able to expand into the fourth floor of the adjoining building at Two Atlantic Avenue. This solution offered enough space to unite our staff on a single floor, as well as the opportunity to think about how our office space could better support the work we carry out with our partners.</p>\n<p>When designing the space, we sought to create a warm and welcoming environment for our visitors. We also wanted flexible space, able to accommodate our growing staff (three new colleagues will join us over the next few months) and various partner convenings.</p>\n<p>After months of planning, Barr staff moved in last week. The new conference facilities have modular furniture and movable walls, so that we can adjust the space based on the specific needs of our guests. While at The Pilot House, we happily opened up our main convening space as much as possible to our grantees for their meetings and events. We plan to extend that invitation for our new space, as well, after renovations are fully complete by early next year. </p>\n<p>We are currently renovating the Pilot House side of the floor, aiming to preserve the historic characteristics of the building that we all love, including its exposed brick, vaulted entryways, and arched windows that inspired the “BF” in our Barr Foundation logo. We are also modernizing the space in the same spirit of openness, flexibility, and hospitality. By early 2017, we expect to occupy the full length of the fourth floor in Two Atlantic and The Pilot House.</p>\n<p>As we continue this period of evolution for Barr, within our program areas and internally, we are excited about how our new space can contribute to working in collaboration with our many partners to advance our shared priorities.</p>\n"

      "Title": "We Must Persevere",
      "Field2": "\n\n<p>It’s exhausting, isn’t it? </p>\n<p>Another outrageous outburst from the highest office in our land. </p>\n<p>This time, it was a racist, personal attack against our fellow Americans. And not just any Americans, but four members of Congress democratically elected by the people in their districts to represent them. </p>\n<p>I have wondered what, if anything, to say. </p>\n<p>After Charlottesville, I was horrified by the violence and white nationalism, and the suggestion that “both sides” were to blame. </p>\n<p>I wondered, “Is it important for the Barr Foundation to lend its voice in response?” </p>\n<p>Then, I recalled Martin Luther King’s exhortation: “In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.” I didn’t want us to be counted among the silent. So, I wrote, <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/we-must-all-speak-out\">“We Must All Speak Out,”</a> encouraging all of us to use our voices and whatever platforms we have to affirm our values, and to condemn violence and hatred.</p>\n<p>After the massacre at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, I wondered again whether a public response would make any difference. </p>\n<p>Then, I joined with hundreds of others from throughout Greater Boston, as they gathered in the Boston Common. Inspired by that experience of solidarity and community I wrote, <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/we-all-must-stand-up\">“We Must Stand Up.”</a> </p>\n<p>There are surely countless other incidents during the past few years that I might have written about too. Yet, as the reasons for outrage have grown so many and so unrelenting, I have found it increasingly difficult not to feel discouraged, worn down, even numb. I know my colleagues feel the same.</p>\n<p>So, in the face of the latest outrage, I ask myself again what difference one more voice can possibly make.</p>\n<p>In writing now, I have no new course of action from Barr to announce, no new grantmaking program to launch, and no panaceas to put forward.</p>\n<p>But what I do have is the inspiration of those leaders who are stepping up to this moment, confronting the vitriol and hatred head on, supporting those who are being targeted and marginalized, and showing all of us the importance of showing up, speaking out, and stepping up.</p>\n<p>As Sean Gibbons from the Communications Network <a href=\"https://www.comnetwork.org/resources/silence-speaks-volumes/\">wrote earlier this week</a>: “what might it look like if, over the next few weeks, every nonprofit or foundation did a simple, decent thing and used their institutional voice to clearly and publicly affirm their core values, purpose, and aspirations? Silence speaks volumes. <em>And words matter.</em> They can harm. Or they can help, heal, and keep hope alive.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"Pullquote\"> We must boldly proclaim the values that unite us, drive us, and bind us to our work of higher mission and purpose. <a class=\"Pullquote-cta\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet/?dnt=true&amp;text=We+must+boldly+proclaim+the+values+that+unite+us%2C+drive+us%2C+and+bind+us+to+our+work+of+higher+mission+and+purpose.+%40jcanales+on+recommitting+to+our+values+and+work+in+today%27s+political+climate.\"> <svg class=\"Icon\" height=\"48\" viewbox=\"628 -718 2048 2048\" width=\"48\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"> <path d=\"M2417.2-86.6c1.2,17,1.2,33.9,1.2,50.9c0,517.3-393.8,1113.4-1113.4,1113.4c-221.7,0-427.7-64.2-601-175.7 c31.5,3.6,61.8,4.8,94.5,4.8c183,0,351.4-61.8,485.8-167.2c-172-3.6-316.2-116.3-365.9-271.4c24.2,3.6,48.5,6.1,73.9,6.1 c35.1,0,70.3-4.8,103-13.3C916.1,424.7,781.6,267.2,781.6,76.9c0-1.2,0-3.6,0-4.8c52.1,29.1,112.7,47.2,176.9,49.7 C853.1,51.5,784-68.4,784-204.2c0-72.7,19.4-139.3,53.3-197.5C1030-164.2,1319.6-9.1,1644.3,7.9c-6.1-29.1-9.7-59.4-9.7-89.7 c0-215.7,174.5-391.3,391.3-391.3c112.7,0,214.4,47.2,285.9,123.6c88.4-17,173.3-49.7,248.4-94.5c-29.1,90.9-90.9,167.2-172,215.7 c78.7-8.5,155.1-30.3,225.3-60.6C2560.2-211.4,2493.6-142.4,2417.2-86.6z\"></path> </svg> Tweet This </a> </blockquote>\n<p>This latest outrage was sparked by words with clear intent to demean, to divide, and to distract. As our own Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley noted: “This is a disruptive distraction from the issues of care, concern and consequence to the American people.” Now is the time to refocus our efforts on that very work. We must boldly proclaim the values that unite us, drive us, and bind us to our work of higher mission and purpose. </p>\n<p>As exhausting and dispiriting as it is to find ourselves at such a moment again, we must persevere.

      "Title": "Barr Foundation Announces $28.5 Million in New Grants",
      "Field2": "\n\n<p>At its meeting on December 7, the Barr Foundation’s Board of Trustees approved a final set of grants for 2016, as the Foundation concluded its first year of implementing new strategic directions. In all, Barr awarded $73.5 million in grants during 2016, which represents the largest-ever annual authorization in the Foundation’s history. Jim Canales will share more in a blog post next week, including a preview of plans for 2017.</p>\n<p>At this time, we invite you to explore all grants awarded this quarter through <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/grantmaking/grants\">our online grants database</a> and to learn more about our partners. Below we highlight several new and continuing efforts aligned with Barr’s <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/grantmaking/our-strategies\">strategic priorities</a> announced earlier this year.</p>\n<p>In <strong>Arts &amp; Creativity</strong>, Barr awarded 14 grants totaling $7.6 million. Two new partnerships will help integrate the arts into community planning and development. A $1,525,000 grant to the <a href=\"http://www.mapc.org\">Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC)</a> will support a comprehensive initiative to advance the arts as a core element of municipal planning through education and training, project funding, and other tools, as well as policy work. These resources will help meet demand from cities across the state for cultural planning and development strategies. A $1.1-million grant to the <a href=\"http://www.worcestermass.org/worcester-cultural-coalition\">Worcester Cultural Coalition</a> will help bring such strategies to fruition by supporting the fit-out and operations of the WOOteria, a new collaborative art space and 300-seat black box theater in the downtown district.</p>\n<p>In <strong>Climate</strong>, Barr awarded 20 grants totaling $12 million. Grants of $1.2 million to both <a href=\"http://acadiacenter.org\">Acadia Center</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.clf.org\">Conservation Law Foundation</a> will support clean energy policy analysis and development in New England, and grants to the <a href=\"http://www.betterfutureproject.org\">Better Future Project</a>, <a href=\"http://www.environmentamericacenter.org\">Environment America Research &amp; Policy Center</a>, and <a href=\"https://noharm.org\">Health Care Without Harm</a> will help a variety of groups working to expand clean energy throughout the region to increase their leadership and grassroots organizing capacity. As Barr looks to support smart, walkable communities statewide, a $455,000 grant to <a href=\"http://massinc.org\">The Massachusetts Institute for a New Commonwealth (MassINC)</a> will assess transit-oriented development potential in Gateway Cities, providing insight into how different development and transit scenarios would affect these cities’ economies, services, and greenhouse gas emissions. Grants to the <a href=\"https://www.boston.gov/\">City of Boston</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.umb.edu/ssl\">UMass Boston Sustainable Solutions Lab</a> will support neighborhood-level resilience projects, coastal protection analyses, and community engagement as part of Phase II of <a href=\"http://climateready.boston.gov\">Climate Ready Boston</a>.</p>\n<p>In <strong>Education</strong>, Barr awarded 15 grants totaling nearly $3.6 million. Many of these support a growing spectrum of innovative school models and programs in the region designed to increase success in high school and beyond, especially for the most underserved students. A renewed grant of $300,000 to <a href=\"http://rocainc.org\">Roca</a> will expand its intervention model for high-risk young men in Boston, as part of the Massachusetts Juvenile Justice Pay for Success Initiative. A $200,000 grant to <a href=\"http://collegebounddorchester.org\">College Bound Dorchester</a> will support an external evaluation of its college access and success model for at-risk youth, which will inform the organization’s program improvement and related efforts in the field.</p>\n<p>In <strong>Cross-Program Initiatives</strong>, Barr awarded four grants totaling $600,000. A $450,000 grant to the <a href=\"http://massnonprofitnet.org\">Massachusetts Nonprofit Network (MNN)</a> will provide core support to help MNN continue to serve as a key advocate and leadership voice for the state’s nonprofit sector. A $100,000 grant to the <a href=\"http://www.socialinnovationforum.org\">Social Innovation Forum (SIF)</a> will help SIF strengthen its marketplace approach to social impact in Greater Boston, connecting social-purpose organizations with a community of supporters and skilled volunteers.</p>\n<p>Barr also awarded more than $1.5 million to advance advocacy and open space as part of <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/stewarding-a-boston-treasure\">a special initiative</a> to realize a great public realm throughout Boston’s waterfront, as well as one-time grants to support the design, construction, and maintenance of <a href=\"http://www.teammr8.org/martins-park-childrens-wharf\">Martin’s Park</a> on the Fort Point Channel, in memory of Martin Richard, who lost his life in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing.</p>\n<p>As we conclude 2016 and look to the future, we keep in mind what a privilege it is to support and work with these and so many other outstanding partners throughout the region.

      "Title": "A Milestone Year",
      "Field2": "\n\n<p>Beginning with <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/grantmaking/our-strategies\">new strategic directions</a> and concluding—<a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/barr-foundation-announces-28-5-million-in-new-grants\">as announced last week</a>—with the largest authorization of grants ($73.5 million) in our history, 2016 has been a milestone year for the Barr Foundation. </p>\n<p>At our last board meeting of 2016, Barr staff and trustees reflected together on progress, challenges, and priorities for the year ahead. I am pleased to share just a few of the highlights of progress this year, with gratitude to a great set of partners:</p>\n<h4>Arts and Artists Engaging Community</h4>\n<p>In our Arts &amp; Creativity program, we supported several initiatives focused on the role of artists as community leaders with the aim of deepening public engagement. In Boston, support to ArtsEmerson sponsored artist residencies that engaged the larger community, and a partnership with the City of Boston embedded artists in city departments and agencies through the Artist-in-Residence program. Barr also supported the <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/partners/boston-creates-between-the-lines\">active engagement of artists in Boston Creates</a>, a city-wide cultural planning process. Throughout Greater Boston, the new <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/creative-city-artists-are-activating-their-communities\">“Creative City”</a> partnership with the New England Foundation for the Arts funded artists to integrate public participation into their artistic process or presentation.</p>\n<h4>New Policies, Practices, and Plans to Prepare for a Changing Climate</h4>\n<p>Through our Climate program, several of our partners played vital roles in the enactment of new public policies in Massachusetts that will accelerate deployment of renewable energy, increase jobs in the clean energy sector, and further drive down greenhouse gas emissions. Also contributing to emissions reductions are smarter efforts in Massachusetts cities and towns to enhance mobility and livability, such as redesigned streets, new bike lanes, and improved public transit. Finally, just last week, the City of Boston released <a href=\"https://www.boston.gov/environment-and-energy/climate-ready-boston\">Climate Ready Boston</a>, a comprehensive study and blueprint to ensure that Boston is fully prepared for the ongoing impacts of climate change. All of this work continues to position the Commonwealth as a leader in climate action.</p>\n<h4>Connecting Students to Success in High School and Beyond</h4>\n<p>In Education, out of our <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/new-strategies-for-barr-s-education-program\">new strategies</a>, we launched a first major, multi-year initiative focused on supporting high-quality, student-centered schools and programs explicitly designed to serve students who are currently off track to graduate from high school. We have been heartened by the tremendous interest across New England, and we look forward to the responses to our recently-issued <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/education/rfp\">request for proposals</a>. We will award our initial grants in this initiative in 2017, and are excited to be expanding options for students underserved by our current educational system.</p>\n<h4>Taking the Long-Term View of Boston’s Waterfront</h4>\n<p>This year, we also launched a new Special Initiative focused on <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2016/09/29/what-vision-for-boston-waterfront/rJgp6aUoNzzGVnJiqMqrjM/story.html\">creating a great public realm throughout Boston’s waterfront</a>, with the goal of ensuring that we protect and steward this treasure for generations to come. In 2016, we supported planning work by multiple public and nonprofit partners who share this ambitious goal, and we are setting the stage for additional investment in 2017 and beyond. I will have more to report on this signature initiative in January.</p>\n<p>These are just a few highlights in what was a full and productive year, enabled by the inspiring and committed leaders we are privileged to support. Yet, we know there is much more to do on all of these fronts. And we enter 2017 even more resolute in Barr’s mission to invest in potential, serving as stewards and catalysts. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"Pullquote\"> <p>We know there is much more to do on all of these fronts.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Toward that end, at our board meeting last week, Barr’s trustees approved a grants budget of $80 million for 2017, a 9% increase from 2016. This represents our commitment to build on the progress of 2016, and it acknowledges a different context for our work. </p>\n<p>As many have noted in recent weeks, we are entering a period of change and uncertainty for many of the issues at the core of the Foundation’s work.  Yet, amidst this changing context, what emerges with clarity is the imperative of a vital and robust nonprofit community to uphold and protect the values of a civil society, among them an abiding respect for diverse people and perspectives, and commitment to open, informed discourse. </p>\n<p>All of the issues we focus on at Barr—whether connecting more students to success, advancing climate solutions, or elevating the arts and creativity—depend on these values flourishing. And as our partners adjust to new realities, we realize we too must stay flexible and nimble, even examining how our own core assumptions and strategies must evolve to be most effective.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"Pullquote\"> <p>We remain committed to elevating the values we hold dear as a civil society.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>In all that we do, we remain committed to elevating the values we hold dear as a civil society. Indeed, this may be more critical than ever before, both to continue forward progress on the challenges before us and to ensure all people can share in that progress. With confidence in our collective determination to step up to these challenges, we stand ready to be partners in this vital work.</p>\n"

      "Title": "Ten Questions with Barr’s New Vice President",
      "Field2": "\n\n<h4>How do you describe what you’re here to do?</h4>\n<p>My goal is to help create an environment for Barr staff and partners to do great work and have deep impact. That means working in close partnership with Foundation leadership, program teams, and Barr’s operations teams—both to build on Barr’s history and support its exciting new strategies, and to make sure we’re always listening, learning, and improving. </p>\n<h4>How have you spent these first few weeks?</h4>\n<p>I’ve been getting to know the staff, the culture and values of the Foundation, and how it operates. I’ve also started meeting with some of our grantees and other partners in the region to get a sense of the broader context of our work.  </p>\n<h4>What has stood out to you from these conversations?</h4>\n<p>One thing that stood out to me was a focus on impact. On the Barr team, there is a seriousness with which staff take their work and approach the issue areas we are engaged in. This was particularly evident as they walked me through the thinking that went into the new program strategies. Grantees and partners I’ve talked with have also been very clear about the challenges we face and the urgency of our shared work. Across the board, staff and grantees are eager to learn from what we are doing and continuously improve our efforts in pursuit of the greatest impact.  </p>\n<p>I was also struck by the theme of gratitude among Barr staff. That gratitude is connected to a deep respect for and sense of responsibility to Barr’s trustees and to the organizations with whom we have the privilege of working.</p>\n<h4>What’s at the top of your priority list for the next six to 12 months?</h4>\n<p>In this first year, I plan to concentrate on three major priorities. First is to fully understand our strategies and the work of our partners, so that I can help support and accelerate our shared efforts. My second priority is to build an approach for learning and evaluation that pulls best practices from the field and aligns with the Foundation’s values. Third is to further shape Barr’s approach to investing in leaders—one of the Cross-Program Initiatives priorities <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/introducing-cross-program-initiatives\">Jim Canales introduced in March</a>. </p>\n<h4>How do you see the role of learning and evaluation at Barr?</h4>\n<p>Barr is very much a learning organization already. People here are clearly eager to learn and to find the ideas that have the most impact and get us where we want to go. I’m excited to enter into a context with a dual emphasis on learning and evaluation, to be clear that we see evaluation as a tool not merely for due diligence, but for learning, improving, and increasing our impact: more effectively supporting grantees; strengthening our strategies; and sharing lessons with the field.</p>\n<h4>What do you think makes for strong leaders?</h4>\n<p>Constantly learning and pushing for change is at the center of everything strong leaders do. Leaders are developed in environments that foster intellectual curiosity.  That is one of the lasting lessons I take from my time working with GE. I have never been at a place that thought so carefully and comprehensively about leadership development, both at an individual and organization level.     </p>\n<h4>You’re joining Barr at a time of great turmoil in our country. Do you see a role for philanthropy in addressing this?</h4>\n<p>One of the things I often said to my students at Brown was that leadership on our critical social issues requires a paradoxical sense of urgency along with a long-term view. In many ways, the challenges we are facing now are the same ones we have faced in this country for hundreds of years. We absolutely need a sense of urgency to take action today. But we also need to consider the history that has brought us to this point, in order to address the very deep roots underlying these challenges. </p>\n<h4>Your career has spanned a number of sectors, including nonprofit, corporate, and government. How have these different vantage points shaped your approach to this work?</h4>\n<p>One of my goals for working across sectors was to help me understand how change happens broadly in the world and what change levers are available for each of those sectors. For change to happen, we really need all sectors engaged and aligned, bringing their respective leadership, perspective, and resources. Fostering substantive change requires us to connect programs, policy, advocacy, research, and innovation around a shared vision. I’ve found that philanthropy can influence these various levers for change in different ways, but is often most effective when it reaches across sectors to bring groups together under a shared goal. </p>\n<h4>Have you seen instances where philanthropy is unhelpful?</h4>\n<p>Philanthropy is unhelpful when it thinks it has the best idea in the room. Consciously or unconsciously, that kind of thinking can be easy to fall into—it’s one of the occupational hazards of our sector and its power dynamics. Keeping strong connections with the communities and grantees we serve is, in my view, the best way to stay grounded, and to avoid that kind of arrogance.</p>\n<h4>Now that you’re not commuting to Washington, D.C., for work, what are you most excited to do with your time?</h4>\n<p>Now that I’m living back home in New England full time, I’m excited to have more time with my family (my wife, two sons, and daughter) and getting reacquainted with them after two years in D.C. I’m also looking forward to exploring neighborhoods and regions in New England and getting to know the abundance of arts and cultural institutions here, which was one of the things I really loved about living in D.C.</p>\n"

      "Title": "Learning and Evaluation for Greater Impact",
      "Field2": "\n\n<p>Since <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/ten-questions-with-barr-s-new-vice-president\">I arrived at Barr in July</a>, one of my top priorities has been to advance the Foundation’s approach to learning and evaluation: how we gauge the impact we’re having and apply and share the lessons we’re learning. I am pleased to be able to share key insights and decisions that emerged from our months-long inquiry.</p>\n<p>Over the past six months, we drew on the generous insights of grantees and partners, input from colleagues and experts nationally, and findings from benchmarking efforts (such as the timely release last fall of <a href=\"http://effectivephilanthropy.org/breaking-down-the-data-on-evaluation\">a new report on evaluation practices</a> from The Center for Effective Philanthropy). This research helped us understand current practices, opportunities, and needs, and to reflect, with our trustees, on the best path for Barr.  </p>\n<p>From these conversations, we have framed a set of goals, principles, and next steps. </p>\n<p>Our overall goal for evaluation and learning is to maximize the impact of the Foundation’s resources over time. We will pursue this goal in two ways:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Investing selectively in evaluations</strong> at the grant, Foundation, and field levels to assess impact and identify the elements that led to impact.</li>\n<li><strong>Developing and supporting structures and opportunities for learning</strong> at the Foundation and in the field.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will also make targeted investments in capacity building, where we and our partners identify particular needs and opportunities.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"Pullquote\"> <p>Our overall goal for evaluation and learning is to maximize the impact of the Foundation’s resources over time.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Three guiding principles will shape all of our evaluation and learning efforts—that they be meaningful, actionable, and manageable:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Meaningful</strong>:  By “meaningful,” we mean that evaluations will be designed to produce credible information on big questions that advance understanding in our fields in significant ways, and to explore both successes and failures.</li>\n<li><strong>Actionable</strong>:  We will focus on questions and information that can be applied directly to increase the impact of an intervention or strategy.</li>\n<li><strong>Manageable</strong>:  Our activities will be structured to maximize learning while minimizing burden on our partners (or staff); i.e., they will focus on a limited number of clearly-defined questions, and utilize methods appropriate for the work being evaluated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One immediate, significant investment will be to build our staff capacity and knowledge by hiring a director of learning and evaluation.  This person will work with Foundation leadership and staff to continue sharpening our overall approach, and with program teams to refine and implement clear goals, learning questions, metrics, learning opportunities, and targeted evaluations.  We invite you to review the <a href=\"https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/118/attachments/Barr_Foundation_Director_of_Learning_and_Evaluation_2017_Final.pdf?1485268070\">job description</a> and to help us identify strong candidates for this important role.  </p>\n<p>Investments in learning and evaluation flow directly from <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/about#core-values\">Barr’s core values</a> and from the ways we approach all of our work—in particular, with commitments to share knowledge and learning, and to demonstrate openness and transparency. We acknowledge we have much to learn, and we are excited to take these next steps in partnership with many this year.</p>\n"

      "Title": "Six Questions with Barr's New Vice President for Administration",
      "Field2": "\n\n<h3>What's it like to start a new job in the middle of a pandemic?</h3>\n<p>This is one of the best onboarding experiences I've had. I interviewed virtually and have worked with most of my colleagues primarily over video conference. I give credit to the people at Barr—there's a real culture of connection here. On my first day, I did wonder what may be lost by not being in person, but my new team put any concerns at ease with a fun introduction icebreaker. That allowed me to feel comfortable to be myself and share my background. Since then, it's been a fairly smooth transition. I carved out dedicated time to meet every one of my colleagues one-on-one, which proved invaluable especially when starting a new job during a pandemic.</p>\n<h3>Tell us about the path that brought you to Barr.</h3>\n<p>My career path has not been linear, but there are some consistent themes. I love working in organizations that focus on improving the human condition and with people who bring their imagination, a sense of realistic optimism, and a focus on what's possible.</p>\n<p>I started my career in professional services as a Certified Public Accountant. I was always asking my clients questions about their business environment and wanted to know more about how their organization worked. That led me to graduate school, where I interned in several work environments. After graduate school, I worked in the entertainment industry, a stem cell agency, and a biomedical and biotech research institute. </p>\n<h3>As Vice President for Administration, you oversee technology, grants management, finance, culture, and more. What are your biggest priorities right now?</h3>\n<p>I'm focused on the people and culture. My goal is to set the conditions for others to thrive. To do that, I'm in learning mode right now. I want to understand how we do things and why. I want to support staff as we build and sustain a culture around diversity, equity, and inclusion while emphasizing our core values—especially humility. I give kudos to our leadership for putting people first.</p>\n<h3>The COVID-19 pandemic has affected nearly every facet of how organizations do their work. What have been some of the most disruptive challenges for Barr?</h3>\n<p>We've had to adapt and build new capacities around how we work and share knowledge. We're learning how to create new processes to adapt to change. These changes will help us have the most impact as we work remotely.</p>\n<p>We've taken a \"how might we\" approach and embraced learning. I want to encourage staff to take risks and experiment because, as my daughter's teacher says, \"Mistakes are magical.\"</p>\n<h3>This year, Barr has deepened its commitment to equity and inclusion, both externally and internally. What does that internal work look like?</h3>\n<p>There's a saying that \"change happens at the speed of trust.\" I think that applies to our internal DEI work. Barr has been on a years-long learning journey to apply principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion to all aspects of our work and grantmaking. So far, we have created two different Action Learning Teams, composed of staff from across the Foundation, to take a fresh look at specific policies and practices with a DEI lens. Some of the key questions were: how do our policies impact our people? Who benefits? Who is marginalized?</p>\n<p>We learned how our policies and practices could unintentionally reinforce white, dominant culture. In practice, we were far more flexible and supportive than some of our internal policies would suggest—though not all staff were aware or benefiting from that flexibility and support. So, it was an eye-opening experience to understand where this language came from and to shift in ways that benefit all of our employees. Many people on the Action Learning Teams commented that this was one of the most valuable aspects of their work at Barr. This internal process is still a work in progress, with more updates to come. But we know our organization will be stronger and more resilient because of this approach.</p>\n<h3>What is something people find surprising to learn about you?</h3>\n<p>I've always been interested in storytelling, human behavior, and development. When I worked in the movie/tv business, I was surprised to learn that many people who write for soap operas have educational backgrounds in these fields. In another life, I might have been a daytime soap opera writer! Watching these shows is a connection I share with my grandmother, mother, aunts, and uncles. For some soaps, my family members have been fans for over forty years, so maybe that's where I learned the value of the long-term view. </p>\n"

Jaime comes to Barr with a multi-faceted background, having served as a grantmaker, educator, artist, and activist in a career that spans over twenty years in the arts.</p>\n<p>At the San Francisco Foundation and as program associate at the San Francisco Arts Commission, Jaime worked extensively with both individual artist applicants and with organizations, overseeing more than 1,000 grant proposals and shepherding applicants through the process with a keen eye toward creating opportunities for professional development and capacity-building. Jaime is an artist himself and, here at Barr, we are confident that his unique perspective as a funder and artist will serve our mission to be thoughtful stewards and catalysts for change.</p>\n<p>Jaime began his work in the arts as a program manager for the venerable Latino art space Galeria de la Raza, where he curated multi-disciplinary, year-round public art exhibits and programs designed to strengthen community arts, while bringing together local, national, and international artists. His work in arts education has focused on nurturing individual artists, and he has been an arts instructor for adults, college students, and high school students at institutions that include UC Berkeley, the California Institute for Integral Studies, Berkeley High School, and Intersection for the Arts.</p>\n<div class=\"Media -small -left\"> <div class=\"Media-imageWrapper\"> <img alt=\"Jamie C headshot smallest \" class=\"Media-image\" src=\"https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/474/crop_preview.jpg?1642116852\"/> </div> </div>\n<p>Jaime has a poet’s mind, working in multiple media that span colored pencil drawings and graphic novels to light-box installations to live performance. He has published more than a dozen works of fiction and he wrote and illustrated the graphic novel <em>Sexile</em>, focused on the life story of transgender HIV activist Adela Vasquez. Jaime has also worked as an activist, using art and media as a means of education and prevention in the fight against HIV/AIDS while working with AIDS Project Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>Jaime joins Barr at an exciting moment for the arts in Boston, as we embark upon multiple cultural planning processes that aim to strengthen our individual artists and build communities anchored by strong arts organizations. Jaime’s understanding of multiple arts disciplines and his ability to select and nurture organizations that are navigating shifting arts ecosystems will prove a valuable asset.</p>\n<p>At the San Francisco Foundation, Jaime demonstrated an ability to collaborate cross-departmentally with education objectives, bringing arts education in line with the Foundation’s broader education objectives. We look forward to Jaime’s insights into this area as Barr moves forward following the recent appointment of <a href=\"/blog/a-few-words-with-barr-s-new-director-of-education\">our new director of education, Leah Hamilton</a>. Jaime’s appointment rounds out an arts team focused on strengthening leadership, advocacy, and risk-taking in the field; we are confident that his diverse experiences will be a valuable asset in continuing to build and expand a robust arts portfolio. We all look forward to welcoming him to the Barr team and introducing him personally to our partners when he joins us at the beginning of August.</p>\n"

      "Title": "Strategic Communications at Barr",
      "Field2": "\n\n<p>In <a href=\"/blog/from-the-president-july-2014\">my most recent President’s Message</a>, I noted that one of my early priorities for Barr was to explore how we could more fully leverage communications to extend the Foundation’s impact, complement our grantmaking, and amplify the work of our grantees. I want to share an update on that work here.</p>\n<p>With a planning process on the horizon for Barr in 2015, it was the right time to initiate this work for two reasons: first, I arrived at Barr with a strong conviction that communications—when strategically and selectively deployed—can help advance our mission and deepen our impact beyond what is possible by grantmaking alone. A close look at foundations that do this well reveals one common feature: they possess a communications mindset. By this I mean that, more than a set of tactics for disseminating news or ideas, strong communicating foundations bring disciplined ways of thinking about challenges and potential solutions—a discipline we will fully integrate throughout our planning next year.</p>\n<p>My second reason is that, with the encouragement and support of the trustees, the Barr Foundation is prepared to step away, even more fully than it has in recent years, from its origins as an anonymous, quietly effective institution, and to embrace communications as one of the important tools at its disposal.</p>\n<p>We will share more in the months ahead about the role of communications at Barr, but for now, I am delighted to announce the appointment of <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/stefan-lanfer\">Stefan Lanfer</a> as Barr's first director of communications, effective today. Since 2010, Stefan has ably served as Barr’s knowledge officer with a range of communications responsibilities; however, this change acknowledges the strategic leadership role communications will play in Barr’s work in the future.</p>\n<p>In addition we will soon initiate a search for a communications project manager in order to deepen our capacity to pursue a more ambitious agenda. We will post that job description here in the coming days.  </p>\n<p>Finally, in the spirit of communications being about engagement, and not just one-way transmission of information, I invite you to email me at <a href=\"mailto:president@barrfoundation.org\">president@barrfoundation.org</a> with comments, advice, and observations about this message or any other facet of Barr’s work.</p>\n<h4>Learn more about the role of communications at Barr:</h4>\n<div class=\"Media -full\"> <div class=\"u-fluid-iframe\"> <div class=\"u-fluid-iframe-inner\"> <iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" data-ready=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/406218990?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0\" title=\"Video: The Role of Communications at the Barr Foundation\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\"> <a href=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/406218990?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0\">A video on Vimeo</a> </iframe> </div> </div> </div>\n"

      "Field2": "\n\n<p>Last week, we announced the <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/new-initiative-protects-civil-liberties-and-informed-democracy\">first set of grants</a> as part of a Special Initiative in 2017 to respond to dramatic shifts in the national context, to increased polarization, and to growing concerns about equity and opportunity for vulnerable populations. Those grants focused on supporting frontline organizations working with vulnerable communities, promoting human rights, and protecting civil liberties in Massachusetts through legal protection, community education and organizing, and public awareness efforts.</p>\n<p>As a complement to this important work, Barr’s Special Initiative has as its second goal: <em>to strengthen and sustain journalism in the United States as an essential part of democracy, with a focus on investigative journalism and protections for freedom of the press.</em></p>\n<p>In today’s environment, investing in quality journalism and strengthening efforts to protect the press and defend the First Amendment is as vital as ever. A free press stands as one of the cornerstones of American democracy, and it remains essential to educating the public and holding the powerful to account. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"Pullquote\"> <p>A free press stands as one of the cornerstones of American democracy, and it remains essential to educating the public and holding the powerful to account.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>In pursuing this work, our aim was to build on the philanthropic leadership provided by many national foundations that have invested in journalism and media for many years and that include this work as a key part of their strategies. Notable examples include the Knight, MacArthur, and Ford foundations, among others. Their ongoing commitment has been essential, and we sought to build on their support in ways that were particularly responsive to the unique threats that journalism and free speech are facing at this moment.</p>\n<p>For this set of grants, we worked in close partnership with the Heising-Simons Foundation in California, which is <a href=\"https://www.heisingsimons.org/heising-simons-foundation-grants-strengthen-sustain-journalism/\">announcing today</a> its own grantmaking effort focused on journalism. This partnership sought to demonstrate how foundations can leverage each other’s knowledge, partner constructively to advance a shared agenda, and minimize the amount of work required by our shared grantees.</p>\n<p>Building on the $1 million in grants announced last week, today we are announcing another $1.43 million in grants to the following seven organizations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.revealnews.org\"><strong>Center for Investigative Reporting (CIR)</strong></a><br/>\n$300,000 to provide core support, payable over 24 months</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.cpj.org\"><strong>Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ)</strong></a><br/>\n$200,000 to provide core support for activities in the United States, payable over 24 months</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://nefirstamendment.org\"><strong>New England First Amendment Coalition</strong></a><br/>\n$45,000 to provide core support, payable over 36 months</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.northeastern.edu\"><strong>Northeastern University</strong></a><br/>\n$35,000 to conduct a research study on philanthropy and nonprofit news journalism and dissemination activities, in partnership with the <a href=\"https://shorensteincenter.org\">Shorenstein Center</a>, payable over six months</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org\"><strong>ProPublica</strong></a><br/>\n$400,000 to provide core support, payable over 36 months</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.rcfp.org\"><strong>Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (RCFP)</strong></a><br/>\n$150,000 to provide core support, payable over 36 months</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.bu.edu\"><strong>Trustees of Boston University</strong></a><br/>\n$300,000 to support a new investigative reporting unit at <a href=\"http://www.wbur.org\">WBUR</a>, payable over 36 months</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As this is a time-limited initiative, we worked closely with each organization to structure these multi-year, core support grants in ways that will not create instability in the near-term. We are especially attentive to the fact that some of these organizations are benefiting from a one-time influx of resources with some uncertainty about the continuation of that support. </p>\n<p>We also elected not to focus on media organizations working only on Barr’s focus areas. Recognizing the importance of enhancing coverage and building public understanding of these topics, we have supported such organizations in the past (and will continue to), in alignment with our core grantmaking strategies. Yet, for this one-time Special Initiative, our support is aimed more broadly at strengthening quality investigative work and protections for freedom of the press. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"Pullquote\"> <p>Our support is aimed more broadly at strengthening quality investigative work and protections for freedom of the press.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Between these grants and those announced last week, Barr has now awarded close to $2.5 million as part of this Special Initiative. We are also engaged in discussions with other potential partners, and we remain in close dialogue with community leaders and our funder colleagues and intend to share updates of further grantmaking later this spring.</p>\n<p>As I wrote last month, <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/in-changing-times-philanthropy-must-adapt\">changing times require philanthropy to adapt</a>, and this Special Initiative represents part of our own effort at Barr to demonstrate that aspiration in action. We are grateful for the opportunity to support many new (and some longstanding) partners through this initiative, and we appreciate their flexibility and active engagement with us as we moved swiftly to advance their important work.</p>\n<p><a class=\"button -medium -outline\" data-track='{\"type\":\"event\",\"category\":\"Button\",\"action\":\"View our grants database\",\"label\":\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/grantmaking/grants\"}' href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/grantmaking/grants\">View our grants database</a></p>\n"

      "Title": "From the President",
      "Field2": "\n\n<p>Spring has arrived in Boston and the spirit of renewal is in the air. Whether it’s budding leaves on the trees in the Public Garden, the burst of color from newly-planted flowers around the city, or the palpable energy in the streets as a long and arduous winter recedes, it has felt emblematic to arrive this spring to a new professional home at the Barr Foundation. Indeed, the theme of change and renewal pervades much of Boston right now, with a new mayor, an impending gubernatorial election, and a search for a new superintendent of schools, along with all of the new opportunities that come with such leadership transitions. </p>\n<p>At the Barr Foundation we too are concluding our own leadership transition and beginning the process of envisioning the future. Many have asked what changes Barr will make, how quickly we will make them, and how specifically the Foundation’s priorities will evolve. These are fair questions.  </p>\n<p>My answers are largely informed by what I have observed as an all-too familiar pattern during my two decades in the field of philanthropy: A new leader arrives. Planning consumes the foundation while partners in the field are left confused and uncertain. The former work of the foundation is often dismissed or marginalized as new priorities emerge and long-term relationships with partners in the field come to an abrupt end.  </p>\n<p>I can commit to you: this will not be our script at Barr.  </p>\n<p>Change will undoubtedly come to the Barr Foundation and our strategies will surely evolve as we explore opportunities for growth and expansion. However, we will approach this growth and change with transparency and care. As a newcomer to this community engaging with new colleagues and partners, my highest priority in these early days is not to impose new directions, but to listen and to learn. To do so I will draw on the extensive networks that Barr has cultivated over many years and, at the same time, I will complement those networks by engaging with leaders who may not be part of Barr’s universe today.  </p>\n<p>In my view the best philanthropy often emerges from a spirit of inquiry and curiosity, and it is that approach that will animate how Barr considers its options for the future. At the same time we have no intention of reinventing the wheel. We recognize that there are some tenets about the work of philanthropy that are tried and true:    </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identifying, supporting, and nurturing talented and visionary leaders is one of the most effective roles philanthropy can play to drive social change.</li>\n<li>Working in partnership and embracing a collaborative spirit is more effective than going it alone.</li>\n<li>Investing in building durable institutions—as much as supporting effective programs—is critical to long-term success.</li>\n<li>Approaching foundation work with a healthy dose of humility that acknowledges the privilege of stewarding philanthropic resources is essential.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the months ahead I will use this space to communicate about our plans and decisions. You will also begin to see other changes that convey how Barr will evolve. We recently joined Twitter (<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/barrfdn\">@BarrFdn</a>) and I invite you to follow our institutional handle, as well as to follow me (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/jcanales\">@jcanales</a>). We will be adding sections to our website that animate our intention to be more transparent and we will continue to share lessons from our work in the field.  </p>\n<p>In addition building upon Barbara Hostetter’s <a href=\"/blog/a-word-of-thanks-to-a-gifted-leader\">recent communication</a>, I offer my thanks to Melinda Marble, who has served as Barr’s interim executive director. As I assume my new responsibilities, I know that I inherit an organization that is stronger and more prepared for change because of Melinda’s leadership and commitment. Her deep and nuanced knowledge of the Boston community, along with her rich experience in philanthropy, make Melinda an invaluable resource, and I am delighted that we will have ample opportunities to work together as she assumes her new role as director of family philanthropy for Pilot House Associates.  </p>\n<p>I am both honored and excited to lead the Barr Foundation, building on the creative and thoughtful leadership by Barr’s previous executive directors, Marion Kane and Pat Brandes, and informed by the wisdom and vision of Barr’s founders and my co-trustees, Barbara and Amos Hostetter. We are jointly dedicated to ensuring that Barr will realize its full promise and, importantly, improve the lives of many who are touched by our work on educational opportunity, climate change, and arts and culture, as well as our global efforts.  </p>\n<p>I appreciate the warm welcome I have received from my new community I am delighted to call home and I look forward to meeting many of you in the months ahead.</p>\n"

      "Title": "And We Sing Well, Too",
      "Field2": "\n\n<p>There is a Yiddish proverb: the man with money is smart, good looking, and he sings well, too. Working for a foundation makes one a “man with money.” It’s been years since anyone looked at me and said “that’s a dumb question.” My advice and recommendations are invariably received with politeness—even enthusiasm—that far exceeds their value.</p>\n<p>Because of this dynamic, foundations have few opportunities to receive candid feedback. This is why we periodically engage <a href=\"http://cep.org\">The Center for Effective Philanthropy</a> (CEP) to administer its <a href=\"http://cep.org/assessments/grantee-and-applicant-perception-reports/\">Grantee Perception Report</a> to our grantees. This report provides an invaluable opportunity to gather feedback on their experience of Barr. And with over 40,000 responses and 290 funders in CEP’s dataset, it also allows us to benchmark ourselves against our peers.</p>\n<p>Barr worked with CEP first in 2003, again in 2007, and most recently in 2012, when more than 100 grantees responded. It was gratifying to learn that, compared to 2007, our grantees see Barr as having a more positive impact on their fields. However, grantees also rated the quality of their relationships with Barr staff lower than they did in the past.</p>\n<p>This was bad news. For me, success in any organization depends both on high performance and strong partners. We know our work at Barr depends on strong relationships of mutual trust and respect with grantees. They are the ones who carry out the work, after all. </p>\n<p>So we recommitted ourselves to strengthening those relationships and we set about to better understand the findings in a 100-day improvement project. Over the summer we hosted three focus groups, attended by more than eighty grantees. These were designed and facilitated with great skill by consultant Cynthia Gibson, who created an atmosphere in which grantees could be very candid. These sessions deepened our understanding of the survey results.</p>\n<p>While we heard some praise, many grantees felt that their interactions with Barr had grown more transactional over the years and that our application process was cumbersome. In particular, we heard a strong desire for more personal, substantive relationships with program officers. We also heard many great ideas and suggestions for improvement.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most poignant and on-point feedback was the strong desire that we listen more. The focus groups were our attempt to start that, and the grantees who attended were incredibly generous with their insights, and they expressed appreciation for the opportunity to share them. Many pointed out that they had never been asked before about the quality of their relationship with a donor.</p>\n<p>In response, Barr staff worked to define the kind of experience we want grant seekers to have. During the 100 days, each program officer had a conversation with at least one grantee—not about their project or proposal, but their relationship with Barr and how it could be strengthened. These were enlightening, and a reminder of the power of a simple conversation. </p>\n<p>We completely revised our grantmaking process, removing excess questions and structuring it to be easier for grant seekers to make their case. We created new ways for grant-seekers to <a href=\"/grantmaking#feedback\">give us feedback</a> and to introduce us to new grant ideas.</p>\n<p>We have given program assistants more responsibility to clearly convey next steps and guide grant-seekers through every phase of the process. We are also looking at our internal processes, finding ways to simplify wherever we can to free up program staff to spend more time in the field, listening, learning, and supporting our grantees.</p>\n<p>Finally, we are also doing professional development work together that reminds us to listen better and question our assumptions—two safeguards against the unintentional arrogance that sometimes develops when funders get too far from the field. We’re also exploring time management and the overload that can happen with too many meetings and internal processes.</p>\n<p>How are we doing? We will rely on our grantees to help us answer that question. We intend to take more frequent soundings, including sending each grant applicant a brief survey to comment on the review process.</p>\n<p>When I step down as interim director, I hope to leave Barr a little better balanced in its quest for big impact and strong relationships. I hope grantees feel more at liberty to let me know when I am singing off key. And I hope you will let us know what you think of our efforts.</p>\n<p><em>Updated February 3, 2015</em></p>\n"

      "Field2": "\n\n<p>Earlier this month I attended the first of several community meetings focused on hearing from residents about the prospect of Boston hosting the 2024 Olympics. Hundreds packed the hall and overflow space at Suffolk Law School, and the spirit of active engagement and respectful dialogue was evident. What was especially exciting was the strong interest in a topic that touches, at its core, a deeper question about the kind of Boston we envision.</p>\n<p>Ever since Boston was named as the U.S. bid city for the 2024 Olympics, this has been a constant topic of conversation, with daily coverage in the media and sizable coalitions gathering with strong views on both sides. Some are convinced a Boston Olympics would be the catalyst for a positive transformation of the region, yielding benefits for generations to come. Others are equally convinced it would be a costly distraction from more important priorities.</p>\n<p>Given Barr’s priority areas of Arts and Culture, Education, and Climate, the planning for the Olympics—and a successful bid—would no doubt affect the work we support and our partners in ways we can only begin to imagine. As a result, we felt it important to communicate clearly about the Foundation’s position on this issue and how we intend to engage going forward.</p>\n<p>Put simply, the Barr Foundation takes no position on the 2024 Olympics. At the same time, as an organization committed to the stewardship of the human, cultural, and natural resources in this region, we adopt a long-term view—frankly, even longer than 2024—so to the extent this dialogue serves to advance action in areas where we and our partners are currently engaged, we find that encouraging.</p>\n<p>For example, the discussion about Boston 2024 is prompting an important dialogue about the transportation needs in the region (and the unprecedented snow this winter has only further contributed to that). Transportation has long been a key focus for Barr because of our concerns about climate change. Indeed, our support of the <a href=\"http://goboston2030.org/en\">Go Boston 2030</a> transportation visioning process, which Barr supported before anyone knew the outcome of the Olympic bid, seeks to broaden engagement on this critical issue. This is but one example of an area that may intersect with the discussion about the Olympics, but where our involvement is motivated principally by an abiding concern for the long-term implications of the decisions we make today.</p>\n<p>Should Barr’s position on this matter change or evolve further, I commit to sharing that with you.</p>\n"

I am pleased that <a href=\"/bios/christi-craig\">Christi Tritton</a>, who has served as a program assistant for the past two and a half years, will assume this new role.</li>\n<li>We have created the position of director of operations and I am delighted that <a href=\"/bios/ify-mora\">Ify Mora</a>, who has served ably as chief of staff for several years, will take on this leadership role. In her new role, Ify will assume lead responsibility for the effective operations of the Foundation. This includes taking a fresh look at our existing policies and procedures with an eye toward streamlining simplifying and striving towards continuous improvement in how we operate.</li>\n<li>In the past Barr has depended upon a small group of program assistants to support multiple functions across the Foundation. As we prepare for growth and expansion, each core program area at the Foundation will have a dedicated program assistant to more effectively support each team and their many external partners. Accordingly Lauren Woody will now focus on Arts &amp; Culture and <a href=\"/bios/emily-sidla\">Emily Sidla</a> will be dedicated to the Global program. We are also initiating a search at this time for a new program assistant in Climate, and we will initiate a search this fall for a program assistant in Education.</li>\n<li>Finally, in order to support a range of critical projects across the Foundation, we have hired a manager of special projects, reporting to me. I am delighted to announce the appointment of <a href=\"/bios/trevor-pollack\">Trevor Pollack</a> to this role. Trevor currently serves as associate director for institutional giving at the <a href=\"http://www.handelandhaydn.org\">Handel and Haydn Society</a> and will join the Barr team in mid-August.<br/></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This reorganization of people and functions is principally intended to ensure we are structured in ways that enable us to serve our partners well and as effectively as possible. I will continue using this space to communicate about additional changes when appropriate and appreciate your ongoing interest in the work of the Barr Foundation.</p>\n"

      "Field2": "\n\n<p>It is my great pleasure to announce the appointment of Jenny Curtin as senior program officer with the Barr Foundation’s Education team.</p>\n<p>Jenny joins Barr after more than a decade at the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, where she has served since 2010 as coordinator for High School Initiatives. In this leadership role, she has overseen several state efforts related to secondary school improvement and supporting students who are most likely to drop out of high school. These include the MassGrad Initiative, which has contributed to steady gains in high school graduation rates and significant reductions in the high school dropout rate. Jenny also helped to develop the statewide Early Warning Indicator System, which helps districts and schools identify and target supports to students at risk of not meeting academic goals.</p>\n<div class=\"Media -small -left\"> <div class=\"Media-imageWrapper\"> <img alt=\"Jenny Curtain\" class=\"Media-image\" src=\"https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/760/crop_preview.jpg?1642117645\"/> </div> </div>\n<p>A graduate of Tulane University, Jenny received a master’s in public policy and certificate in nonprofit management from Johns Hopkins University.</p>\n<p>Jenny’s work in education in Massachusetts has spanned grantmaking, program evaluation, and training, which has resulted in a robust statewide network of community and district partners.</p>\n<p>Her expertise on a variety of secondary school topics, as well as her deep knowledge of the education policy landscape, both in Massachusetts and nationally, will be valuable as the Education team explores opportunities in the Commonwealth and in New England to align with broader efforts focused on secondary success for all students (for more on this topic and its influence on Barr’s planning, <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/connecting-all-students-to-success-in-and-beyond-high-school\">see my recent post</a>).</p>\n<p>As Barr’s Education team nears the end of its planning process and prepares to embark on a next phase of work to connect all students to success, we are thrilled about the new energy, ideas, skills, and relationships Jenny will bring to bear. We look forward to her arrival on January 4, and to introducing her personally to our partners in the months to come.</p>\n"

In her time with us, she sharpened our work with the Boston Public Schools, made significant investments in several major partners, and helped us all better understand how state and national education reform affects our local efforts. She also began working to outline a visioning process for a fundamental redesign of American education. The deeper Wendy got into this latter piece of work, the stronger her desire grew to devote herself to it full time, and to do so from a more national platform than Barr can presently provide.</p>\n<p>With <a href=\"/blog/announcing-barrs-first-president\">Jim Canales joining us as president this May</a>, we do not have immediate plans to launch a search for a new education director. As we move forward at Barr and as we learn more about Wendy’s next steps, we will do our best to communicate them, including via Barr’s website.</p>\n<p>Wendy and I first worked together more than twenty years ago at The Boston Foundation. She has been one of my mentors and role models, and she has been a wonderful companion and adviser to me during my time as interim executive director at Barr. I am grateful that her warm presence and bold ideas will remain with us as she seeks the right home for her future work.</p>\n<p>Please join all of us in wishing Wendy well in her next adventure.</p>\n"

      "Title": "Barr Commits Over $2 Million for Vaccine Equity Efforts",
      "Field2": "\n\n<p><em>Pictured above: EMT Alex Honrado prepares to administer COVID-19 vaccines at the Reggie Lewis Center Mass Vaccination Site in Boston.</em></p>\n<p>As Massachusetts has been rolling out COVID-19 vaccines, concerns about equity remain paramount. As <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/03/12/nation/state-data-reveal-stark-ethnic-disparities-vaccination-rates/\">reported recently in the Boston Globe</a>, there remain significant disparities in vaccination rates, especially for those racial and ethnic groups who have been most impacted by the pandemic. </p>\n<p>Against this backdrop, over the past number of weeks, Barr has coordinated with multiple local funders to explore how we could best complement what the public sector is doing to address these concerns. We have been particularly focused on reaching those communities affected disproportionately by the COVID-19 pandemic, many of which are communities of color. </p>\n<p>Today, we are pleased to announce over $2 million in grants to support a range of aligned activities centered on vaccine equity. </p>\n<p>Barr has awarded $1 million to the Massachusetts League of Community Health Centers to enable the League to direct resources expeditiously to community health centers as they expand vaccination efforts. We join six other funders, which have cumulatively committed $4.35 million for this vital work.</p>\n<p>Serving more than one million residents, Massachusetts’ community health centers are essential distribution channels in the equitable delivery of the vaccine, given their proximity to communities of color and the trusted role they occupy in their communities. As the Kaiser Family Foundation <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/are-health-centers-facilitating-equitable-access-to-covid-19-vaccinations/\">recently reported</a>, more than half of those patients receiving first doses of the vaccine from community health centers have been people of color. </p>\n<p>In addition, in order to support on-the-ground outreach and education efforts targeted to communities disproportionately affected by COVID-19, we are co-funding with the <a href=\"https://www.boston.gov/departments/treasury/boston-resiliency-fund\">Boston Resiliency Fund</a> and the Klarman Family Foundation the efforts of four community-based coalitions: the <a href=\"https://blackbostoncoalition.org/\">Black Boston COVID-19 Coalition</a>, the Chinatown Collaborative, the <a href=\"http://greaterbostonlatinonetwork.org/\">Greater Boston Latino Network</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.csioboston.org/\">Center to Support Immigrant Organizing</a>. This funding, totaling $475,000 from Barr, will support some 30+ organizations engaged in local, community-based outreach and education focused on vaccine equity.</p>\n<p>In alignment with these efforts in Boston, we are awarding a total of $500,000 in grants to community foundations in <a href=\"https://www.eccf.org/\">Essex County</a>, <a href=\"https://www.greaterworcester.org/Grants/About-Grant-Opportunities\">Greater Worcester</a>, <a href=\"https://communityfoundation.org/\">Western Massachusetts</a>, and <a href=\"https://southcoastcf.org/\">South Coast</a> to support local regranting efforts in each region for community-based organizations focused on vaccine equity. We selected these four regions of the state because there is significant overlap between the geographic areas served by these community foundations and the <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/news/baker-polito-administration-launches-targeted-outreach-initiative-in-20-hardest-hit\">twenty cities identified by the State as priorities for vaccine equity</a>. We also have a strong working relationship with each of these community foundations as part of Barr’s <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/arts-creativity/creative-commonwealth\">Creative Commonwealth Initiative</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, Barr is also providing support to the advocacy efforts of the Vaccine Equity Now! Coalition, consisting of ten civil rights, racial justice and public health leadership organizations that have shaped recommendations for the State to address disparities in the vaccine rollout. We already partner with many of these organizations in other areas, and we value their leadership and perspective. </p>\n<p>In my most <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/time-to-reimagine-what-can-be-not-rebuild-what-was\">recent blog post</a>, I suggested four ways we as funders need to adapt our work based on the experience of this past year. In making this new set of grants, we went to the leaders of these various organizations and coalitions and asked them how we could help, what funding they needed, and how best to structure grants and reporting to support them. We also moved with the dispatch that this moment requires of us all – grateful for the focused, responsive, and dedicated leadership of these organizations, and their unwavering commitment to ensuring an equitable rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. We are in their debt and proud to support this work.</p>\n<p><a class=\"button -medium\" data-track=\"{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;event&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;Button&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;Learn more about Barr's COVID-19 Grantmaking&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://www.barrfoundation.org/covid-19&quot;}\" href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/covid-19\">Learn more about Barr's COVID-19 Grantmaking</a></p>\n"

      "Title": "Time to Reimagine What Can Be, Not Rebuild What Was",
      "Field2": "\n\n<p>One year ago this week, my colleagues and I shifted to remote work. As I reflect back on my own feelings at this time last year, I vividly recall two overriding sentiments that characterized those days in March 2020: the <em>uncertainty</em> of what might come next, and the <em>fear</em> about this deadly virus circulating in our midst. Despite the rapidly changing circumstances, we at the Barr Foundation knew we had to anchor ourselves on one driving principle: care and support of both our staff and grantee partners, all of whom were facing unprecedented challenges.</p>\n<p>A year later, uncertainty and fear are giving way to clarity and hope: clarity that we <strong>will</strong> emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic and a sense of hope about the future that lies ahead. Today, a new idea has become central for us: as we physically return to our places of work, we must heed the lessons of the past year to reimagine this work, not to rebuild what was. </p>\n<p>In a year that has resulted in enormous loss of life—with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html\">over 2.6 million global deaths</a> from COVID-19—it is plainly evident to us that there can and should be no return to the way things were pre-pandemic. To confront structural racism, massive wealth inequality, power imbalances, and other obstacles to the equitable world we aspire to, we must understand our role, as a philanthropic institution, in how we got here. And, we must reimagine that role to move forward.</p>\n<p>In response to the challenges of 2020, we shifted how we operate. We sought to more explicitly center the needs of our partners and make tangible Barr’s <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/an-enduring-commitment-to-racial-equity\">expanded commitment to racial equity</a>. Today, I highlight four ways we are committed to building upon what we learned and the potential it has to make us a better partner. We hope others will share their lessons too:</p>\n<h3>We will continue grantmaking practices that enable us to respond flexibly and quickly to the needs of our partners.</h3>\n<p>As many funders have done during COVID-19, we offered flexibility to our partners in various ways to ensure they could direct resources to the highest needs as they saw them. We reoriented reporting to us in ways that minimize workload for our partners. Knowing the value of multi-year, general operating support, we converted many existing grants accordingly to support our partners during the pandemic. Many of these practices were put in place in response to COVID-19, but we intend to continue those changes that have served our grantees best. </p>\n<h3>We will prioritize trust and relationships over transactions and oversight.</h3>\n<p>Many of the shifts in practice we instituted this year invited us to relinquish control. This desire for control is so often at the heart of many of our policies and procedures as funders. While we want to believe that we had built productive and strong relationships with our grantees, this year encouraged us to test that, by trusting more, and by investing in leaders who understood the shifting needs and emerging demands of their communities in ways we could not. This was a year where building on relationships we had cultivated over time really mattered, and that only underscores these relational aspects of our work which must remain paramount.</p>\n<h3>We will center our work on racial equity.</h3>\n<p>Each of our program teams has spent significant time engaging with grantees and other partners to deepen their understanding of racial equity in their fields and the implications for our programs, specifically what we fund, who we fund, and how we fund. You will be hearing more in the coming months about what this means for our programs and Barr overall. We will also continue the necessary work of examining our own culture and practices as we explore more deeply what it means to be an anti-racist organization. </p>\n<h3>We will collaborate with other funders to align efforts and minimize the administrative burdens we create for nonprofits.</h3>\n<p>The value of doing so was most evident in the grantmaking efforts Barr undertook to respond to emergency needs created by COVID-19. As grantees mobilized to support their communities, numerous relief funds were launched, and funders sought to coordinate efforts to avoid duplication. Funders met with increasing frequency to share information, and many of us collaborated on grants in ways we had never done before. While this facilitated our own work, we also realized that there were many benefits for our partners: shared applications, unified reporting, and faster decision-making. Indeed, in some of this work funders went to grantees and <em>asked them what they needed</em> without waiting for them to come to us for support. There is every reason to continue this approach.</p>\n<p>These are just a few of the lessons we will carry forward, acknowledging we are a work in progress with much more to learn. To that end, we are committed to listening to our partners, to understanding their needs, and to being open to change, where new ways of working will serve them better. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"Pullquote\"> <p>We are committed to listening to our partners, to understanding their needs, and to being open to change, where new ways of working will serve them better.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>On this sobering anniversary of events that set in motion an unprecedented year, what has most heartened and bolstered me has been the tireless and persistent dedication of our partners. We have watched organizations pivot and adapt. We have witnessed new alliances and coalitions emerge. We have been inspired by the tenacity and clear-eyed commitment of so many leaders. Their work has been a lifeline to communities hit hard by the pandemic.</p>\n<p>I also know from my own conversations with many of these leaders just how tired and overwhelmed they have been, feeling that their only choice was to lean in, to do more, and to rise to new obligations. If nothing else, we as funders owe it to them to interrogate how we can be better partners, emerging from this experience more attuned to their needs, more invested in their success, and more prepared to relinquish control and share power. </p>\n<p>This is how we will best honor the sacrifices so many have made to ensure our communities could see their way through all of the fear and uncertainty to today, as hope springs anew.</p>\n"

      "Title": "What We’re Learning from a Regional Approach",
      "Field2": "\n\n<p>In 2014, in light of anticipated growth in the Barr Foundation’s giving capacity and opportunities to increase impact across Barr’s core issues, our trustees decided to expand the focus for the Foundation’s work from Boston to the region. Our program strategies, announced in early 2016, embody this new vision. What has that meant for our work? What new opportunities and challenges have we found? And what have we learned? We recently reflected on these questions with our trustees, and I offer here some of the key takeaways from that conversation. </p>\n<h3>Focus on opportunity, not lines on a map</h3>\n<p>Even as Barr’s geography has expanded, our trustees’ principal concern has remained impact on our core issues, rather than coverage of a region. Given that orientation, they invited each program team to determine what approach made the most sense, given its context and goals. As a result, each program defined “region” in a different way and tailored its approach to learning about how its issues were playing out over a broader geography, establishing new relationships, and investing in new areas of work.  </p>\n<blockquote class=\"Pullquote\"> <p>Even as Barr’s geography has expanded, our trustees’ principal concern has remained impact on our core issues, rather than coverage of a region. </p> </blockquote>\n<p>The <strong>Arts &amp; Creativity</strong> Program, for example, defined its region as <strong>Massachusetts</strong>. As one approach to building our understanding of local issues across the state, enhancing the capacity and resources for local art ecosystems, and building allies for the arts statewide, the Foundation has partnered with five community foundations with planning grants to explore opportunities to be more strategic in their support for arts and creativity in their communities. </p>\n<p>Based on the regional nature of the energy infrastructure and the program’s heavy focus on policy, the <strong>Clean Energy</strong> portfolio in our Climate Program defined its region as the <strong>Northeast</strong> (i.e., New England plus New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania).  In addition to targeted efforts in New England, Barr is working with the Energy Foundation, a national partnership of philanthropies supporting a network of grantees advancing clean energy, to advance efforts in key states like Pennsylvania and New York, and to build our knowledge of the policy environment in those states.  </p>\n<p>Given the important role that cities, towns, and states play in planning and policy for transportation and community development, the <strong>Mobility</strong> portfolio in our Climate Program defined its region as <strong>Massachusetts</strong>. In this strategy, alongside intensive work in Boston, a grant to the Consensus Building Institute supported Massachusetts’ State Senate President in conducting a series of conversations, titled “MassMoves,” which have engaged citizens across Massachusetts in conversations that elicit their views and begin to create consensus on shared transportation goals across the Commonwealth. </p>\n<p>Barr’s <strong>Education</strong> Program chose to define <strong>New England</strong> as its region. In the summer and fall of 2016, the Education team engaged in extensive outreach, visits, and data gathering across New England, including a Request for Information last fall, to inform its understanding of opportunities to better connect all students to success in high school and beyond. This was a first step in what has since become Barr’s <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/education/engage-new-england\"><em>Engage New England: Doing High School Differently</em></a> initiative, with a first set of grants awarded in June 2017 to a range of compelling efforts across the region.</p>\n<p>Our conversation with the trustees reaffirmed this approach of focusing on opportunities, not lines on a map. However a program has defined its region, the goal is to identify strong partners and the highest-potential projects aligned with our goals wherever they may be in that region. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"Pullquote\"> <p>Our conversation with the trustees reaffirmed this approach of focusing on opportunities, not lines on a map.</p> </blockquote>\n<h3>Expanded opportunities for impact</h3>\n<p>Clearly we’re still in the early stages of our regionalization, with much still to learn and real impacts farther down the road. However, all of our program teams have already found that Barr’s regional expansion has presented significant new opportunities for extending the Foundation’s impact. Well beyond simply funding more projects, a regional focus has positioned us in new ways to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Build broad-based vision, public support, and leadership:</strong> In each of our program areas, strengthening and broadening the base of engagement, capacity, and advocacy across the state is critical. We expect that high-quality, high-visibility pilots in diverse locations can offer concrete examples, lift visions, connect communities across the region, and inform and inspire the wide range of important stakeholders on our core issues.</li>\n<li><strong>Identify and invest in effective leaders:</strong> Engaging with the region has already allowed us to begin to identify the leaders and innovators pushing practice and policy across the region in ways that cross geographic boundaries.  With a regional approach, we can help those leaders deepen their work, highlight their examples, and build their capacity to support others who are not as far along.<br/></li>\n<li><strong>Build and strengthen our fields and networks:</strong> Beyond the work of individual grants, we have seen the need and opportunity for field-building and have begun to develop cohorts and networks of grantees working toward similar goals. We have also started to offer technical assistance and learning opportunities focused on targeted needs identified by these partners.</li>\n<li><strong>Build capacity for thoughtful engagement on local, regional, and national policy:</strong> Across all of these areas, state (and sometimes regional) policy has a significant impact on local practices and possibilities. With a regional approach, there are far more levers to inform the critical policies that enable local work. Even though Barr does not have a primary focus on national policy, we believe a regional approach will help build the knowledge and credibility to be visible and to weigh in on the national discourse—and to support our grantees in engaging in that discourse.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Reflecting on challenges and lessons</h3>\n<p>This kind of expansion is not without its challenges. Primary among them is staff time and capacity. Building relationships and trust is key to accessing authentic understanding of issues and dynamics; those steps take staff time and don’t happen overnight.</p>\n<p>There are other challenges, as well. Given the Foundation’s preference for lean staffing and our goal to build capacity in the field, we regularly partner with intermediaries that bring knowledge of leading practices, policies, and research—and we recognize that intermediaries sometimes themselves require capacity-building investments.</p>\n<p>We will continue to assess our progress in formal and informal ways, seeking to understand what has worked and what hasn’t and ensuring that all we do remains true to the Foundation’s values. At our staff retreat next month, we will reflect on how our regionalization affects the way we work with grantees in light of our goal to serve as a constructive partner. We are excited to <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/barr-announces-director-of-learning-and-evaluation\">bring on a director of learning and evaluation</a>, who will help us assess these efforts in more systematic ways. We have also asked The Center for Effective Philanthropy to <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/grantmaking#feedback\">gather feedback from our grantees</a> this fall through the Grantee Perception Report, which will provide direct feedback on how we’re doing. And we will continue our conversations as a staff team and with our trustees to reflect and adjust as necessary.</p>\n<h3>Looking forward</h3>\n<p>Despite some expected challenges, regionalization has created exciting new opportunities to expand our geographic footprint and to deepen knowledge and potential impact in each of Barr’s program areas. We continue to learn how best to implement high-impact work across our region, and we invite you to share your observations with our team, both positive and critical, to help us move forward effectively.</p>\n"

      "Title": "In Changing Times, Philanthropy Must Adapt",
      "Field2": "\n\n<p>In light of dramatic shifts in the national context, we at Barr have been grappling with how best to respond. The success of any grantmaking foundation relies upon partners for whom new policies from Washington can provide tailwinds, headwinds, or even—as many are experiencing lately—existential threats. This is true in distinct ways for each of Barr’s focus areas—arts and creativity, climate change, and education—as it is for a host of other issues. Amidst so much uncertainty, through conversations among our staff and trustees, with grantees, and many other colleagues, we have landed on four core principles to help us navigate these times:</p>\n<h3>Adapt strategies</h3>\n<p>Planning is essential, but inflexible reliance upon such plans in the face of change may be just as bad as not planning at all. Just a year ago, <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/stewards-catalysts-barr-foundation-next-chapter-jim-canales\">we announced</a> Barr’s new strategic directions. As we did, we described the balance we hoped to strike between focus and flexibility, between having “staying power on complex and vital issues while avoiding rigidity.” We know the most effective strategies are never static, but must be refined and adapted based on what we learn along the way, and in response to change. </p>\n<p>At a time when so much is changing and at a pace that makes it hard to keep up, the importance of adaptability cannot be overstated. “We cannot direct the winds,” goes the famous (unattributed) saying, “but we can adjust the sails.”  It is time for philanthropy to adjust its sails.</p>\n<h3>Remain true to values</h3>\n<p>As other nonprofits have been describing how to proceed in this new context, one unifying theme has been clear: we must stay true to our values. Several colleagues have written eloquently on this theme, including <a href=\"http://www.heinz.org/about-us/board-and-staff#\">Grant Oliphant</a> of The Heinz Endowments, who urged foundations, as an expression of their values, to use their voice and actively engage right now; and <a href=\"https://www.irvine.org/blog/standing-up-for-immigrants\">Don Howard</a>, who outlined tangible plans The James Irvine Foundation has already taken in defense of its values. </p>\n<p>We have the good fortune of being grounded by <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/about#core-values\">clear values</a> at Barr. Our responses to the challenges of the moment—and any on the horizon—will be governed by these. At times, our values will also spur us to engage in partnerships outside our defined focus areas and strategies. For example, we recently joined many other funders to sign a <a href=\"https://www.gcir.org/joint-foundation-statement-immigration#statement\">joint statement</a> (under the auspices of <a href=\"https://www.gcir.org\">Grantmakers Concerned for Immigrants and Refugees</a>) underscoring the important roles immigrants and refugees occupy in our country and the need to protect them.  </p>\n<blockquote class=\"Pullquote\"> <p>At times, our values will also spur us to engage in partnerships outside our defined focus areas and strategies.</p> </blockquote>\n<h3>Listen attentively</h3>\n<p>More than ever, philanthropy must understand what its partners need in order to be successful in this different context. This requires outreach on our part and careful listening. It may require reconsidering budgets, priorities, or objectives. These are active conversations we are having with our partners at Barr, and they will certainly continue. Beyond listening to partners, we also need to listen beyond our existing networks, to ensure community voices are actively engaged, and that our efforts are informed by a range of perspectives. </p>\n<h3>Invest in a healthy democracy</h3>\n<p>Finally, this moment has made evident the urgency for philanthropy to support those advocating for marginalized populations, protecting human rights and civil liberties, and ensuring the vitality of fact-based reporting and research. While these areas may not fit neatly into Barr’s current program areas and strategies, the moment compels us to engage. Accordingly, we are exploring targeted opportunities to invest in a healthy democracy. While these explorations are in their early days, we will have more to report in the weeks ahead, including awarding initial grants by early spring. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"Pullquote\"> <p>Barr’s mission statement centers on investing in potential. Inherent to that aspiration is the imperative of connecting people—especially those facing barriers or obstacles—to opportunities, so that they may thrive and succeed.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>At their best, mission statements guide and inspire. Barr’s mission statement centers on “investing in potential.” Inherent to that aspiration is the imperative of connecting people—especially those facing barriers or obstacles—to opportunities, so that they may thrive and succeed. </p>\n<p>This is our principal motivation at Barr, and we are proud to partner with others committed to the ideals of equity, inclusion, and opportunity that underlie that aspiration. Our active engagement in defense of these ideals may be more important now than ever. </p>\n"

Their arrival as trustees marks a significant milestone for the Foundation.  </p>\n<p>The process we went through to arrive at this point afforded us an opportunity to reflect on how much has changed since we formed the Foundation and what is vital as we plan for Barr’s future. It is now 20 years since the original gift that set in motion the development of a professionally staffed philanthropy. Today, we have an $80-million grantmaking budget and ambitious strategies to fulfill our mission of investing in potential.</p>\n<p>For 17 of these 20 years, Barr was governed solely by its two co-founders.

Soon after his arrival, the three of us began in earnest to consider what further expansion of the board should look like.</p>\n<p>In the spirit of transparency, and to the extent that it may be useful to others, I want to shed some light on four important decisions we made about governance and the rationale behind those decisions.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"Pullquote Pullquote--short\"> <p>I want to shed some light on four important decisions we made about governance and the rationale behind those decisions.</p> </blockquote>\n<h3>Board Composition</h3>\n<p>As we went about the process of identifying new trustees, we thought carefully about the key attributes that should inform those selections. Perhaps the most important consideration for us was alignment with the Foundation’s values. Chief among those is our commitment to humility.</p>\n<p>Of course, we also sought individuals who would bring an understanding of and appreciation for Barr’s core programs. Yet we were not looking for subject-matter experts. We have always viewed Barr as a learning organization and accordingly sought trustees who share an ambition to learn with us. This means we sought good listeners whose curiosity was as apparent as their expertise.</p>\n<p>Finally, we remained attentive to diversity of backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives beyond our existing networks. We are delighted that in Sue and Lee we were able to find leaders who embodied all of these qualities.</p>\n<h3>Board Role and Size</h3>\n<p>We continue to view the role of the board as providing strategic direction and fiduciary oversight, working in partnership with a talented staff and empowering them to do their best work. To do that well, we want to strike the right balance between a board that is large enough to bring diversity of perspective and experience to our deliberations, but also small enough to ensure cohesion and to enable productive discussions. Given these considerations, we believe the optimal board size for Barr will be between eight to 12 trustees. We envision gradually expanding the board to this size over the next five years.</p>\n<h3>Family Engagement</h3>\n<p>It remains important to us that future generations of our family have opportunities to engage with the Barr Foundation if they would like to. We also view Barr as undergoing a transition from a family philanthropy to a legacy foundation that will be governed by a majority of non-family trustees. Indeed, with the addition of Sue and Lee, that is now the case.</p>\n<p>It is our aspiration that the work of the Barr Foundation will continue to be strategic, highly leveraged, and impactful, and that family members who participate on the board have opportunities to learn from, engage with, and contribute to an experienced group of trustees and talented staff members.</p>\n<h3>Flexibility for the Future</h3>\n<p>As we looked to other foundations for models, we were struck by those where a set of values and culture were clear, deeply embedded, and enduring. When articulated by founders, clearly defined values and culture can offer inspiration and guidance for generations to come.</p>\n<p>All trustees are stewards of an organization’s values and culture. Yet we recognized that the first board members who join a pair of founding trustees shoulder a distinct responsibility in this regard. They are a bridge to carry those values and culture from one generation to the next.</p>\n<p>It is this focus on values and culture that is paramount to us.</p>\n<p>As far as other decisions, we want to ensure that Barr’s board always retains as much flexibility as possible to respond to changing times. As a result, we are giving ample latitude to future trustees on key decisions, such as what issues the Foundation focuses on, where it aims to do its work, and even whether to exist in perpetuity or spend down the endowment. We believe that future generations should have the ability to address those questions however they deem most appropriate.</p>\n<h3>Looking Back and Looking Forward</h3>\n<p>In reflecting upon the past 20 years of governing the Barr Foundation, if we have learned nothing else, it is that the thoughtful stewardship of philanthropy is neither trivial nor easy work. It is both serious and hard.</p>\n<p>I am also so very humbled and grateful to all who contributed to making the Barr Foundation what it is today—our staff, our funding partners, other colleagues, and most importantly, the leaders and organizations we have been honored to support.</p>\n<p>We are excited about this next phase of the Foundation’s development and so fortunate that Sue and Lee will be part of it.</p>\n<div class=\"Media -full -right\"> <div class=\"Media-imageWrapper\"> <img alt=\"Barr Foundation Board of Trustees\" class=\"Media-image\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px\" src=\"https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1908/small.jpg?1642121328\" srcset=\"https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1908/small.jpg?1642121328 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1908/medium.jpg?1642121328 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1908/large.jpg?1642121328 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1908/x_large.jpg?1642121328 1600w\"/> </div> </div>\n<h4>Learn more about Lee and Sue by watching the below videos.</h4>\n<div class=\"Media -full\"> <div class=\"u-fluid-iframe\"> <div class=\"u-fluid-iframe-inner\"> <iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" data-ready=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/260049568?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0\" title=\"Video: Lee Pelton on investing in young people\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\"> <a href=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/260049568?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0\">A video on Vimeo</a> </iframe> </div> </div> </div>\n<div class=\"Media -full\"> <div class=\"u-fluid-iframe\"> <div class=\"u-fluid-iframe-inner\"> <iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" data-ready=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/260049810?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0\" title=\"Video: Sue Tierney on advancing solutions to climate change\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\"> <a href=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/260049810?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0\">A video on Vimeo</a> </iframe> </div> </div> </div>\n"

Finally, we are grateful for the opportunity to deepen Barr’s partnership with local and national peer funders committed to striking the right balance between focus and flexibility, to be responsive to urgent needs.</p>\n<p>Next week, we will announce another cohort of grants focused on efforts to strengthen and sustain journalism and ensure protections for freedom of the press.  </p>\n<p><a class=\"button -medium -outline\" data-track='{\"type\":\"event\",\"category\":\"Button\",\"action\":\"View our grants database\",\"label\":\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/grantmaking/grants\"}' href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/grantmaking/grants\">View our grants database</a></p>\n<p><em>Updates:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><a href=\"/blog/new-barr-grants-to-promote-and-sustain-a-healthy-democracy\">“New Grants to Promote and Sustain a Healthy Democracy,”</a> published on April 4, announced the second cohort of grantees under this special initiative.</em></li>\n<li><em>Grants have also been awarded to MAS Boston Society, Massachusetts Legal Assistance Corporation, and Social Innovation Forum. <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/civil-liberties-informed-democracy\">Click here</a> to view all grants awarded under this special initiative.</em></li>\n</ul>\n"

      "Title": "Eight Questions with Barr's New Director of Learning and Evaluation",
      "Field2": "\n\n<h4>1. How did you end up in philanthropy?</h4>\n<p>I’ve always been attracted to mission-driven work. I started out as a teacher, where I wanted to work with one student and one classroom at a time for positive change. Eventually, I moved into educational evaluation, where the goal was to improve a program or an institution. Then, I shifted to philanthropy, which I saw as an opportunity to think across whole systems and explore how to support their efforts to change.</p>\n<h4>2. What excites you most about learning and evaluation work?</h4>\n<p>I’m a big fan of Michael Quinn Patton, who says that evaluators are a bit like Don Quixote: they see the world not as it is, but as it could be. As an idealist and an optimist, that really excites me. Through learning and evaluation, we can understand how to change the world and reimagine what it could be. </p>\n<h4>3. What are your top priorities at Barr for the next six months?</h4>\n<p>My long-term goal is to ensure that our program teams have the right tools and systems to evaluate progress and impact. In the short term, I’m focused on our current practices to understand what’s working and where there are opportunities for improvement. I’m diving in right away with our teams on their ongoing evaluation projects. Over the next few months, I’d like to get more concrete with the specific evaluation practices and tools we’d like to adopt. We will soon have the opportunity to learn from our <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/value-of-constructive-feedback-in-philanthropy\">Grantee Perception Report</a>, and that feedback will shape what we decide to prioritize. Ultimately, I want everyone to feel that the time they spend on learning and measuring outcomes is time well-spent. </p>\n<h4>4. What attracted you to the Barr Foundation?</h4>\n<p>Barr’s goals and culture were very much aligned with the sort of philanthropy that I find most inspiring. I love working with people who have a positive vision of the future and are passionate about changing people’s lives for the better, with values of humility and respect. Up until now, my career has been focused entirely on education and educational evaluation—including when I was at the Gates Foundation. So, I was also really attracted to the opportunity to expand my focus into arts and climate—two other issues I care deeply about. </p>\n<h4>5. Barr has been deliberate in phrasing “learning” before “evaluation.” Why emphasize “learning” first?</h4>\n<p>If we evaluate and don’t do anything with the results we find, then it’s pointless. Evaluation is a systematic way of understanding the worth of what we’re doing and understanding the “why” if change occurs, or doesn’t occur. Learning is about behavior change, including the behavior of funders and grantees. If we don’t design evaluation to be useful in catalyzing change, then it’s a waste of effort and resources. If evaluation can prompt positive change and increase our impact, we’ve reached a greater purpose.  </p>\n<blockquote class=\"Pullquote\"> <p>Evaluation is a systematic way of understanding the worth of what we’re doing and to understand the 'why' if change occurs.</p> </blockquote>\n<h4>6. In your work, where have you seen learning and evaluation be most beneficial?</h4>\n<p>Learning and evaluation are most helpful when the questions are clear, and everyone understands what the purpose of the evaluation is, and what we’ll do with the answers. Learning and evaluation should be tools for ensuring that all our good intentions, resources, and planning are focused towards achieving positive impact. </p>\n<h4>7. Are there times when learning and evaluation can be unhelpful?</h4>\n<p>When evaluation depends too much on quantitative measures and outcomes, it can actually inhibit real learning. It can put pressure on grantees to focus only on what’s working, to cherry-pick data that makes them look successful out of fear of talking about failure, and to focus too much on what was achieved. It’s crucial to focus on why programs succeeded or didn’t, and how they could be improved. If evaluation is overly focused on results, then it becomes too associated with judgment instead of learning.  </p>\n<blockquote class=\"Pullquote\"> <p>Learning and evaluation are most helpful when the questions are clear, and everyone understands what we’ll do with the answers.</p> </blockquote>\n<h4>8. You lived in Boston before, but have been away for 18 years. What have you noticed?</h4>\n<p>When I last lived here, the Big Dig was in full swing, so it’s amazing to see the positive changes, particularly in the North End. I used to live in Roxbury, and the development has been dramatic – I hardly recognize my former neighborhood. I love the diversity of the city, and that it continues to evolve with new waves of immigrants. Although some neighborhoods have changed, the multicultural character of the city and its deep sense of history are still its defining characteristics. </p>\n"

      "Title": "Giving that Considers All Costs",
      "Field2": "\n\n<p>On this #GivingTuesday, we’re all invited to reflect on how best to support the causes we care about. Now in its sixth year, #GivingTuesday has become, in the words of its organizers, “a global day of giving fueled by social media and collaboration” and a “kickoff to the charitable season.” </p>\n<p>At the Barr Foundation, we have the privilege of working in a sector where it is always the charitable season. Yet, our ability to reach our goals is likewise fueled by collaboration.

GuideStar, BBB Wise Giving Alliance, and Charity Navigator launched the <a href=\"http://overheadmyth.com/\">Overhead Myth campaign</a> in 2013, building on a theme that many have spoken to for years. In 2016, the Nonprofit Finance Fund’s <a href=\"http://www.nonprofitfinancefund.org/story/full-costs-social-sector\">Full Cost Project</a> outlined a sophisticated, six-component model of the types of resources nonprofits require to deliver outcomes. And the Ford Foundation and The Bridgespan Group recently <a href=\"https://ssir.org/articles/entry/time_to_reboot_grantmaking\">shared a three-tiered pyramid</a> illustrating a hierarchy of needs that now guides Ford’s grantmaking and other efforts to build “successful, resilient organizations.”   </p>\n<div class=\"Media -aside -left\"> <div class=\"Media-imageWrapper\"> <img alt=\"Full Funding Circle\" class=\"Media-image\" src=\"https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1968/crop_preview.png?1642121622\"/> <div class=\"FancyAttribution\"> <p><a class=\"FancyAttribution-link\" href=\"http://fullcostproject.org/fullcosts\">Full Cost Project</a></p> </div> </div> </div> <div class=\"Media -aside -left\"> <div class=\"Media-imageWrapper\"> <img alt=\"Full Funding Pyramid\" class=\"Media-image\" src=\"https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1969/crop_preview.png?1642121625\"/> <div class=\"FancyAttribution\"> <p><a class=\"FancyAttribution-link\" href=\"https://ssir.org/articles/entry/time_to_reboot_grantmaking\">The Ford Foundation and The Bridgespan Group</a></p> </div> </div> </div>\n<p>While any one model may not apply to all nonprofit organizations, each of these frameworks encourage more comprehensive dialogue between funders and grantees about the real costs of pursuing shared objectives.    </p>\n<h4>Reflection, Reassessment, and Guiding Principles</h4>\n<p>For us at Barr, consideration of these frameworks has prompted us to reexamine our own practices. Accordingly, through recent team discussions, we clarified three guiding principles for how we approach financial conversations with our nonprofit partners:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Understand and pay for embedded costs</strong> </p>\n<p>For organizations to be effective, they need to operate from a position of financial strength. As funders, one of the more important roles we can play toward that end is to understand the full costs incurred by organizations when we support them and to structure our grants in ways that address those embedded costs, build organizational strength, and encourage attention to the financial health of our partners.</p>\n<p>While Barr does provide unrestricted support to some organizations, the majority of our grants support projects. In those instances, we need to ensure we cover all costs associated with those discrete projects and remain attentive to organizations’ holistic needs so they can achieve optimal impact. As we express this commitment, we will have to balance how best to achieve this aspiration within our own grants budget constraints.</p>\n<p>As one illustration of this, during <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/barr-renews-commitment-to-signature-leadership-program\">our recent review of the Barr Fellowship</a>, we realized that the grant dollars we awarded to Fellows’ organizations did not reflect the full costs of leaders’ participation in the program. This is why we significantly increased the size of those grants.  </p>\n<blockquote class=\"Pullquote\"> <p>For organizations to be effective, they need to operate from a position of financial strength.</p> </blockquote>\n<p><strong>2. Listen carefully and remain flexible</strong><br/>\nPolicies and guidelines are helpful, but they can go only so far. Given Barr’s program areas, grantees range from arts institutions to community-based organizations, to large coalitions, to public school systems. Each has distinct needs and financial structures. As a result, there are no one-size-fits-all approaches when we determine how to structure our grants; instead, we need to take time to understand each organization’s context and to stay nimble in working with our partners.</p>\n<p>Five years ago, following feedback from our 2012 Grantee Perception Report and subsequent focus groups, Barr stopped setting a strict 15% cap on indirect costs for project funding. Instead, we began taking a more flexible approach. Guided by the simple proposition that our partners know best what they need, we examine each organization’s circumstances. We still ask questions and sometimes offer suggestions. Yet, these conversations are rooted in respect for the knowledge and perspective that our partners bring to the work they do. On our end, we strive to meet partners where they are and to invest resources for the work at hand.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"Pullquote\"> <p>There are no one-size-fits-all approaches. Instead, we need to take time to understand each organization’s context.</p> </blockquote>\n<p><strong>3. Foster open, two-way dialogue</strong><br/>\nThe principles articulated above can only work when there is open, candid dialogue and constructive conversation between the Foundation and its partners. This necessity is, of course, not limited to discussions about finances, but because discussion of dollars can be so fraught, that spirit is even more paramount in those exchanges. </p>\n<p>We also need to explore how our practices and processes—often in the name of consistency or efficiency—can at times impede effective communications. For example, the blanket use of preordained budget templates by funders can actually mask rather than reveal the full financial picture and management capacity. Such templates can be important tools, but only so far as they help to inform ongoing discussion. If we are to be successful in overcoming these challenges, we must view funders and grantees as equal partners in pursuing impact. Doing so requires that our communications be grounded in candor and open dialogue.</p>\n<h4>Principles in Action</h4>\n<p>We outline these principles for reasons beyond transparency: we want to be held accountable to living out these principles in our work.</p>\n<p>Complacency is the enemy of excellence. This is particularly true in philanthropy, where there are few external forces that hold us accountable. In our view, the best foundations seek ongoing improvement and are committed to learning how they can be better. It is in that spirit that we ask our partners: when we fall short of demonstrating these principles in action, please tell us. When we don’t live up to our aspirations, please help us to do so. And when we do honor these principles in our work with you, please let us know that too, so we can also learn from what works well.</p>\n<p>To work in philanthropy is a privilege. We have opportunities every day to invest resources in talented leaders and organizations making a difference on some of society’s biggest challenges. To do our work well, we aspire to responsible grantmaking in which all costs are calibrated appropriately to the desired impact, flexibility is an inherent dimension of the relationship, mutual respect and constructive dialogue animates the partnership, and the Foundation is held accountable as much as we hold others accountable.  </p>\n"

Whatever methods we use to communicate, we will use barrfoundation.org to curate and link to the many conversations in which we are actively engaged.</p>\n<p>My thanks to the many partners we engaged last fall to help us define the online experience we want visitors to have of the Barr Foundation; to my ace Communications team and Barr Foundation colleagues for all their work to keep our eyes on that goal (even as record-setting snows buried Boston); and to <a href=\"https://www.threespot.com/\">Threespot</a>, our terrific design and digital partner.</p>\n<p>So again, welcome. Show yourself around. I hope you enjoy your visit.</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:feedback@barrfoundation.org?subject=Barr's%20New%20Website\">Please let us know what you think.</a> </p>\n"

In this role, Mary will drive the Foundation's emerging digital media strategy and expand the communications capacity for Barr's program teams, as well as select grantees and initiatives. Mary most recently served as senior communications analyst at the <a href=\"http://www.icic.org\">Initiative for a Competitive Inner City</a> and will join us in mid-December.</p>\n<p>I am also delighted to announce the promotion of <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/jaime-lopez\">Jaime Lopez</a> to office manager. Nearly anyone who has visited Barr since Jaime joined us in 2008 has been warmly received by our kind, gracious, and eminently professional receptionist and office assistant, who has been the organizing force behind the scenes of so many of Barr's day-to-day operations, meetings, and events. In his new role, Jaime will continue to receive our guests at the front desk but will also work more closely with the Operations team on a variety of special projects.</p>\n<p>We also have a search still underway for a new <a href=\"http://www.barrfoundation.org/news/the-barr-foundation-seeks-director-of-education\">Director of Education</a>, and as we continue to fill these vacancies I look forward to sharing updates with you.

      "Title": "10 Questions with Silvia López Chavez",
      "Field2": "\n\n<h4>Cecilia: How did you discover your passion for art?</h4>\n<p><strong>Sylvia:</strong> I have wanted to be an artist since I was very young. I am lucky to have a family who supported that vision. There are a lot of creative people in my life in general. I grew up with parents that loved music, played instruments, and were part of a band when they were young. </p>\n<h4>Cecilia: What does the name “Rhythmic Nimbleness” mean?</h4>\n<p><strong>Sylvia:</strong> I came across so much information on the Barr Foundation through research and discussions with staff. The word “nimble” stuck out to me. Then, as I was creating the patterns throughout the room, the “rhythm” of movement became apparent. The rhythm switches and changes, but it’s all interconnected. This piece is like music.  </p>\n<p><strong>Time lapse: Watch as Silvia Lopez Chavez creates \"Rhythmic Nimbleness\":</strong></p>\n<div class=\"Media -full\"> <div class=\"u-fluid-iframe\"> <div class=\"u-fluid-iframe-inner\"> <iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" data-ready=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/284980380?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0\" title=\"Video: “Rhythmic Nimbleness” Timelapse | Silvia Lopez Chavez\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\"> <a href=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/284980380?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0\">A video on Vimeo</a> </iframe> </div> </div> </div>\n<h4>Cecilia: How do you create a mural like this?</h4>\n<p><strong>Sylvia:</strong> I’m a big planner. As a graphic designer, my toolkit has both an analog and digital life. I’ll sketch in my sketchbook, but I also work on my laptop in Illustrator to create shapes. </p>\n<p>Murals tend to be big, so I usually work with a team. I am passionate about supporting other female artists who want to do this work. We have a plan each day, each person has a guide to work through, and we set goals to accomplish.   </p>\n<h4>Cecilia: What is the story of this mural?</h4>\n<p><strong>Sylvia:</strong> I started by researching Barr, its work, the neighborhood, and the history of the organization. I explored the space where I would be creating: how is this room used and what happens in that space? How does light affect the space and what surrounds it?  </p>\n<p>Then, I met with Barr staff members to share ideas and incorporate their experience. The imagery of water and this idea of translucence, transparency and inter-connectedness really struck me. Whether it was a small drop of water or a big wave that created a giant ripple, water connects throughout. To create a more contemporary feel, I used abstract shapes in a variety of directions and tones to look like rivers, oceans, or rain.</p>\n<h4>Cecilia: What is it like to work with non-artists in a creative process?</h4>\n<p><strong>Sylvia:</strong> In my practice as an artist, I do a lot of community-oriented work. I love working in untraditional places, like with patients at Boston Children's Hospital, or on community art projects. It excites me to work with people who might not consider themselves artists and see them start to realize just how creative they are. Barr staff provided feedback throughout and helped me simplify. It was great to co-create in this way. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"Pullquote\"> <p>It excites me to work with people who might not consider themselves artists and see them start to realize just how creative they are.</p> </blockquote>\n<div class=\"Media -full -right\"> <div class=\"Media-imageWrapper\"> <img alt=\"A picture of a new mural on office walls. \" class=\"Media-image\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px\" src=\"https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2616/small.jpg?1642124020\" srcset=\"https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2616/small.jpg?1642124020 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2616/medium.jpg?1642124020 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2616/large.jpg?1642124020 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2616/x_large.jpg?1642124020 1600w\"/> <div class=\"FancyAttribution\"> <p>Photo courtesy of the artist</p> </div> </div> </div>\n<h4>Cecilia: Tell us about your art background. What attracted you, as an artist, to the Boston area?</h4>\n<p><strong>Sylvia:</strong> I went to an art school in the Dominican Republic and I did a four-year program, with two years in the Dominican Republic and two years at the Parsons School of Design. A friend of mine had moved to Boston and recommended MassArt. After some research, I decided to come to Boston for art school.  </p>\n<p>I didn’t really know how cold it was going to be! I came for school, and, in the beginning, I was determined to move back. I have dual citizenship, which made it easier to have a choice.   </p>\n<p>In my senior year, I interned at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. I was offered a full-time job and it was just such a great opportunity to grow within the organization. The longer you stay here, the easier it becomes.   </p>\n<h4>Cecilia: From your perspective, how has public art in the greater Boston area changed since you started working here?</h4>\n<p><strong>Sylvia:</strong> It's been challenging to get public art to take off here. The process is cumbersome, but I am hopeful. We are taking steps in the right direction. Now the City has an artists' desk to help artists navigate City Hall, permitting, and other challenges. People are hungry for these interactions with art in all levels, music, performance, theater, visual.</p>\n<iframe allow=\"autoplay\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/485894040&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true&amp;visual=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n<h4>Cecilia: What is your ideal canvas to work on in Boston?</h4>\n<p><strong>Sylvia:</strong> I don’t have a specific spot, but there are so many buildings that are completely blank. In the South End, you’ll have this beautiful park and then there’s nothing. Instead of seeing blank space, wouldn’t it be cool to create something beautiful and unexpected? It's like a surprise. </p>\n<h4>Cecilia: Where else can people see your work?</h4>\n<p><strong>Sylvia:</strong> My current mural is in Brookline at the corner of St. Paul and Dummer Street. It's a mural commissioned by the Brooklyn Art Center. And I have one at <a href=\"https://news.northeastern.edu/2018/05/15/whos-the-artist-behind-that-giant-pair-of-hands-holding-a-paper-crane-outside-ruggles-station/\">Northeastern University’s Centennial Park</a>. Last summer, I created a mural, curated by Now + There, on the bike path of the <a href=\"http://www.nowandthere.org/blog/2017/8/15/new-contemporaryart-for-the-charles-river-esplanade\">Charles River Esplanade</a>. I have a mural inside the new <a href=\"https://www.honeygrow.com/blog/mon-07162018-0936/visual-rhythm-silvia-l%C3%B3pez-chavez\">Honeygrow restaurant</a> on Summer Street. I'm currently working on a community mural in downtown Chelsea, commissioned by GreenRoots, Inc. and I'll be back at Barr in the fall working in Pilot House.\n </p>\n<h4>Cecilia: Is there anything else you'd like us to know?</h4>\n<p><strong>Sylvia:</strong> It’s so important to support the work of artists and art in Boston. Artists continue to leave the city because of the lack of opportunities and how difficult it is to make a living. Efforts for more workspace and affordable housing can go a long way in creating an ecosystem that supports local artists. \nPublic art brings people together.  We can lead by example by creating more supportive infrastructure here in Boston.  Let’s work together to keep artists, our neighbors, and our friends in the community. </p>\n"

      "Title": "A Time for Aspiration",
      "Field2": "\n\n<p>In this final week of January, hundreds of thousands of our hardworking friends, neighbors, and colleagues can finally count on a Friday paycheck. For more than a month, the government shutdown compromised the lives and livelihoods of our fellow citizens.  Born out of antipathy to immigrants and refugees, this unnecessary episode has offered yet another potent reminder of the importance of remaining grounded in the challenging realities that so many people face today.</p>\n<p>For us at the Barr Foundation, we have embarked on a new year of grantmaking – informed by reflections on learning and progress to date (as highlighted in our <a href=\"http://2018.barrfoundation.org/\">2018 Year in Review)</a>, guided by our long-term goals, and responsive to new opportunities that are emerging to advance ambitious priorities in this new year. </p>\n<p>Of course, our work occurs in a larger context with which we all contend: a country riven by political, cultural, and economic divides; a time when the rights of many—hard-earned over generations of struggle and courageous leadership—are being stripped away; and a region facing massive challenges that include crumbling infrastructure, the persistent threat of climate change, and educational systems that leave far too many of our young people behind. </p>\n<p>To address these challenges head-on in 2019, one word has come into focus as our guiding principle – <strong>aspiration</strong>. Indeed, where new hope, energy, and bold leadership are already evident, we see them animated, unified, and inspired by a spirit of aspiration, and by a positive, forward-looking vision. At Barr, we consider it an imperative to embrace and push for aspiration in all that we do - as my colleague, Mary Skelton Roberts, did in her recent blog post,  “<a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/time-transform-transportation-massachusetts\">It's Time to Transform Transportation in Massachusetts.</a>”  </p>\n<p>Soon after publishing this post, Jim had the opportunity to speak on the theme of aspiration as it relates to the future of Boston, at an event to launch <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/inside/2019/02/20/wbur-cityspace-at-the-lavine-broadcast-center-debuts-february-28-with-free-grand-opening\">CitySpace</a>, WBUR’s new venue for civic discourse:</p>\n<div class=\"Media -full\"> <div class=\"u-fluid-iframe\"> <div class=\"u-fluid-iframe-inner\"> <iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" data-ready=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/320262951?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0\" title=\"Video: Jim Canales on Making Boston a City of Aspiration\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\"> <a href=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/320262951?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0\">A video on Vimeo</a> </iframe> </div> </div> </div>\n<p>For more on this event, “What’s Our Aspiration? Moving Boston Forward,” <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/bold-aspirations-for-boston-future\">click here</a>.</p>\n<p>Originally defined in the 1600s as a “steadfast longing for a higher goal,” aspiration remains a worthy pursuit for philanthropy. We are endowed with significant resources. Free from the constraints of the ballot box or bottom line, we can take a long-term view and embrace risk in ways that many others cannot. Perhaps most significantly, we can access and partner with many of the world’s most talented leaders and effective institutions on the front lines of social change. For all these reasons, philanthropy has both the opportunity and obligation to push for greater ambition and bolder action.</p>\n<p>To advance our aspirations this year, the Barr Foundation intends to devote more resources than ever. Our 2019 grantmaking budget will be $90 million, representing the fifth consecutive year of growth in our grants budget and the largest grants allocation in Barr’s history. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"Pullquote\"> <p>To advance our aspirations this year, the Barr Foundation intends to devote more resources than ever with the largest grants allocation in Barr’s history.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>We couple this grantmaking growth with expanded staff capacity, as we welcome: <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/prerna-sekhri\">Prerna Sekhri</a> as our new manager of program operations; <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/john-dello-russo\">John Dello Russo</a> as program assistant for Sector Effectiveness, and; <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/maia-white\">Maia White</a> as office assistant and receptionist. We have also expanded our grants management team with <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/maryam-hamedany\">Maryam Hamedany</a> transitioning to her new role as grants associate.

      "Title": "Barr Awards $25.8 Million in Third Quarter of 2018",
      "Field2": "\n\n<p>At its third board meeting of 2018, the Barr Foundation Board of Trustees approved grants totaling $18.6 million, in addition to $7.2 million approved since the June board meeting. We are pleased to highlight several new and continuing partnerships below. </p>\n<p>In <strong>Arts &amp; Creativity</strong>, Barr awarded thirty-five grants totaling nearly $6 million. A $200,000 grant for <a href=\"https://www.beyond-walls.org/\">Beyond Walls</a> (fiscal sponsor is Neighborhood Development Associates) supported the second Beyond Walls Mural Festival of public art in downtown Lynn, which featured large-scale murals by international and local artists and street art such as sidewalk sculptures and storefront enhancements. To help grow the festival’s audience reach, Beyond Walls experimented with new collaborations to encourage community participation. The Mural Festival has attracted <a href=\"http://www.wbur.org/artery/2018/08/24/beyond-walls-mural-festival-lynn-2018\">new foot traffic and commerce to Lynn’s downtown</a>, demonstrating how the arts can lead community revitalization efforts. Barr also awarded twenty-nine grants totaling $4.8 million for a new initiative to be formally announced next week.</p>\n<p>In <strong>Climate</strong>, Barr awarded seventeen grants totaling $10.5 million. In Clean Energy, a $1 million grant to <a href=\"https://www.ceres.org/\">Ceres, Inc.</a> will continue its work to support regional and national business leadership on clean energy and climate mitigation. In Mobility, a $2.4 million grant to <a href=\"https://www.clf.org/\">Conservation Law Foundation, Inc.</a> (CLF) will further its clean energy, mobility, and resilience efforts by advancing climate-smart policies and practices in New England.  A $2 million grant to the <a href=\"https://www.mapc.org/\">Metropolitan Area Planning Council</a> (MAPC) will support MAPC’s Regional Plan Update, which is its long-range regional planning process for 101 cities and towns in Greater Boston. The plan will lay out a vision for the future, set goals and objectives to assess whether the region is moving in that direction, and implement strategies to inform policy and development decisions. In Resilience, a $400,000 grant to MAPC will support a new mini-grant program to advance climate resilience efforts in municipalities across Metro Boston. MAPC will provide resources and technical assistance to local towns and cities so they can enhance their preparedness and responsiveness to climate change. </p>\n<p>In <strong>Education</strong>, Barr awarded sixteen grants totaling $4.4 million. Earlier this year, the Education team announced a new RFP, <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/partners/planning-for-success-rfp\">Planning for Post-Secondary Success for All Students</a>, inviting New England schools to join a cohort to conduct comprehensive analyses of their high school student populations. The following districts have each been awarded $150,000:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hartfordschools.org/\">Hartford Public Schools</a> in Hartford, Connecticut</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://maldenps.org/\">Malden Public Schools</a> in Malden, Massachusetts</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.mansd.org/\">Manchester School District</a> in Manchester, New Hampshire</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.portlandschools.org/\">Portland Public Schools</a> in Portland, Maine</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://worcesterschools.org/\">Worcester Public Schools</a> in Worcester, Massachusetts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These districts are committed to addressing findings and making the changes necessary to meet the needs and assets of their students. The insights generated from this analysis and the support of cohort members will help these schools articulate a vision and action steps to prepare all students for success in college, career, and the community.</p>\n<p>In <strong>Sector Effectiveness</strong>, Barr awarded three grants totaling $580,000. A $175,000 grant to <a href=\"https://boardsource.org/\">BoardSource</a> will support research, convenings, and communications efforts to spur positive change in foundation board behavior and makeup. For thirty years, BoardSource has been a key support for nonprofit boards. It is now in the process of adapting its resources for the unique needs of foundation boards. A $225,000 grant to <a href=\"http://fundthepeople.org/\">Fund the People</a> (fiscal sponsor is Community Partners) will provide core support for continued research, resources, and communications to encourage further development and talent-investment in the nonprofit workforce. A significant component of the proposed work is the launch of a new initiative, Equity in Nonprofit Work, which will produce resources intended to empower people of color and other historically marginalized people to access nonprofit work, advance and sustain nonprofit careers, and ascend to nonprofit leadership.</p>\n<div class=\"DoughnutChart\"> <div class=\"DoughnutChart-row\"> <div class=\"DoughnutChart-chartWrapper DoughnutChart-row-col\"><div class=\"chartjs-size-monitor\"><div class=\"chartjs-size-monitor-expand\"><div class=\"\"></div></div><div class=\"chartjs-size-monitor-shrink\"><div class=\"\"></div></div></div> <canvas class=\"DoughnutChart-chart chartjs-render-monitor\" data-config='[{\"id\":58,\"label\":\"Sector Effectiveness\",\"piece_type\":null,\"color\":\"#0a3074\",\"amount\":580000,\"display_amount\":\"$580,000\",\"description\":\"In Sector Effectiveness, Barr awarded three grants totaling $580,000.\",\"cta_text_primary\":\"View all Sector Effectiveness grants\",\"cta_uri_primary\":\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/grantmaking/grants?query=\\u0026program_areas%5B%5D=sector_effectiveness#Grants\",\"cta_text_secondary\":null,\"cta_uri_secondary\":null,\"weight\":2,\"sliceable_id\":38,\"sliceable_type\":\"DoughnutChart\",\"created_at\":\"2018-09-21T15:57:11.650Z\",\"updated_at\":\"2018-09-21T18:26:59.799Z\",\"heading\":\"\"},{\"id\":59,\"label\":\"Education\",\"piece_type\":null,\"color\":\"#ee2737\",\"amount\":4400000,\"display_amount\":\"$4,400,000\",\"description\":\"In Education, Barr awarded sixteen grants totaling nearly $4.4 million.\",\"cta_text_primary\":\"View all Education grants\",\"cta_uri_primary\":\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/grantmaking/grants?query=\\u0026program_areas%5B%5D=climate\\u0026program_areas%5B%5D=education#Grants\",\"cta_text_secondary\":null,\"cta_uri_secondary\":null,\"weight\":4,\"sliceable_id\":38,\"sliceable_type\":\"DoughnutChart\",\"created_at\":\"2018-09-21T18:26:59.802Z\",\"updated_at\":\"2018-09-21T18:26:59.802Z\",\"heading\":\"\"},{\"id\":60,\"label\":\"Climate\",\"piece_type\":null,\"color\":\"#f2a900\",\"amount\":10500000,\"display_amount\":\"$10,500,000\",\"description\":\"In Climate, Barr awarded seventeen grants totaling nearly $10.5 million.\",\"cta_text_primary\":\"View all Climate grants\",\"cta_uri_primary\":\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/grantmaking/grants?query=\\u0026program_areas%5B%5D=climate#Grants\",\"cta_text_secondary\":null,\"cta_uri_secondary\":null,\"weight\":6,\"sliceable_id\":38,\"sliceable_type\":\"DoughnutChart\",\"created_at\":\"2018-09-21T18:26:59.813Z\",\"updated_at\":\"2018-09-21T21:13:13.799Z\",\"heading\":\"\"},{\"id\":61,\"label\":\"Other\",\"piece_type\":null,\"color\":\"#0081c6\",\"amount\":173400,\"display_amount\":\"$173,400\",\"description\":\"This category includes organizational development grants, dues for Memberships \\u0026 Sponsorships, and employee gift matching.\",\"cta_text_primary\":\"\",\"cta_uri_primary\":\"\",\"cta_text_secondary\":null,\"cta_uri_secondary\":null,\"weight\":8,\"sliceable_id\":38,\"sliceable_type\":\"DoughnutChart\",\"created_at\":\"2018-09-21T18:26:59.821Z\",\"updated_at\":\"2018-09-21T18:45:05.922Z\",\"heading\":\"\"},{\"id\":62,\"label\":\"Arts \\u0026 Creativity\",\"piece_type\":null,\"color\":\"#0a3074\",\"amount\":6000000,\"display_amount\":\"$6,000,000\",\"description\":\"In Arts \\u0026 Creativity, Barr awarded thirty-five grants totaling nearly $6 million.\",\"cta_text_primary\":\"View all Arts \\u0026 Creativity grants\",\"cta_uri_primary\":\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/grantmaking/grants?query=\\u0026program_areas%5B%5D=arts_creativity#Grants\",\"cta_text_secondary\":null,\"cta_uri_secondary\":null,\"weight\":10,\"sliceable_id\":38,\"sliceable_type\":\"DoughnutChart\",\"created_at\":\"2018-09-21T18:26:59.829Z\",\"updated_at\":\"2018-09-21T21:13:13.805Z\",\"heading\":\"\"},{\"id\":63,\"label\":\"Special Initiatives\",\"piece_type\":null,\"color\":\"#33cc99\",\"amount\":4200000,\"display_amount\":\"$4,200,000\",\"description\":\"In Special Initiatives, Barr awarded twenty-eight grants totaling $4.2 million.\",\"cta_text_primary\":\"View all Special Initiatives grants\",\"cta_uri_primary\":\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/special-initiatives/strengthening-civil-rights-and-democracy#grantmaking\",\"cta_text_secondary\":null,\"cta_uri_secondary\":null,\"weight\":12,\"sliceable_id\":38,\"sliceable_type\":\"DoughnutChart\",\"created_at\":\"2018-09-21T18:26:59.837Z\",\"updated_at\":\"2018-09-21T21:13:13.812Z\",\"heading\":\"\"}]' height=\"600\" style=\"display: block;

      "Title": "Investing Resources and Offering Flexibility",
      "Field2": "\n\n<p>In my <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/a-message-to-our-grantees-on-covid-19\">previous post</a>, I outlined Barr’s shift to remote operations, new flexibilities we were immediately offering our current partners, and our commitment, at a minimum, to sustain our grantmaking at $95 million for 2020. </p>\n<p>Today, we are announcing grants of $2.6 million for emergency response and outlining ways in which we are adapting our work to offer greater flexibility to our partners.</p>\n<h3>COVID-19 Emergency Response</h3>\n<p>We are committed to ensuring resources are available in communities across the Commonwealth, given the enormous needs the crisis is creating in our home state. In an effort to get resources to work as quickly as possible, we have decided to partner with a set of community foundations across Massachusetts, given the in-depth knowledge they possess about their local communities. We believe the leaders working in greatest proximity to communities deserve our trust, support, and investment.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"Pullquote\"> <p>We believe the leaders working in greatest proximity to communities deserve our trust, support, and investment.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>We are fortunate that, through our Arts &amp; Creativity program, Barr has already built a deep partnership with five community foundations – investing significant resources in them through the <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/arts-creativity/creative-commonwealth\">Creative Commonwealth initiative</a>. We will be providing additional support to these five partners, and will also invest in six additional Massachusetts community foundations to ensure that resources are available in other parts of the state.</p>\n<p>All of these grants will support the respective emergency response funds established by each of these community foundations. Many have already begun to award grants for urgent community needs, and Barr’s grant will enable them to broaden this support.</p>\n<p>Barr has committed $250,000 to each of our Creative Commonwealth partners:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Community Foundation of Southeastern Massachusetts</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Community Foundation of Western Massachusetts</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Berkshire Taconic Community Foundation</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Essex County Community Foundation</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Greater Worcester Community Foundation</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, Barr has committed $100,000 to each of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Cape Cod Foundation</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Community Foundation of North Central Massachusetts</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Greater Lowell Community Foundation</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Foundation for MetroWest</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Community Foundation for Nantucket</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Permanent Endowment for Martha’s Vineyard</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>While the bulk of these grants focus outside of Boston, we have also awarded a $500,000 grant to the <a href=\"https://www.boston.gov/departments/treasury/boston-resiliency-fund\">Boston Resiliency Fund</a>, established by Boston Mayor Marty Walsh earlier this month. This fund focuses on providing food for Boston’s children and seniors, technology for Boston Public School students, and support for first responders and health care workers to do their critical jobs. In its first 10 days, the Fund exceeded its goal of $20 million, with over 1,800 donations – with more coming in every day. The fund has already allocated over $5 million in grants. </p>\n<p>And Barr has also committed $250,000 to the Boston Foundation’s <a href=\"https://www.tbf.org/what-we-do/special-funds/covid-19-response-fund\">COVID-19 Response Fund</a>, which is providing general operating support grants to organizations addressing the basic needs of vulnerable populations during the pandemic. </p>\n<p>As we engage in grantmaking we had not planned for this year, we remain committed to our existing partners, and to Barr’s core programs of Arts &amp; Creativity, Climate, and Education. The bulk of our resources will remain dedicated to these partnerships. Yet, we know that the content and focus of this support will need to adapt and be informed by how our partners are experiencing and responding to the pandemic. </p>\n<h3>Greater Flexibility</h3>\n<p>We also realize that many of our current grantees are facing a changed landscape for their work. Accordingly, for these partners, our trustees have authorized program staff to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Convert restricted or project-based grants to general operating support, based on organizational circumstances. </li>\n<li>Waive contingencies and alter other terms of grants as helpful in this new environment.</li>\n<li>Modify reporting requirements and methods and – where appropriate – waive them entirely. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Over the past few weeks, my colleagues have been in direct contact with our grantees, to understand their needs and to share these decisions. We will continue to reach out proactively, but you should also feel free to reach out to us, if exploring these options would be helpful at this time.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"Pullquote\"> <p>We will continue to reach out proactively, but you should also feel free to reach out to us.</p> </blockquote>\n<h3>Streamlining Proposal Review</h3>\n<p>For organizations that are (or will be) in active discussions with Barr’s program staff about grant proposals, our team is working to implement a much-streamlined process for developing, reviewing, and approving them. Our aim is to reduce the work required of our partners at this time, while also accelerating the review and approval time on our end. We want to move as swiftly as we can in response to urgent needs in this challenging time.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Barr Foundation Board of Trustees approved grants totaling nearly $19 million, in addition to $5.5 million approved since our December board meeting. In light of the COVID-19 crisis, we are not issuing our typical grants announcement. You can, however, learn more about these grants via the chart below, or by visiting our <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/grantmaking/grants\">Grants Database</a>. Each of these partners is contending with challenges few of us could have anticipated only months ago. </p>\n<p>These are challenging times. We know that the news over the next few weeks, in particular, will be difficult, but we also know that we will emerge from this. We at Barr are so very grateful to our partners who are dealing with extraordinary circumstances right now and doing so with commitment, determination, and grace. We aim to emulate the same, and I will continue to update you here on decisions we are making to ensure we step up to these times.</p>\n<div class=\"DoughnutChart\"> <div class=\"DoughnutChart-row\"> <div class=\"DoughnutChart-chartWrapper DoughnutChart-row-col\"><div class=\"chartjs-size-monitor\"><div class=\"chartjs-size-monitor-expand\"><div class=\"\"></div></div><div class=\"chartjs-size-monitor-shrink\"><div class=\"\"></div></div></div> <canvas class=\"DoughnutChart-chart chartjs-render-monitor\" data-config='[{\"id\":95,\"label\":\"Sector Effectiveness\",\"piece_type\":null,\"color\":\"#33cc99\",\"amount\":1500000,\"display_amount\":\"$1,500,000\",\"description\":\"In Sector Effectiveness, Barr awarded two grants totaling $1,500,000.\",\"cta_text_primary\":\"View all Sector Effectiveness grants\",\"cta_uri_primary\":\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/grantmaking/grants?query=\\u0026program_areas%5B%5D=sector_effectiveness#Grants\",\"cta_text_secondary\":null,\"cta_uri_secondary\":null,\"weight\":2,\"sliceable_id\":44,\"sliceable_type\":\"DoughnutChart\",\"created_at\":\"2020-03-31T20:22:22.323Z\",\"updated_at\":\"2020-03-31T20:22:22.323Z\",\"heading\":\"\"},{\"id\":96,\"label\":\"Education\",\"piece_type\":null,\"color\":\"#0a3074 \",\"amount\":8100000,\"display_amount\":\"$8,100,000\",\"description\":\"In Education, Barr awarded twelve grants totaling $8.1 million.\",\"cta_text_primary\":\"View all Education grants\",\"cta_uri_primary\":\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/grantmaking/grants?query=\\u0026program_areas%5B%5D=climate\\u0026program_areas%5B%5D=education#Grants\",\"cta_text_secondary\":null,\"cta_uri_secondary\":null,\"weight\":4,\"sliceable_id\":44,\"sliceable_type\":\"DoughnutChart\",\"created_at\":\"2020-03-31T20:22:22.364Z\",\"updated_at\":\"2020-03-31T20:22:22.364Z\",\"heading\":\"\"},{\"id\":97,\"label\":\"Climate\",\"piece_type\":null,\"color\":\"#f2a900\",\"amount\":10800000,\"display_amount\":\"$10,800,000\",\"description\":\"In Climate, Barr awarded twenty-five grants totaling $10.8 million.\",\"cta_text_primary\":\"View all Climate grants\",\"cta_uri_primary\":\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/grantmaking/grants?query=\\u0026program_areas%5B%5D=climate#Grants\",\"cta_text_secondary\":null,\"cta_uri_secondary\":null,\"weight\":6,\"sliceable_id\":44,\"sliceable_type\":\"DoughnutChart\",\"created_at\":\"2020-03-31T20:22:22.440Z\",\"updated_at\":\"2020-03-31T20:22:22.440Z\",\"heading\":\"\"},{\"id\":98,\"label\":\"Other\",\"piece_type\":null,\"color\":\"#ee2737 \",\"amount\":500000,\"display_amount\":\"$500,000\",\"description\":\"This category includes organizational development grants, dues for Memberships \\u0026 Sponsorships, and employee gift matching.\",\"cta_text_primary\":\"\",\"cta_uri_primary\":\"\",\"cta_text_secondary\":null,\"cta_uri_secondary\":null,\"weight\":8,\"sliceable_id\":44,\"sliceable_type\":\"DoughnutChart\",\"created_at\":\"2020-03-31T20:22:22.480Z\",\"updated_at\":\"2020-03-31T20:22:22.480Z\",\"heading\":\"\"},{\"id\":99,\"label\":\"Arts \\u0026 Creativity\",\"piece_type\":null,\"color\":\"#0081c6\",\"amount\":2600000,\"display_amount\":\"$2,600,000\",\"description\":\"In Arts \\u0026 Creativity, Barr awarded five grants totaling over $2.6 million.\",\"cta_text_primary\":\"View all Arts \\u0026 Creativity grants\",\"cta_uri_primary\":\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/grantmaking/grants?query=\\u0026program_areas%5B%5D=arts_creativity#Grants\",\"cta_text_secondary\":null,\"cta_uri_secondary\":null,\"weight\":10,\"sliceable_id\":44,\"sliceable_type\":\"DoughnutChart\",\"created_at\":\"2020-03-31T20:22:22.556Z\",\"updated_at\":\"2020-03-31T20:22:22.556Z\",\"heading\":\"\"},{\"id\":100,\"label\":\"Special Initiatives\",\"piece_type\":null,\"color\":\"#f1d934\",\"amount\":1000000,\"display_amount\":\"$1,000,000\",\"description\":\"Through its Special Initiatives program, Barr awarded two grants totaling $1 million.\",\"cta_text_primary\":\"View all Special Initiative grants\",\"cta_uri_primary\":\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/grantmaking/grants?query=\\u0026program_areas%5B%5D=special_initiatives#Grants\",\"cta_text_secondary\":null,\"cta_uri_secondary\":null,\"weight\":12,\"sliceable_id\":44,\"sliceable_type\":\"DoughnutChart\",\"created_at\":\"2020-03-31T20:22:22.605Z\",\"updated_at\":\"2020-03-31T20:22:22.605Z\",\"heading\":\"\"}]' height=\"600\" style=\"display: block;

To open the evening, Barr Foundation co-founder and board chair Barbara Hostetter briefly shared her journey in creating the foundation, and the vision that she and Amos Hostetter had for the foundation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>When Amos and I were starting the Barr Foundation, from the earliest strategic planning moments we felt strongly about the kind of partner we hoped Barr would be.  We wanted the nonprofit leaders who we worked with to have stellar experiences. We wanted the relationships and exchanges – whether organizations were awarded a grant or not – to be constructive, positive, respectful and valuable.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a class=\"button -medium -no-arrow\" data-track=\"{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;event&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;Button&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;Read Barbara's full remarks&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/296/attachments/BWH_giving_done_right_remarks.pdf?1557241526&quot;}\" href=\"https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/296/attachments/BWH_giving_done_right_remarks.pdf?1557241526\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Read Barbara's full remarks<svg class=\"Icon\" height=\"48\" viewbox=\"0 0 48 48\" width=\"48\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M31.4,37.6l-4.7,4.7V21.5c0-0.8-0.6-1.4-1.4-1.4c-0.8,0-1.4,0.6-1.4,1.4v20.9l-4.7-4.7 c-0.6-0.6-1.5-0.6-2,0c-0.6,0.6-0.6,1.5,0,2l7.1,7.1c0.3,0.3,0.6,0.4,1,0.4c0.4,0,0.7-0.2,1-0.4l7.2-7.1c0.6-0.6,0.6-1.5,0-2 C32.8,37,31.9,37,31.4,37.6z\"></path> <path d=\"M38.7,11.8C38.7,11.8,38.7,11.7,38.7,11.8c-0.1-0.2-0.2-0.3-0.2-0.4c0,0,0,0,0,0L27.9,0.8 c-0.1-0.1-0.2-0.2-0.3-0.2c0,0-0.1,0-0.1,0c-0.1-0.1-0.2-0.1-0.3-0.1c0,0,0,0-0.1,0c-0.1,0-0.2,0-0.2,0H13c-0.8,0-1.4,0.6-1.4,1.4 v29.4c0,0.8,0.6,1.4,1.4,1.4h6.3c0.8,0,1.4-0.6,1.4-1.4c0-0.8-0.6-1.4-1.4-1.4h-4.9V3.2h11.1v9.2c0,0.8,0.6,1.4,1.4,1.4h9.2v15.9 h-5.2c-0.8,0-1.4,0.6-1.4,1.4c0,0.8,0.6,1.4,1.4,1.4h6.7c0.8,0,1.4-0.6,1.4-1.4V12.4C38.9,12.2,38.8,12,38.7,11.8z M28.3,11V5.2 L34,11H28.3z\"></path></svg> </a></p>\n<p>How to most effectively bring that vision to life is an ongoing topic of conversation and learning at Barr – both at the staff and trustee level. We strive to be good partners in ways that go well beyond making grants. Studies by CEP and others have also noted the importance of funder-grantee partnerships. As a <a href=\"https://cep.org/provide-more-assistance-beyond-grant/\">recent CEP report</a> said, “Nonprofit CEOs speak to the value of funder-provided support beyond the grant — also known as nonmonetary assistance — noting that ‘the most valued funders are those who work with us to increase our capacity and impact.’”</p>\n<p>This approach requires serious investment outside of the grant transaction, and, therefore, trade-offs in how we apply our time and resources. We wanted to highlight some of the ways we endeavor to partner with organizations, our goals, and considerations we have to take into account. </p>\n<p>Here are a few examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Co-designing <strong>learning communities and learning opportunities</strong> to provide exposure to best practices, experts, and thought leaders in their fields. </li>\n<li>Organizing grantee convenings that support <strong>peer learning and collaboration among our grantees</strong>. </li>\n<li><strong>Strengthening key capacities for our partners</strong>, in areas such as data and analysis, communications, evaluation, finances, leadership, and diversity, equity, and inclusion. </li>\n<li>Working with grantees to design and implement <strong>evaluations that inform their work, Barr, and the field</strong>. </li>\n<li>Partnering with grantees to <strong>build fields of practice</strong>, especially in areas that are experimenting with new approaches.</li>\n<li>Supporting opportunities for grantee <strong>leadership via conference presentations and publications</strong>.<br/></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sometimes we do a combination of these things with multiple grantees participating in a larger initiative. Sometimes we do them in more targeted ways with individual grantees.  Major Barr initiatives like <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/education/engage-new-england\">Engage New England</a> and <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/arts-creativity/artsamplified\">ArtsAmplified</a> combine just about all of these components as they simultaneously strive to build capacity at the organizational level and to influence a broader field of practice.  Grantees are actively engaged in individual and cohort learning on topics they have helped prioritize, are convened for shared knowledge building, help design and learn from evaluation, and are supported in their field leadership. </p>\n<p>At times, Barr has provided funding for groups of grantees and other partners to participate in conferences, and to travel to see and learn from other places that are more advanced than our region. For example, our Climate Team sponsored a 2017 study tour to Seattle that yielded a number of <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/sound-lessons-from-seattle\">lessons for transportation leaders from Massachusetts</a>.  Such trips serve to deepen collective understanding and generate new thinking. They sometimes also spark new collaborations with potential for impact beyond what each organization could have on its own. </p>\n<p>When the Boston Public Schools sought to better understand its students’ paths and outcomes, Barr’s education program supported their engagement with EY-Parthenon to conduct a <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/new-report-details-challenges-facing-boston-s-public-high-schools\">comprehensive analysis of its high schools</a>. Through our new <a href=\"http://barrfdn.issuelab.org/?coverage=&amp;author=&amp;funder=&amp;publisher=&amp;wikitopic_categories=&amp;keywords=&amp;pubdate_start_year=1&amp;pubdate_end_year=1&amp;sort=&amp;categories=\">Knowledge Center</a> on the Barr website, we have begun publishing research like this and evaluations we have supported - to share our grantees’ learning and leadership with the field.</p>\n<p>All of these efforts require significant resources well beyond the grant dollar. They entail staff time, expertise and assistance of consultants, and expenses for things like training and convenings. We have to think carefully about when and how we take on these efforts, and the trade-offs involved. We need to be clear about their intended purpose and impact, to ensure they outweigh the value of an additional grant we might make, or an additional organization we might support. Even when grantees are excited about a field-building strategy, we need to stay attuned to how much of their time and energy we’re asking of them. And we need to make sure we remain responsive to new opportunities even as we sustain our focus on long-term partnerships. </p>\n<p>It is an immense privilege to partner with leaders and organizations dedicated to improving lives, communities, and our environment across this region. With a mission to be both stewards and catalysts, we seek to be a constructive partner to each of our grantees, while also working to build long-term impact in the field. These goals necessitate significant investments beyond the awarding of grants. And they require continually revisiting the trade-offs noted above, and evolving our approaches based on what we learn and hear from our grantees.  </p>\n"

      "Title": "Seven Questions with Shanna Cleveland",
      "Field2": "\n\n<h3>Would you tell us about your career path?</h3>\n<p>I grew up in a small town in Texas in the heart of the oil and gas fields, so I had a clear view of what energy meant—both good and bad—for people and our environment. I came from a family of cattle ranchers, and I grew up with a real connection to the outdoors and the land.</p>\n<p>When I first went to law school, I knew I wanted to do something positive for the public good, but I wasn’t sure where I could make a real contribution. I always thought that environmental law might be a good fit for me, and when circumstances led me to move to New England, I decided to attend Vermont Law School to explore that idea.</p>\n<p>At that time people were talking about a “resurgence” of coal-fired power even though we already understood the dangers of climate change. A light switched on, and I realized that working on energy issues would allow me to draw on my legal background as well as my personal experiences. </p>\n<h3>Tell us about what drew you to this opportunity at Barr?</h3>\n<p>I worked for several organizations in New England that were grantees of the Barr Foundation. There was something unique about the relationship we had with Barr—it was a collaborative effort grounded in a real partnership. The work I was able to do on natural gas leaks while I was at Conservation Law Foundation is a great example. It grew out of Mariella bringing me and Nathan Phillips together to talk about his research and led to a project that included gathering data and developing a legal and policy analysis. Over the years Barr has brought even more stakeholders to the table and that work has led to changes we could never have imagined. The idea of getting at these critical issues from a new perspective was exciting.</p>\n<h3>What lessons have you learned from working with communities?</h3>\n<p>Working with communities is the best way to get a clear view of what’s happening, what strategies are needed, and what the barriers might be to progress. Some of the most important lessons I've learned came from sitting around kitchen tables with neighbors and community organizers, just listening. When I started doing this work, I thought I was supposed to come in with all the answers, but over time I understood that you have to get to know the community and understand their experiences and concerns first. </p>\n<p>Only then can you build a strategy together that resonates with the people you’re supporting. I realized that the information and resources that I had access to were most effective when I connected them to the people who were living on the frontlines. </p>\n<h3>How can nonprofits and foundations more effectively communicate about clean energy and climate change?</h3>\n<p>Start by asking, “Who are my audiences and what matters most to them?” Whether you are engaging with agency officials, local communities, environmentalists, or other affected stakeholders, start by listening to get a sense of their biggest questions and what matters most to them. There are huge consequences associated with changes to the energy system and the impacts of climate change. We’re often discussing people’s fears and aspirations. It’s important to connect with people where they are. Instead of talking about “system reliability,” we ought to be talking about keeping respirators working and insulin refrigerated—those are the kinds of issues that are at stake. When we talk about what matters most, we can connect with our audiences meaningfully. </p>\n<h3>What is the most significant barrier to advancing clean energy in the region?</h3>\n<p>We need to communicate what is possible with clean energy. We can design a  system that is more flexible, more resilient, and less polluting. Getting there requires  imagination and innovation, but that’s an opportunity, not a burden. The climate is changing and the grid has to change to meet a new set of demands.</p>\n<p>There is a lot to be excited about with clean energy—we actually can get to 100 percent renewable power. To advance clean energy, people need to understand the benefits of a modern grid: new jobs, clean air, self-sufficiency during a storm. We have to paint that picture more clearly so people can see themselves in it. </p>\n<h3>What is one thing that might surprise people to learn about working in climate and clean energy?</h3>\n<p>A clean energy future is not just possible, it will be cheaper and more responsive to customer demands and climate impacts. The key isn’t some new technology that we haven’t yet discovered. The key is planning for it and building markets that accelerate rather than stall technological progress.  </p>\n<h3>You have worked and lived throughout New England. What are some of your favorite things to do in the area?</h3>\n<p>I love being outdoors. One of my favorite activities is riding my bicycle in beautiful places here in New England because I think we’re incredibly lucky to live in such an amazing place. I just get a whole different view when I'm on my bike. I ride out by the Minuteman National Historic Park a lot. I also love taking my dogs to places where they can run around—like the Middlesex Fells or Menotomy Rocks Park. </p>\n"

      "Field2": "\n\n<p>The Barr Foundation’s <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/about\">mission statement</a> can be distilled to three words: “invest in potential.” Simply put, we support efforts that expand potential as we aim to address those barriers that inhibit people and communities from reaching their full potential. </p>\n<p>This focus on “potential” mandates that we continually explore how the principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) advance Barr’s mission. Indeed, we embrace the value of diversity in all of its forms, the importance of inclusion, and the integration of equity in all of our work.</p>\n<p>Acknowledging that our journey is ongoing, and that we remain a work in progress, I wanted to share a few reflections from the last 18 months, during which we have devoted considerable time as a staff and board developing shared vocabulary; learning about our (individual and collective) cultural competencies, biases, and blind spots; and engaging in the deep, and often uncomfortable and challenging, work that a commitment to DEI entails.</p>\n<p>Over the course of 2020, my colleagues and I intend to share more about what we are learning and what we are doing as a result. To begin, I offer five key lessons to date from my vantage point:</p>\n<h3>Leadership engagement is crucial.</h3>\n<p>When we started this work, I consulted with foundation peers who had led organizational efforts related to DEI. There was one consistent lesson in all that I read and learned: for DEI work to result in meaningful change, leadership must create an “authorizing environment.” </p>\n<p>Put another way, leaders can’t delegate this work; you have to be prepared to engage deeply and authentically, and to commit the requisite time that demonstrates this is an organizational priority. As a result, both our Vice President, Roger Nozaki, and I have served on Barr’s internal DEI Working Group. Our board chair, Barbara Hostetter, has also participated in all of the trainings, retreats, and working sessions we have organized for staff. Importantly, we have also engaged our trustees in reflections on our collective learning and its implications. In all that we have done, there has been no ambiguity about leadership commitment and buy-in.</p>\n<h3>This is long-term work.</h3>\n<p>Each year, I set out a series of priorities for the Foundation, which I share with staff in January. In effect, these serve as my goals as the leader of the institution and aim to provide clarity and direction about organizational imperatives. In January 2018, in identifying DEI as an organizational priority for our collective time and focus, I emphasized that it would not be a single-year effort. Indeed, DEI remained a priority for 2019. It will, again, be an organizational focus in 2020, with efforts underway across the foundation – both at the program level and in cross-functional teams – to ensure our internal and external work reflect our core values and commitment to continue learning together.</p>\n<p>Toward that latter end, in spring 2020, we are committing to an all-staff learning journey to Montgomery, Alabama, to visit the Equal Justice Initiative’s National Memorial for Peace and Justice and Legacy Museum. Through this experience, we aim to deepen our understanding of the history of slavery and legacy of racial oppression and segregation, and the distinctive ways that various parts of the country – including New England – have contributed to and been shaped by this legacy; and to explore how this history and legacy link to the work of organized philanthropy and to Barr’s context in Boston and New England.</p>\n<p>We will continue our learning this year, not just by taking this journey to the South, but also by devoting time in advance of this trip to a learning series organized by our colleague, Cecilia Hylton.  As we do all of this, we fully acknowledge that an authentic commitment to this work means it is never really done.</p>\n<h3>You must become comfortable with discomfort.</h3>\n<p>In the latter part of 2018, we engaged two consultants with expertise in DEI and organizational change - Beth Zemsky and Parisa Parsa. They have been superb guides and allies for us and, from the beginning, have reinforced the need to become “comfortable with discomfort.” </p>\n<p>This has proven an important admonition, especially as we have surfaced aspects of our own culture, policies, and processes that are counterproductive to our values and goals (for example, a tendency to minimize conflict, if not avoid it entirely). When staff have been courageous enough to voice concerns, it has created challenging moments. Yet, these moments have also presented rich opportunities for learning and growth. For me, hearing some of the challenges and experiences described by my colleagues was difficult, as it forced me to question my own leadership and whether I had been sufficiently attuned to what my colleagues were experiencing. I have learned a great deal by listening, and allowing myself to sit with my own discomfort, rather than quickly moving to activate solutions.</p>\n<h3>Internal work must translate to action.</h3>\n<p>All of this work is in service to our mission of investing in potential, and to being a constructive partner to those we support. If this exercise with DEI remains solely focused on our own organizational dynamics and culture, it will be incomplete. The ultimate value of this investment of time and organizational energy will be in how much more effective we can be at “investing in potential” – and how it informs the decisions we make about our grantmaking strategies, who we support and how, and how we engage in partnership. This will be an area of focus for us in 2020, and we will have more to share over the course of the year.</p>\n<h3>A commitment to humility is essential.</h3>\n<p>One of our core values at Barr centers on humility, where we state: “we approach our activities with respect for our partners, an understanding that solutions reside with those we serve, and recognition of the privilege inherent in philanthropic work.” As Bryan Stevenson, Founder and Executive Director of the Equal Justice Initiative, rightly notes, a commitment to humility is essential in DEI work: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I don't think that we should expect to make progress on these issues without bumping into one another, without making mistakes. We just have to have the humility and the patience and the courage to work through that.\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is that spirit that has informed our work to date, and I am confident we will be both a better organization and a more effective partner to others as we continue on this important and transforming journey together.  </p>\n<p>We are eager to share our perspectives with you, and we welcome your advice and observations as we continue our effort to listen, to learn, and to act, with the requisite humility that acknowledges we don’t have all of the answers, and the clear expectation that we will continue to improve as we learn and engage more deeply in this vital work.</p>\n"

      "Title": "Building on Growth as We Enter a New Decade",
      "Field2": "\n\n<p>The past decade has witnessed significant growth and ongoing evolution for the Barr Foundation. As we begin 2020, I have been reflecting on how much has changed even in my six years here. Since 2014, Barr has:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased grantmaking significantly from annual allocations in the low $50 million range to over $90 million of grantmaking in 2019, with $95 million planned for 2020.</li>\n<li>Doubled the size of our staff from 19 to 38, with most of the additions on our program teams, thereby expanding our capacity to work with and serve our partners.</li>\n<li>Invested in a deepened commitment to communications as well as learning and evaluation, addressing the mission imperatives of transparency, openness, and ongoing improvement. </li>\n<li>Expanded the board from our two co-founders to seven trustees today, with a majority of them as non-family trustees. We will continue to augment the board in the years ahead. </li>\n<li>Grown our office space, enabling us to convene our partners more easily and to host many more outside meetings.</li>\n<li>Surpassed $2 billion in assets at the same time as we have exceeded $1 billion in total grants awarded since Barr’s inception.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These have been important steps, but what matters most is progress on the goals we and our partners focus on, particularly in our core areas of Arts and Creativity, Climate, and Education. To that end, I would commend our most recent <a href=\"https://2019.barrfoundation.org/\">Year In Review</a>, published last month, which describes much of the work this expanded capacity has enabled. We remain ever grateful to the many partners and allies who share our mission of investing in potential and who, like us, push for greater aspiration.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"Pullquote\"> <p>We remain ever grateful to the many partners and allies who share our mission of investing in potential and who, like us, push for greater aspiration.</p> </blockquote>\n<p><strong>New Colleagues</strong></p>\n<p>We enter 2020 by welcoming several new colleagues to the team: Adrian Jones will serve in the newly-created role of Executive Assistant and Manager of Board Operations, working closely with me, Roger Nozaki, and our trustees. Adrian joins us from Signet Education, where he spent eight years in several roles focused on client coordination and management. </p>\n<p>We also welcome Pouya Shahbodaghi as our new Enterprise Applications Manager, bringing needed capacity for our expanded information technology needs. Pouya brings extensive Salesforce and related experience as well as knowledge of the nonprofit sector, having worked in IT at both Year Up and WGBH. </p>\n<p>In November, we also <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/giles-li-appointed-senior-program-officer-for-arts-creativity\">announced the appointment of Giles Li</a>, who will join us next month as Senior Program Officer in the Arts and Creativity program. </p>\n<p><strong>Gratitude</strong></p>\n<p>As we welcome new colleagues, we also express our gratitude to several colleagues who have recently moved on or will this month. Jane Joyce, Trevor Pollack, Cindy Lung, and Prerna Sekhri each made valuable and important contributions during their tenures, and we are grateful for their colleagueship and friendship. </p>\n<p>A personal note of thanks to Jane Joyce, my Executive Assistant, who this month marked her 14th anniversary at Barr. As she retires from the Foundation, we will all miss her wide-ranging intellect, ever-present graciousness, and wicked sense of humor. I am especially grateful to her for her support and counsel over the almost-six years we have worked closely together.</p>\n<p><strong>A New Leadership Position</strong></p>\n<p>In view of the significant growth at Barr in recent years, we are creating a new senior position to provide leadership and oversight for Barr’s operations, grants management, and talent development functions. To that end, we will launch a search later this month for a new Vice President for Administration, who will work closely with me and Roger, whose title will shift to Vice President for Programs and Strategy. To conduct a national search for this vital leadership role, we have retained the firm of Isaacson, Miller, and we will share more detail on this new position later in January. </p>\n<p><a class=\"button -medium\" data-track='{\"type\":\"event\",\"category\":\"Button\",\"action\":\"Learn more and apply for this new position\",\"label\":\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/barr-seeks-vice-president-for-administration\"}' href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/barr-seeks-vice-president-for-administration\">Learn more and apply for this new position</a> </p>\n<p>With all that I have described above, we enter this decade focused on equipping the Foundation for continued growth with care and excellence.  Philanthropy is fundamentally a human enterprise, and I am grateful for the talented and dedicated team at Barr who have embraced the many changes and shifts described above with enthusiasm and commitment to our mission. </p>\n<p>And all of us at the Foundation understand that we do nothing alone at Barr; the change we seek is made real by the leaders we are privileged to support. We remain ever grateful to them for their partnership and dedication and look forward to driving progress on the many challenges and opportunities before us.</p>\n"

      "Title": "In Conversation: District Attorney Rachael Rollins",
      "Field2": "\n\n<p><em>Last week, the Barr Foundation hosted its first virtual “In Conversation” featuring significant leaders in our communities. Mary Skelton Roberts, Barr’s Co-Director of Climate interviewed Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins. Their discussion began with DA Rollins’ personal history and path into the District Attorney’s office. From there, they explored the legacy and impacts of racism and gender discrimination in our region, and the distinct role of policing and the criminal justice system.</em></p>\n<p>A video of the webinar is available below, followed by some highlights from the conversation:</p>\n<div class=\"Media -full\"> <div class=\"u-fluid-iframe\"> <div class=\"u-fluid-iframe-inner\"> <iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" data-ready=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/466423935?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0\" title=\"Video: Conversation with DA Rollins\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\"> <a href=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/466423935?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0\">A video on Vimeo</a> </iframe> </div> </div> </div>\n<p>Since being elected in 2018, DA Rollins has fought to make the criminal justice system more just for all. Asked about a <a href=\"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/09/black-latinx-people-overrepresented-in-massachusetts-prisons-study-says/\">recent Harvard University study</a> that found Black and Latinx people are overrepresented in Massachusetts’ criminal justice system and that they receive longer sentences than their white counterparts, the DA commented that the report is helpful “in giving us teeth to say ‘this isn’t just a feeling that certain people had. This is sustained with evidence.’”</p>\n<p>The DA also recently released the names of 136 local police officers accused of misconduct – something that, previously, defense attorneys or juries had no way of knowing. As Rollins described, this information is critical for a fair process. </p>\n<p>“If an officer is testifying in a domestic violence case and he or she has been arrested twice for domestic violence, or is testifying in a OUI and he or she has two OUIs, that’s important information,” Rollins said. “If you don’t believe the system works, people aren’t going to partake in the system. I don’t mean just defendants; I mean if you witness a crime. We need to start mending those relationships. When we do that, I believe it results in safer communities and we will solve more crime.”</p>\n<p>The DA also cited the “Varsity Blues” and Breonna Taylor cases as prime examples of the law not being applied equally to all people, and how that must change to create trust in our justice system. “There are people that fully believe and have every right to believe that the criminal system is broken,” she said. “And it isn’t helping certain communities. In fact, it is harming them more than it is helping.”</p>\n<p>In closing the conversation, DA Rollins affirmed how vital it is to engage a greater diversity of community perspectives, especially those personally impacted by harmful policies – if we are ever to tackle inequity and create a region in which everyone can thrive. </p>\n<p>To philanthropic organizations, she offered the following advice: “Use your data to give money to the areas that need it more. I want you to invest in giving young or new leaders the platform they need.”</p>\n<p>At Barr, investing in leaders is a core value. As our city, region, and nation grapple with COVID-19 and the latest national reckoning over structural racism and anti-Blackness, we need effective, visionary, and collaborative leaders, who motivate others, drive change, and produce results. </p><blockquote class=\"Pullquote\"> <p>As our city, region, and nation grapple with COVID-19 and the latest national reckoning over structural racism and anti-Blackness, we need effective, visionary, and collaborative leaders.</p> </blockquote> We are grateful to have been able to showcase just such a leader in District Attorney Rachael Rollins.<p></p>\n"

      "Title": "Barr Announces $4.15 Million in New Grantmaking Centered on Racial Equity",
      "Field2": "\n\n<p>In August, I wrote about <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/an-enduring-commitment-to-racial-equity\">Barr’s enduring commitment to racial equity</a>, outlining plans to expand our grantmaking in future years – both through Barr’s core programs of Arts &amp; Creativity, Climate, and Education, and through support of targeted efforts beyond our core programs. </p>\n<p>Today, I am pleased to announce new grantmaking of $4.15 million, representing our latest steps in making Barr’s expressed commitment tangible. With a focus on advancing racial equity in Boston and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, we have awarded the following grants:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$1 million to support the <a href=\"https://kingboston.org/king-center-for-economic-justice/\">King Boston Center for Economic Justice</a>, payable over four years. This grant will provide core support as the Center develops action-oriented solutions aimed at eliminating the economic and social inequities that affect Boston’s communities of color.</li>\n<li>$200,000 to support the City of Boston’s recently-established <a href=\"https://www.boston.gov/departments/resilience-and-racial-equity\">Office of Equity</a>, led by Dr. Karilyn Crockett. These resources will help to build staff capacity as well as support strategic planning, research, and community outreach efforts as the Office embeds equity across the policies and practices of various City departments.</li>\n<li>$175,000 to support the <a href=\"https://www.tbf.org/donors/forms/new-commonwealth-fund\">New Commonwealth Racial Equity and Social Justice Fund</a>, for capacity building and development of key infrastructure and its stakeholder engagement strategy. </li>\n<li>$100,000 to support the <a href=\"https://kingboston.org/the-forward-fund/\">Forward Fund</a>, a collaborative fund managed by King Boston that will regrant resources in support of BIPOC-led, grassroots organizations that provide direct services, engage in advocacy, and provide mutual aid. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to these four grants to new partners, Barr has awarded grants that augment and extend support to a set of organizations to which we made grants earlier this year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In total, these grant augmentations represent new commitments of $2,675,000 to 31 organizations. </p>\n<p>In April, Barr awarded general operating and core support grants to a number of <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/barr-commits-2-million-to-immigrant-serving-organizations\">organizations that principally support immigrant communities</a>, which have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. Then, in July, we awarded another round of similar grants, this time to a group of <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/barr-awards-1-36-million-to-nonprofits-supporting-black-communities-in-response-to-covid-19\">organizations that primarily serve Black communities in the Commonwealth</a>. </p>\n<p>The 31 grants we’re announcing today represent a doubling of the amount and length for any of those grants that had been initially awarded as one-year grants. As before, these grants are for unrestricted general operating or core support, to provide organizations with the greatest latitude in the use of these funds.   </p>\n<p>We recognize that the effects of this pandemic will endure into and well beyond 2021, and we determined it was vital to provide this additional, flexible support to organizations that are serving communities of color, and that are also primarily led and governed by people of color. The list of grant recipients and amounts follows here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>African Community Education Program ($50,000)</li>\n<li>Berkshire Immigrant Center ($50,000, <em>Fiscal Sponsor is the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition</em>)</li>\n<li>Black Economic Council of Massachusetts ($150,000)</li>\n<li>Black Economic Justice Institute ($50,000)</li>\n<li>Black Ministerial Alliance of Greater Boston ($125,000)</li>\n<li>Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center ($100,000)</li>\n<li>Boston Ujima Project ($100,000, <em>Fiscal Sponsor is Center for Economic Democracy</em>)</li>\n<li>Brazilian Immigrant Center dba Brazilian Workers Center ($75,000)</li>\n<li>Catholic Services of Fall River ($50,000)</li>\n<li>Centro Comunitario de Trabajadores ($50,000)</li>\n<li>Centro Presente ($75,000)</li>\n<li>East Boston Ecumenical Community Council ($50,000)</li>\n<li>Gardening the Community ($50,000, <em>Fiscal Sponsor is Third Sector New England</em>)</li>\n<li>GreenRoots ($125,000)</li>\n<li>Immigrant Family Services Institute ($50,000)</li>\n<li>Inquilinos Boricuas en Acción ($100,000)</li>\n<li>Justice at Work ($50,000)</li>\n<li>La Colaborativa (formerly Chelsea Collaborative) ($125,000)</li>\n<li>Lawyers for Civil Rights ($150,000)</li>\n<li>Martin Luther King Jr. Family Services ($100,000)</li>\n<li>Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition ($150,000)</li>\n<li>Massachusetts Law Reform Institute ($75,000)</li>\n<li>Neighbor to Neighbor Massachusetts Education Fund ($75,000)</li>\n<li>Political Asylum Immigration Representation Project ($75,000)</li>\n<li>Rian Immigrant Center ($150,000)</li>\n<li>Sociedad Latina ($100,000)</li>\n<li>Southeast Asian Coalition of Central Massachusetts ($50,000)</li>\n<li>The Islamic Society of Boston ($50,000)</li>\n<li>Urban Farming Institute of Boston ($75,000)</li>\n<li>Urban Guild ($50,000)</li>\n<li>Urban Revival dba City Life/Vida Urbana ($150,000)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In awarding these grants, we recognized that nonprofits have long argued that general operating support is the most valuable support foundations can provide; that foundation application processes can be cumbersome and unwieldy; and that the lag time between submitting a proposal to a funder and receiving a decision can be far too long. </p>\n<p>These realities informed how we approached these grants – streamlining and expediting our internal processes to provide flexible support to organizations and programs quickly and responsively. While these particular actions were prompted by an unprecedented pandemic, it is my intention that we at Barr apply what we learn from this experience to how we work going forward, as we strive to become more effective in service to our nonprofit partners and their leaders. </p>\n"

We will miss his ambassadorial skills that, in his five-plus years here, were constantly deployed on behalf of Barr in communities across the city. Those who have worked with Rahn know he brings not only considerable skills and experience, but also a deep commitment to improving educational outcomes and a thoughtful approach that is always respectful and inclusive of a multitude of perspectives.</p>\n<p>We look forward to a new phase of partnership with Rahn in this vital new leadership role for Boston. </p>\n<p>To ensure a smooth transition of his various responsibilities, Rahn plans to remain at Barr full time through Friday, September 19, and also to dedicate a few hours per week through the end of October.

      "Title": "The Human Factor",
      "Field2": "\n\n<p>Early in my career in philanthropy, I discovered a speech by Alan Pifer, past president of the Carnegie Corporation of New York from 1967-1982. This passage about foundation staff has remained with me ever since I encountered it: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“Above all other aspects of foundation work, I would put the human factor. I mean by this the attitudes and behavior of foundation staff members. If they are arrogant, self-important, dogmatic, conscious of power and status, or filled with a sense of their own omniscience—traits which the stewardship of money tends to bring out in some people—the foundation they serve cannot be a good one.</em> </p>\n<p><em>If, on the other hand, they have genuine humility, are conscious of their own limitations, are aware that money does not confer wisdom, are humane, intellectually alive and curious people, men and women who above all else are eager to learn from others—the foundation they serve will probably be a good one.”</em> </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The “human factor” matters for <strong>all</strong> organizations; indeed, it’s why one of our core values at Barr is to “invest in leaders”.  </p>\n<p>For me, as one who has spent the past 18 years leading two different foundations, Pifer’s wise words have served as a guide in the recruitment, development and cultivation of talent. Indeed, one of my most important responsibilities as a leader has been to ensure that our organization both attracts great talent and supports and develops that talent once it’s on board.  </p>\n<h3>Welcoming New Colleagues</h3>\n<p>While the past 18 months of full remote work have certainly shifted our hiring processes, we have had the good fortune of attracting some outstanding individuals, and I am delighted to introduce our latest staff additions: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/julie-rosen\">Julie Rosen</a> joined us in August as Senior Accountant, having worked most recently at Standish Management LLC and prior to that at KPMG LLP. Working closely with our controller, Julie is actively engaged in all financial matters of the foundation. </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/najah-casimir\">Najah Casimir</a> joined us this month as our new Program Officer in Climate, working primarily with the Mobility strategy. Najah served as communications manager for the Cambridge transportation department and prior to that worked in the Boston Transportation Department.<br/></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/jules-fana\">Jules Faña</a> joined us this month in the newly-created role of Communications Coordinator. She brings substantive experience in graphic design, social media, visual storytelling and photography, all of which will serve to enrich and enliven our communications efforts. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>We eagerly look forward to benefiting from their experience, perspective, and passion for Barr’s mission and strategies. </p>\n<h3>Enabling Growth and Advancement</h3>\n<p>We are also committed to supporting the development of Barr staff during their time with us.  With Barr’s rapid growth and the increasing breadth and complexity of our program strategies, we have been fortunate and appreciative of colleagues who have stepped up, taken on new challenges, and expanded their responsibilities to support our mission.  </p>\n<p>In that context, I am delighted to announce promotions we have made in the past few months, alphabetically: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/kalila-barnett\">Kalila Barnett</a> to Senior Program Officer in Climate<br/></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/christi-craig\">Christi Craig</a> to Senior Manager, Grants Management and Business Systems </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/john-dello-russo\">John Dello Russo</a> to Program Associate in Sector Effectiveness/Special Initiatives </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/maryam-hamedany\">Maryam Hamedany</a> to Grants Management Associate </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/alexandra-juckno\">Alexandra Juckno</a> to Program Associate in Arts &amp; Creativity </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/sueellen-kroll\">SueEllen Kroll</a> to Senior Program Officer in Arts &amp; Creativity </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/emily-sidla\">Emily Sidla</a> to Program Manager, Climate </li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, we have appointed <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/mary-chalifour\">Mary Chalifour</a> to the role of Acting Director of Communications through summer 2022. A member of Barr’s communications team since 2014, Mary has served as Communications Officer and will bring both deep experience and substantive knowledge to this important leadership role. I am grateful for her willingness to take on this leadership assignment while our Director of Communications, Stefan Lanfer, is on a one-year leave of absence for a Fulbright Scholarship in Zambia.  </p>\n<h3>Celebrating New Opportunities</h3>\n<p>We also recognize that the right next opportunity for a colleague may be outside of Barr – a chance to build on their experience, stretch in new directions, and contribute their talents in new ways.  So, I conclude by celebrating prior colleagues who have taken on exciting, new professional roles beyond Barr.  </p>\n<p>Our former Climate program co-director, Mary Skelton Roberts, departed earlier this year for an outstanding leadership opportunity as Senior Vice President of Programs at the Energy Foundation. Our former Climate colleague Shanna Cleveland has also joined the Energy Foundation as Program Director, Northeast Policy. And our former Senior Accountant, Tim Chiong, has not ventured too far, taking on a new investment operations focused role within Pilot House Associates, Barr’s affiliated family office.  </p>\n<p>In each case, we are grateful for the contributions made to Barr over the years, and we are excited for the new professional opportunities that await Mary, Shanna and Tim, much as we will miss them. As we always say when a colleague departs the Foundation, they will always be a member of the extended Barr family. </p>\n<p>A key element of developing talent is creating opportunities for our colleagues to learn and to grow while at Barr and, when the time is right, to pursue professional paths that enable them to apply that learning in different settings. We aim to have open and honest discussions with our colleagues about their ambitions and goals, so we can best equip them to pursue the pathways they seek for their career development. It’s always a balancing act as none of us want to lose talented staff, but given our mission and the larger context of our work, it’s often to the benefit of those larger purposes when colleagues take on new roles.   </p>\n<p>The strength of any organization lies in the quality and capacity of its people, and that is absolutely the case for us at Barr. As these appointments, promotions, and transitions demonstrate, we are fortunate to have a talented, diverse, and committed group of colleagues. I am proud of the work we do each and every day—in partnership with many others—in pursuit of ambitious goals. </p>\n"

      "Title": "The Real Work Persists",
      "Field2": "\n\n<p>It was six days into 2021 when we witnessed the <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/we-should-not-be-surprised\">horrifying insurrection</a> at our nation’s capital. As we bring this year to a close, the images of that day seem so long ago and far away. And yet, the sentiments that fueled that unprecedented attack persist, as does the ongoing quest for accountability. The implications of that day will surely remain with us as we turn the page to 2022. </p>\n<p>And, indeed, we must not ignore those implications: for our commitment to racial equity, for the promise of that “more perfect Union” enshrined in our Constitution, and for how we live out our shared humanity. All of this must continue to animate the work we do across Barr, in partnership with so many others.  </p>\n<p>We may not characterize Barr’s work as a “democracy funder”, but at the heart of our mission—to invest in potential across the arts, climate, and education—lies the assumption that our democratic system actually functions, in its many manifestations.  </p>\n<p>And yet, the way in which 2021 started should deeply trouble us all, as it rendered most explicitly what had long been implicit. It must remain our shared work to battle the intolerance and hatred made manifest on that day, to counter the destruction—physical and moral—of our democracy, and to confront the blatant disregard for human rights for all. </p>\n<p>So, as we look toward a new year, which often brings with it opportunities for reflection and resolution, we seek to turn the page in a way that invites us to reinvent, rebuild, and revitalize.  </p>\n<blockquote class=\"Pullquote\"> As we look toward a new year...we seek to turn the page in a way that invites us to reinvent, rebuild, and revitalize. <a class=\"Pullquote-cta\" href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet/?dnt=true&amp;text=We+seek+to+turn+the+page+in+a+way+that+invites+us+to+reinvent%2C+rebuild%2C+and+revitalize.+-%40jcanales\"> <svg class=\"Icon\" height=\"48\" viewbox=\"628 -718 2048 2048\" width=\"48\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"> <path d=\"M2417.2-86.6c1.2,17,1.2,33.9,1.2,50.9c0,517.3-393.8,1113.4-1113.4,1113.4c-221.7,0-427.7-64.2-601-175.7 c31.5,3.6,61.8,4.8,94.5,4.8c183,0,351.4-61.8,485.8-167.2c-172-3.6-316.2-116.3-365.9-271.4c24.2,3.6,48.5,6.1,73.9,6.1 c35.1,0,70.3-4.8,103-13.3C916.1,424.7,781.6,267.2,781.6,76.9c0-1.2,0-3.6,0-4.8c52.1,29.1,112.7,47.2,176.9,49.7 C853.1,51.5,784-68.4,784-204.2c0-72.7,19.4-139.3,53.3-197.5C1030-164.2,1319.6-9.1,1644.3,7.9c-6.1-29.1-9.7-59.4-9.7-89.7 c0-215.7,174.5-391.3,391.3-391.3c112.7,0,214.4,47.2,285.9,123.6c88.4-17,173.3-49.7,248.4-94.5c-29.1,90.9-90.9,167.2-172,215.7 c78.7-8.5,155.1-30.3,225.3-60.6C2560.2-211.4,2493.6-142.4,2417.2-86.6z\"></path> </svg> Tweet This </a> </blockquote>\n<p>Many have observed, and I happen to agree, that we must not—and cannot—go back to how things used to be, which we know were not equitable, were not just, were not inclusive. We must shape a new reality together.  </p>\n<p>And we will. </p>\n<p>Through Barr’s website and blog, we aim to share what we are doing, the lessons we are learning, and the impact being driven by our partners. We remain grateful to them for their leadership, vision, dedication, and tenacity, in the face of the many headwinds that 2021 continued to bring. </p>\n<h4>As we turn to 2022, I offer a few organizational updates that will surely inform our continued work at Barr:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><p>We will conclude 2021 having <strong>awarded over $122 million in new grants</strong>, another all-time high for Barr. This represents a 35% increase from grants awarded in 2020, and we are grateful to the many partners who will use these resources in ways that create tangible change and advance progress on our shared priorities. </p></li>\n<li><p>For 2022, our board of trustees has <strong>approved a grants budget of $140 million</strong>, a 15% increase from this year’s grantmaking, and more than 55% above 2020 grant levels. This continues the growth trajectory we have been planning for.  </p></li>\n<li><p>As we grow Barr’s grantmaking, we continue to <strong>expand and enhance our team</strong>. In the past few months alone, we have welcomed three new colleagues: <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/najah-casimir\">Najah Casimir</a> as program officer in Climate; <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/jules-fana\">Jules Faña</a> as communications coordinator, a new position; and <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/julie-rosen\">Julie Rosen</a> as senior accountant. In January, we will welcome Kathryn Wright as senior program officer for Climate, and we will initiate a search for a new program officer in Arts &amp; Creativity. We have plans for additional staff in 2022, which we will share as the year unfolds. </p></li>\n<li><p>In March 2022, we will initiate our <strong>formal return to Barr’s new hybrid workplace</strong>, circumstances permitting. We will do so marking two full years as an all-remote operation. With the arrival of spring, and its promise of renewal, we will start shaping new hybrid work practices for Barr. As we do so, we greatly look forward to seeing many of you as the year unfolds, shifting from our 2-D Zoom existence to in-person, human interaction, which we have greatly missed. </p></li>\n<li><p>In the opening months of 2022, we will also <strong>share our annual “year in review”</strong>, but, this time, with a look back at the past two years given the decision last year to forgo the project due to the pandemic. We will explore how our work has unfolded with a deepened commitment to racial equity over these past two years, and we will share how we plan to look to the future in new ways. </p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As we turn to 2022, we do so with lingering uncertainties: about the trajectory of the ongoing pandemic, about the seriousness with which all of us will directly address the ongoing challenges of racial inequality and systemic racism, and, even, about the state of our very democracy. But, rather than be discouraged, we are called to redouble efforts to do the vital work ahead. </p>\n<p>As a former high school English teacher, I often turn to inspiration from literature, and in this case, poetry. As we look to the work ahead, I leave you with the words of poet Wendell Berry, reminding us of the nature of “real work”. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Our Real Work<br/>\nWendell Berry</em></strong></p>\n<p><em>It may be that when we no longer know what to do<br/>\nwe have come to our real work,<br/>\nand that when we no longer know which way to go<br/>\nwe have come to our real journey.<br/>\nThe mind that is not baffled is not employed.<br/>\nThe impeded stream is the one that sings.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n"

      "Field2": "\n\n<p>It is my pleasure to announce that Jenny Curtin has been appointed Director of Education at the Barr Foundation, effective this week. In this role, Jenny will provide strategic direction and leadership for Barr’s Education Program in its work to advance educational equity in high schools across New England so that all young people, regardless of race or background, achieve at high levels. One of Barr’s three core programs, Education has a 2022 grantmaking budget that will exceed $40 million.  </p>\n<p></p><div class=\"Media -aside -left\"> <div class=\"Media-imageWrapper\"> <img alt=\"jenny curtin brick 2022\" class=\"Media-image\" src=\"https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/crop/4775/square_crop.jpg?1664289102\"/> </div> <div class=\"Media-caption\"> <p>Jenny Curtin appointed Director of Education</p> </div> </div>Jenny joined Barr in early 2016 as Senior Program Officer after over a decade at the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. Shortly after arriving, she helped launch a new set of education strategies and took the lead on the largest component - Catalyze New Models. She has led the development and execution of that strategy over the past six and a half years, continually refining its approach and elements as it has grown into a nearly $24 million portfolio. <p></p>\n<p>Jenny now assumes leadership of the full set of three aligned strategies: <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/catalyze-new-models\">Catalyze New Models</a> promotes efforts to transform the high school experience to fit the local context and support all students to thrive; <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/invest-in-educators\">Invest in Educators</a> seeks to support the development of skilled and diverse pipelines of teachers and leaders who bring new educational models to life; and <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/build-public-will\">Build Public Will</a> aims to engage and support a wide range of people as advocates for the kinds of schools that serve all of our students well.</p>\n<p>With a combination of deep expertise, thoughtfulness, and humility, Jenny has been a trusted partner to people working to transform high schools at the school, district, and state levels. Her knowledge and networks span the education policy landscape across our region and nationally. Over the past four months as Acting Director, Jenny readily stepped into leadership of the Education Program and team. Continuing to move that work forward, including hiring and onboarding several new staff and reflecting on the overall strategy and team structure, she also engaged with Barr’s other program directors and leadership on a range of issues for the Foundation. Most importantly, she has shown an unwavering commitment to keep students at the center and continuously learn, improve, and strengthen efforts to expand high-quality education opportunities – especially for students who have not been well served by typical approaches.</p>\n<p>This is such a critical moment for public education. Many of our education partners have been telling us this has been the most trying time of their lives. And yet those same partners have been demonstrating what is possible when we hold high expectations and create learning environments that help all students discover and achieve their full potential. This is what inspires Jenny and all of us. </p>\n<p>We continue to be so grateful to each and every one of our partners for the urgency, creativity, and persistence you bring. And we are thrilled to have Jenny taking on this leadership role to partner and support you in this work.</p>\n"

      "Title": "New Tactics. Same Commitment to Community and Mission-Driven Communications.",
      "Field2": "\n\n<p>In November 2022, we decided to pause activity on Barr’s Twitter account. We are now extending that pause for the foreseeable future. With this message, we want to share how we came to our decision and ways to stay connected to Barr going forward. We hope this is helpful to others grappling with the same decision.</p>\n<p>Like many foundations, nonprofits, and mission-driven organizations making similar moves, our initial decision to pause was a response to concerning changes at Twitter following the company’s October 2022 buyout – especially related to a marked decline in content moderation and the user experience. We wanted time to see if the platform would stabilize and how. More importantly, we wanted time to reflect as a team and talk with colleagues, partners, and peers about their concerns, ideas, and any help they were looking for.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, we determined that, for Barr, the costs of staying active on Twitter outweighed the benefits – which, on closer look, had really been decreasing for a while. Answering three key questions helped us get there:</p>\n<h3>What are our goals for social media?</h3>\n<p>One of our main goals for all communications at Barr is to build trust and strong relationships. That’s why we joined Twitter in 2014. It was Barr’s first social media platform and it provided a useful space for us to be open and transparent about who we are, what we’re up to, and why. We also came to value Twitter as an open and welcoming forum to listen and learn from peers, grantees, other partners and field leaders, and to engage in a thoughtful exchange of ideas. Over time, as we built our Twitter following, it also became a way for us to bring positive attention to our partners’ work.</p>\n<p>We got on Twitter for what felt like good reasons. For a time, we experienced good value and results. Sometimes it was even fun. But things changed.</p>\n<h3>How have our costs and benefits of being active on Twitter changed?</h3>\n<p><strong>It’s not so safe, civil, or trustworthy anymore.</strong> Abruptly terminating Twitter staff responsible for content moderation and not enforcing community guidelines have led to marked increases in hate speech, racial slurs, violent threats, and misinformation. The idea of a “digital town square” for open and thoughtful exchange of ideas is a worthy goal. It’s the idea that drew us to Twitter in the first place. But, for us, it's not that kind of space anymore.</p>\n<p><strong>Who’s in charge and how they engage matters.</strong> It makes our engagement a values question. When we joined Twitter, we didn’t consider who owned it, their values, agenda, or the impact of their presence on the culture and quality of the online community. Today, that feels like something we need to consider. When a social media owner uses their own company to boost their personal visibility, reach, and influence, we have to ask whether they are aligned or in open conflict with our values and mission. When they author, applaud, and amplify misinformation, hate speech, and worse, we need to consider how staying (and encouraging our partners to keep following and engaging with us there) can look like we’re fine with all that, that we’re clueless about it, or that we just don’t care. </p>\n<p><strong>Most people who choose to follow us on Twitter don’t see what we share.</strong> One of our digital strategy partners, <a href=\"https://www.forumone.com/\">Forum One</a>, recently analyzed a group of 50 organizations on Twitter and found that, on average, only 4.4% of their followers saw anything they published. We asked Forum One to look at our data as well. On average last year, only 1.9% of Barr's 10,500 followers saw our tweets. We’d known for a while that Twitter, like other social media platforms, was changing its algorithms to favor paid over such “organic” content. So, our initial response was to join the pay-to-play bandwagon and experiment to grow our following and expand reach. Early results encouraged us to keep at it and we were gradually increasing our budget for social advertising. But Twitter’s buyout prompted us to reconsider and to ask who benefitted most from our ad dollars? It surely was not the communities we aim to serve.</p>\n<h3>How should Barr’s core value to center racial equity influence our decisions about where we engage and invest?</h3>\n<p>In 2021, Barr introduced a new core value to “center racial equity.” Across the foundation, we’ve been working to make that value concrete in our strategies, grantmaking, and how we do our work. As our team worked our way through this decision, that commitment got us asking how our choices would serve (or undermine) people of color and their experiences on social media - especially those targeted by hate speech. And we reached out to ask for perspective and advice. Across the board, our partners expressed concern over Twitter’s new direction, with several noticing an increase in hate speech in their feeds, more paid content, and loss of followers. One partner didn't mince words – Barr shouldn’t subsidize companies run by people incongruous with its values, they said. </p>\n<p>And we got clear about our decision. </p>\n<p>As a communications team at a mission-driven organization, our job is not just to find a megaphone that gets our message out. Because the communications tools we choose can either serve or harm the communities we care about most. It’s not just the message and the messenger – it's the method. And we are called to communicate in ways that are mission-advancing and values-aligned. Being open, listening, and being responsive to what best serves our mission, grantees, and partners is an important way we can demonstrate our values in action.</p>\n<h3>Let’s Stay Connected</h3>\n<p>As we wind down the time and attention we’re spending on Twitter, we are excited to have other avenues for people to stay connected and informed about Barr and our partners – ways that we’ve already seen more value from and that align better with our values. Here are two ways we encourage you to stay connected with us, and a survey to share your feedback and ideas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>LinkedIn:</strong> We’ve been growing our presence on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/barrfdn/\">LinkedIn</a> and we look forward to doing even more to build community there.</li>\n<li><strong>Email:</strong> We invite you to <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/#footer\">subscribe to our email list</a> to stay current on news from Barr and our partners with our quarterly newsletter and program-specific updates.</li>\n<li><strong>Survey:</strong> We’d love to hear about places you’re considering or already gathering online and how we can connect with you there. Please complete this <a href=\"https://form.asana.com/?k=D77TvRzbA_oDjJDxA38oTg&amp;d=1142825572013395\">short survey</a> to share that information with us as well as to offer feedback and ideas for our team.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We know firsthand this is not a simple decision lightly made. Over the years, we spent a lot of time and energy on Twitter. We built a following and a network of people we learned a lot from. And we created and contributed a lot of content we’re proud of. All that made it hard to contemplate a change - and is part of why we elected to pause and shift to listening mode, rather than exit. This also leaves open the option to ramp up our engagement, if big changes happen again, but in a positive direction. </p>\n<p>We also recognize that many people still find value in engaging with others on Twitter and contributing to communities that may not exist anywhere else – at least not yet. Everyone’s cost-benefit calculus is different and there is not one right path for moving forward. That’s why this decision was only for Barr’s institutional account (@BarrFdn). Some of our colleagues who’ve been personally active on Twitter will likely stay engaged in some fashion. We believe each person and organization should do what is right for them and the communities they value most. And we hope that sharing about our decision is helpful to others who are grappling with similar questions.</p>\n<p>Although where and how we communicate will certainly continue to evolve, we remain committed to our partners and our community, and we are excited to connect with you as we grow our digital strategy in other areas. </p>\n"

And last Friday, on the Boston Common—America’s oldest public park—I had the privilege of attending the much-anticipated unveiling of <a href=\"https://www.embraceboston.org/memorial\">“The Embrace,”</a> Boston’s newest public monument. </p>\n<p>As a tribute to Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King, who met and fell in love when they were students in Boston in the 1950s, The <a href=\"https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/hTaWxpJIGgjX27m81xU9OM3bo-I=/1440x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/6H6Z24AOP46L2XFLBFSZRHZBC4.JPG\">Embrace sculpture takes inspiration from a photograph of the couple</a>, in an embrace, moments after learning Dr. King had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>\n<div class=\"Media -aside -left\"> <div class=\"Media-imageWrapper\"> <img alt=\"People watch the embrace unveiling in Boston. \" class=\"Media-image\" src=\"https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/4297/crop_preview.jpg?1673965390\"/> <div class=\"FancyAttribution\"> <p>Jim Canales</p> </div> </div> </div>\n<p>In this history-steeped city (and many others the world over), public sculptures more commonly feature solitary heroic figures – usually men, typically white, often armed and on horseback. Artist <a href=\"https://hankwillisthomas.com/\">Hank Willis Thomas</a>, speaking to The Boston Globe’s Murray Whyte last September, reflected on growing up in Washington D.C. surrounded by such sculptures: “What always struck me was that all these memorials were related to war and violence,” he said. “But none of them were about love.” </p>\n<p>That insight inspired Willis’s artistry. The Embrace is all about love – and not solely of the romantic sort. Though it certainly captures a loving moment between the Kings, it also evokes their lifelong love and dedicated pursuit of justice, equity, and the “beloved community.” It also reminds us that achieving those aims is the work of decades and generations and extends far beyond the reach of any singular hero.</p>\n<p>As we enter this new year, I draw inspiration from the themes represented by The Embrace: the power of love, the centrality of partnership, and our ongoing quest for an equitable society. </p>\n<p>These are the themes that continue to animate our work at Barr. Much as we have sought to continue our work unabated throughout a global health pandemic, this year will offer us opportunities to be together—in person—as a Barr community and with our partners as we advance shared aspirations and deepen our abiding commitment to invest in potential.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow, our staff will gather for our first offsite since 2019, and we are also excited for a collective learning journey this coming spring to Montgomery, Alabama, to visit the Equal Justice Initiative’s <a href=\"https://museumandmemorial.eji.org/\">National Memorial for Peace and Justice and Legacy Museum</a> (this trip was originally planned for Spring 2020, as I wrote <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/barr-equity-journey\">here</a> three years ago this month). </p>\n<p>As we begin our work in 2023, I’m pleased to report that Barr’s trustees approved an increase in our grantmaking budget for 2023, to just over $150 million. This is despite a significant downturn in our assets, as experienced by most endowed institutions in 2022. This will represent the largest grantmaking budget in Barr’s history. </p>\n<p>Derived from the Greek, the word “philanthropy” literally means love of humankind. But, as Dr. King rightly observed, love alone does not suffice: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“Power without love is reckless and abusive, and love without power is sentimental and anemic. Power at its best is love implementing the demands of justice, and justice at its best is power correcting everything that stands against love.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This relationship between love and power is critical to understanding what transformative change requires. If we miss that, we risk diminishing all that the Kings, by their example, and The Embrace, in its newly-unveiled beauty, call upon each of us to do. </p>\n<p>For our part at Barr, we remain committed to ensuring that our philanthropic resources—rooted in love—are directed in ways that build the power that leads to justice. </p>\n"

Lisette served for four years as Executive Director of the <a href=\"https://www.vietaid.org/\">Vietnamese American Initiative for Development</a> (VietAID) in Boston’s Fields Corner neighborhood. She was Executive Director of the <a href=\"https://mavotertable.org/\">Massachusetts Voter Table</a>. Prior to that, she was a field and political coordinator for <a href=\"https://www.righttothecity.org/\">Right to the City</a> – a national alliance focused on collective action “to build democratic, just, and sustainable communities.” Lisette started her career with Boston’s <a href=\"https://cpaboston.org/\">Chinese Progressive Association</a> and most recently was a principal with <a href=\"https://www.kittlemansearch.com/\">Kittleman &amp; Associates</a>, a nonprofit executive search firm.</p>\n<p>“Throughout her career, Lisette has brought a deep respect for the communities she has served and a keen focus on driving change,” said Jim Canales, Barr’s president. “Her skills, experiences, and approach all align to what we sought in a leader for Barr’s Racial Wealth Equity initiative.

We applaud Ford, and especially its president, Darren Walker, for his visionary leadership and sustained commitment to the arts.</p>\n<p>Ford’s announcement is two-fold, with both national and regional components. First, in partnership with several other funders, 20 Black, Latinx, Asian, and Indigenous arts organizations will receive a total of $81 million. While Barr is not part of the national initiative, our co-founders, Barbara and Amos Hostetter, personally committed $10 million.

Ford’s $5 million grants for each region will require a 1:1 match from local funders, so for each region, lead funding partners have also been identified. The seven regions (and funding partners) are: Chicago (John D. &amp; Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Joyce Foundation, and Terra Foundation for American Art), Houston (Houston Endowment), Los Angeles (Getty Foundation, The Ralph M. Parsons Foundation), Massachusetts (Barr), Minnesota (McKnight Foundation), Philadelphia (William Penn Foundation), and Pittsburgh (Heinz Endowment).</p>\n<p>Each of the regional partners is committed to developing programs tailored to their unique context, assets, and challenges. </p>\n<p>We are delighted to partner with Ford on this critically important work for Massachusetts, and Ford and Barr have each committed $5 million to this effort. Importantly, Barr’s $5 million commitment, authorized by our trustees last week, will be <em>above and beyond</em> our regular arts grantmaking, so this represents a significant expansion of Barr’s ongoing commitment to the arts.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"Pullquote\"> <p>The core pillars of the Massachusetts effort will be multi-year general operating support and capacity building efforts for Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) arts organizations and artists in Massachusetts.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>The core pillars of the Massachusetts effort will be multi-year general operating support and capacity building efforts for Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) arts organizations and artists in the Commonwealth – to enable them to weather the COVID-19 pandemic, and to emerge from it even stronger. To do this work well is not simply a matter of making a set of one-time grants, but requires thoughtfulness and partnership, balanced with an understanding of the urgency of the current challenges organizations and artists are facing. We will develop our initial approach this fall and have more details to share in the coming months.   </p>\n<p>We look forward to building and deepening our partnership with BIPOC arts organizations and artists in the coming years. </p>\n"

Both this year and last represented all-time highs in grantmaking for the Foundation. </p>\n<p>While we have steadily grown our grantmaking these past several years, and are proud of the important work these resources have supported, we are also cognizant that Barr’s contributions will always be modest relative to what lasting impact requires. That reality makes one of our core values—take the long view—all the more relevant.</p>\n<p>For Barr, that core value in action means that we strive to be an engaged partner, investing in work for the long term, building deep and meaningful relationships with our partners, and acknowledging that addressing big challenges requires sustained commitment with a\nwillingness to take risks.</p>\n<p>In this, my final post of 2022, I wanted to share some exciting updates related to one of Barr’s newest initiatives - focused on reducing the racial wealth gap in Greater Boston - and how they reflect this long-term view and abiding commitment to impact. </p>\n<p>I introduced <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/closing-the-racial-wealth-gap\">Barr’s Racial Wealth Initiative</a> this past June. Since then, we have awarded almost $15 million in grants to an inaugural cohort of 15 partners. These organizations are at the heart of efforts to advance racial wealth equity in Greater Boston. Barr’s initial investments of flexible multi-year support for their program and operations were informed by conversations with leaders in the field, through a listening tour we conducted in 2021. </p>\n<p>Our grants focus on three broad areas: (1) strengthening core organizations advancing programs and policy; (2) investing in data and research; and (3) elevating the role of narratives as a means to broaden understanding and enable community dialogues around racial wealth equity. </p>\n<p>These grants represent only the beginning of Barr’s work in this area. One of the most resonant findings from our listening tour was how disruptive it can be, and how much risk it introduces, when funders’ interests and commitments prove fleeting. Barr’s commitment is not that. </p>\n<p>The systemic and structural racism that created and perpetuate the racial wealth gap will not be undone in a single grant cycle or time-horizon of a multi-year initiative. Advancing racial wealth equity requires honest dialogue, patient capital, authentic partnership, hard work, and – perhaps above all else – deep and abiding trust in those closest to the solutions.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"Pullquote\"> <p>Advancing racial wealth equity requires honest dialogue, patient capital, authentic partnership, hard work, and – perhaps above all else – deep and abiding trust in those closest to the solutions.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Taking the long view of this, here are three grants we awarded this fall precisely because they lay further groundwork for the long-term work ahead:</p>\n<p>First, with a three-year grant of $1,000,000, we are supporting the launch of a new project of <a href=\"https://www.bostonindicators.org/\">Boston Indicators</a> at The Boston Foundation, called, <strong>The Racial Wealth Gap and Economic Security Research Initiative.</strong> This new effort will build a robust and trusted source of information about the economic well-being of the greater Boston community. A new online resource center will make it easy to find the most current research on the racial wealth gap. The Boston Indicators team will also partner with outside experts on new research featuring promising solutions for closing the racial wealth gap and expanding economic security.</p>\n<p>Second, with a 15-month grant of $750,000 to <strong>The Boston Globe</strong>, we are providing seed support to an ambitious new effort to elevate and amplify stories, research, and data about racial wealth equity in Greater Boston. Building on the Globe’s 2017 Spotlight series “Boston. Racism. Image. Reality,” which was a Pulitzer Prize finalist and helped catalyze a city-wide conversation about racism in Boston, this new effort will deepen, expand, and further that conversation, with a dedicated team focused on journalism specifically about the racial wealth gap in Greater Boston. </p>\n<p>Third, with our largest grant to date for this initiative, a three-year grant of $2,000,000, we are supporting <a href=\"https://www.ujimaboston.com/\">The Boston Ujima Project</a>, a nationally-recognized leader in community wealth building. Ujima is unique in that it has integrated innovative solutions to community and generational wealth building into a single ecosystem focused solely on serving Greater Boston. This grant will provide Ujima with core operational support over multiple years as it continues to expand its efforts, allowing it to further design, test, and innovate new strategies that target the racial wealth gap and advance outcomes for Boston’s low-income residents.</p>\n<p>Barr’s efforts to advance racial wealth equity are in the early stages. In 2023, we will also appoint a director for this new initiative. Together with a growing network of partners, the director will shape the further trajectory of this important work. We do not bring pre-conceived answers to this immense challenge, nor do we believe that there is a single solution that will solve the racial wealth gap. What we do know with conviction is that by engaging leaders on the front lines in authentic partnership and by bringing a long-term perspective to the work, the promise of forward progress is heightened. We are excited about the year ahead and look forward to reporting on our learning and impact. </p>\n"

      "Field2": "\n\n<p>The deadliness of white supremacy revealed itself again this past weekend in Buffalo with the cold-blooded murder of ten innocent Black Americans. These were people going about their daily business who had their lives ended so abruptly, so atrociously, so senselessly.</p>\n<p>How often must we repeat this loop of violence and mayhem? </p>\n<p>How many more racially-motivated mass shootings can we endure? </p>\n<p>How much longer do we permit cable news hosts, social media platforms, and the voices of our own elected politicians to fuel and enable such hatred, rooted in pure racism and debunked conspiracy theories? </p>\n<p>When do we finally conclude that enough is enough?</p>\n<p>I have no pretense that this will be the last incident of its kind nor do I believe that the predictable expressions of sadness—and the inevitable “thoughts and prayers”—will actually translate to real change. </p>\n<p>But what I do know with some certainty is that change starts with each of us—standing up, speaking out, and taking action.</p>\n<p>In our work at Barr, we have the great privilege of supporting many bold and effective partners who do the work of advancing change and centering racial equity. But, I know from my conversations with many fellow leaders of color that they are exhausted, overwhelmed, and tired, as they continue to bear the burdens of a culture of white supremacy each and every day. And while we welcome allyship and support, we also need everyone to act—and to do.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"Pullquote\"> <p>To dismantle racism, those of us in positions of power and privilege must step up.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>To dismantle racism, those of us in positions of power and privilege must step up. </p>\n<p>Consider these events in our country just over the past few weeks: we have now lost one million people to a health pandemic that has disproportionately affected people of color. The rights of women to have agency over their own bodies is at threat for the first time in close to 50 years. The violence on display in Buffalo is not isolated to that single horrific incident; it happens across our country, every day. Indeed, just last week in Dallas, three women were shot at an Asian-owned hair salon in an incident that is being investigated as a hate crime.</p>\n<p>This is a time for action. Statements of solidarity and expressions of concern separated from tangible action are insufficient. Any action, large or small, makes a difference: how we treat people, how we vote, where we spend our resources, how we spend our time. The list goes on and on. And with intentionality, clarity of purpose, and anchored in a commitment to dismantle racism, we can make a difference.</p>\n<p>But it needs all of us, taking those actions both large and small.</p>\n<p>Among those actions I take today is remembering the lives of those who were murdered this weekend in Buffalo. Here I share the names, faces, and stories of the innocent victims. </p>\n<p></p><div class=\"twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered\" style=\"display: flex; max-width: 550px; width: 100%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowtransparency=\"true\" class=\"\" data-tweet-id=\"1525850099720626183\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"twitter-widget-0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/embed/Tweet.html?creatorScreenName=BarrFdn&amp;dnt=false&amp;embedId=twitter-widget-0&amp;features=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%3D%3D&amp;frame=false&amp;hideCard=false&amp;hideThread=false&amp;id=1525850099720626183&amp;lang=en&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barrfoundation.org%2Fblog%2Fdismantling-racism-is-everyone-s-work&amp;sessionId=ef8733da9c50b47e57797dee4046ffa5e826ea3b&amp;siteScreenName=BarrFdn&amp;theme=light&amp;widgetsVersion=2615f7e52b7e0%3A1702314776716&amp;width=550px\" style=\"position: static; visibility: visible; width: 550px; height: 897px; display: block; flex-grow: 1;\" title=\"X Post\"></iframe></div> <script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script><p></p>\n<p>Today we grieve.

      "Title": "A Year That Changed Us All",
      "Field2": "\n\n<p>As I write this, the first COVID-19 vaccines are being administered across the country and around the world – a hopeful turn in a year full of challenges that few could have imagined.</p>\n<p>2020 began with promise and hope as we ushered in a new decade, but was soon upended by a global pandemic, to which we have already lost 300,000 lives. Each of these individuals was a family member, friend, colleague, and neighbor whose place at our holiday tables will be empty this year. We collectively mourn these deaths.</p>\n<p>Following a series of senseless murders, 2020 was also a year that brought heightened awareness and a renewed reckoning with centuries of structural racism and anti-Blackness in our country.</p>\n<p>These seminal events served as the backdrop for our work at the Barr Foundation in 2020. We listened carefully to our partners and sought to adapt and support them effectively, even as they were recalibrating what work was most urgent for them to do. We also identified new partners and allies to respond to the pandemic and to engage in the movement for greater racial equity and justice. </p>\n<p>If I were to name a single theme that characterized their efforts this year, it would be this: dedication. Our partners’ leadership and commitment to serve their communities has never been more evident. And, as this exceptionally challenging year winds to a close, if there is a single, final message from me and my colleagues at Barr, it is this: we extend our profound gratitude and deep respect to those we are honored to serve through our grantmaking and related efforts. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"Pullquote\"> <p>We extend our profound gratitude and deep respect to those we are honored to serve.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>And while we are certainly ready to put 2020 in our rearview mirrors, there have also been some silver linings, which will inform and strengthen our work into 2021 and beyond. To offer just a few examples, this year enabled us at Barr to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Affirm and accelerate our commitment to advancing racial equity, as <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/an-enduring-commitment-to-racial-equity\">I outlined here</a> in August. This builds on the diversity, equity and inclusion work we have been engaged in for several years, and which <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/barr-equity-journey\">I shared about</a> at the beginning of 2020. We are excited to advance new work in 2021 to demonstrate our commitment even more fully.</li>\n<li>Provide greater flexibility and support to our grantees in the context of the pandemic. In the days following our shift to remote work, we <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/a-message-to-our-grantees-on-covid-19\">described a series of steps</a> we had taken with our grantees to offer flexibility and to respond to an evolving context. These many practices remained in effect for the balance of the year and will be with us as we turn to 2021. We joined nearly 800 foundation colleagues across the country who <a href=\"https://www.cof.org/news/call-action-philanthropys-commitment-during-covid-19\">pledged</a> to center the needs of grantees during COVID-19. Many of these practices should become the norm and continue, even when the pandemic recedes.</li>\n<li>Commit in excess of $10 million to provide emergency support in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as to invest in front-line organizations serving immigrant communities and the Black community. Earlier this month, we announced that many of the grants we had awarded earlier this year were <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/barr-foundation-announces-4-15-million-in-new-grantmaking-centered-on-racial-equity\">extended for a second year</a>, with no additional paperwork, to recognize the ongoing needs in our communities, and the work of our partners to meet those needs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Continuing on the theme of the positive developments of 2020, we also welcomed six new colleagues to Barr, three of whom joined us just prior to our shift to remote work in mid-March: Adrian Jones, executive assistant and manager of board operations; Giles Li, senior program officer for the arts; and Pouya Shahbodaghi, enterprise applications manager in our IT department. Later in the spring, Lynn Harwell joined us as our <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/barr-foundation-names-lynn-harwell-as-vice-president-for-administration\">first-ever vice president for administration</a>, and just in the past few weeks, we have welcomed Rory Neuner, learning officer, and Dylan Everett, program associate in education. Barr is enriched by the broad experience and diversity represented by this group of colleagues, and we look forward to the opportunity to have others meet our terrific new staff members in the months ahead.</p>\n<p>Finally, as we look to 2021, I want to share an action taken by the Barr trustees earlier this month. As we reported at the <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/building-on-growth-as-we-enter-a-new-decade\">beginning of this year</a>, Barr has been engaged over the past several years in planning for future growth. Since I arrived at Barr in 2014, we have more than doubled our staff and our grantmaking has increased by more than 75%. </p>\n<p>In 2021, the trustees have authorized a grants budget of between $115-120 million. This represents a more than 25% increase from our grantmaking levels in each of 2019 and 2020. The vast majority of this increase will be directed specifically to our deepened commitment to racial equity across the foundation, and these additive resources will enable our program teams to support work that makes that commitment tangible. These new resources will also permit us to identify new partners as well as to refine and deepen work with existing partners – all toward the goal of advancing a shared commitment to racial equity.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"Pullquote\"> <p>The vast majority of this increase will be directed specifically to our deepened commitment to racial equity across the foundation.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>In the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder, philanthropy responded with many messages of support and urgency and a surge of new dollars. I wrote a blog post entitled “<a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/actions-words\">Actions &gt; Words</a>” – because I felt then - as I do now - that for any of this work to make a real difference in the quest for racial justice, it will require concerted action and consistent engagement. This is long-term work that mandates our sustained focus and investment of resources, and we remain committed to both. You’ll continue to hear from me on what actions we are taking to demonstrate our commitment.</p>\n"

      "Title": "Reflections on Joining Barr in an All-Remote Context",
      "Field2": "\n\n<p>Seven colleagues have joined the Barr Foundation since March 2020 when Barr’s offices closed and shifted to remote status due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They onboarded via Zoom, built working relationships through Barr’s online chat channels, and integrated into an organizational culture without ever leaving their homes.</p>\n<p>What was this unique experience like for our group of colleagues? “Weird would be an obvious word to describe it,” said Dylan Everett who joined the Education Team in the fall of 2020. “On top of learning how to do my job, I was learning how to work remotely.”</p>\n<p>Other colleagues had worked remotely before but were navigating virtual relationship-building, a new field of philanthropy, not to mention the uncertainty and stress inherent in the last two years. “One of the biggest challenges has been grappling with a tremendous amount of uncertainty both in work and personal life,” said Rory Neuner, who joined Barr as learning officer in the fall of 2020. Lynn Harwell, vice president for administration, recalled, “I started part time in May 2020 and planned to fully onboard when the office reopened. Jim and I joke about that because we thought the transition was only a few weeks away. June 2020 became July, then September, January, and now it’s March 2022.”</p>\n<p>After two years of working fully remote, Barr has begun the process of reopening its physical office in order for us to collectively build what a hybrid work model looks like for the organization. We aim to start a new chapter in the organization’s history, <a href=\"https://www.2022barrfoundation.org/\">reimagining how we work</a> together and decisively not going back to the way things were (as Barr’s president, Jim Canales, has stated in <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/reimagining-philanthropy-commitment-to-racial-equity\">previous blog posts</a>). </p>\n<p>As we enter this new chapter, we want to share what we are learning, and via this blog post, to capture the voices and experiences of our colleagues who joined the organization in an all-remote context. The group recently came together via Zoom to share their experiences and takeaways with one another in a conversation facilitated by Jim. Below are some themes and excerpts from the virtual discussion.</p>\n<h3>Culture Is Built and Shaped by People</h3>\n<p>Without having stepped foot in the office, colleagues reflected on how they were still able to experience and recognize Barr’s culture. It showed up through interactions with other staff, through the onboarding process, and how all of those experiences made them feel.</p>\n<p>“What I've learned from having worked at a company with an office and for a fully remote organization is that being in person or remote is not the arbiter of whether or not you have a good culture,” said Kathryn Wright, senior program officer for clean energy, who joined Barr in January 2022. </p>\n<p>“Barr’s culture was able to, in some ways translate very well in terms of being remote because of the intentionality in the onboarding process, relationship-building, and policy design. There's definitely an emphasis and a focus on remembering that we're humans too,” said Lynn. </p>\n<p>“At Barr, there's more support than I've ever experienced in a workplace,” said Najah Casimir, program officer for Mobility, who joined Barr in the fall of 2021. “Yes, some of that comes with our financial resources, but it's more so part of the culture of support for each other as people.”</p>\n<p>During the conversation, the group recognized that they collectively represent a significant portion of the Barr staff. “If the people on this Zoom screen do something different, Barr will be different. I'm very curious and excited about what that means and how Barr will look going forward—how we will honor the history and tradition and also bring new things to bear on the work,” said Rory. </p>\n<h3>Intentional Onboarding Was Key</h3>\n<p>Another theme from the conversation was appreciation for the thought and time that went into designing colleagues’ first few weeks at the organization. The Barr onboarding process, led by Barr’s operations manager, Jaime Lopez, in partnership with individual managers, includes a series of learning sessions and time to connect with colleagues. </p>\n<p>“I felt like the onboarding process at Barr was intentional about making sure personal connections were happening, so I really appreciated that,” said Kathryn.</p>\n<p>“Barr has really done a great job of what Kathryn was saying about the onboarding process. It's been wonderful having those connections established right away and feeling supported,” added Jules Faña, who joined Barr in the fall of 2021 as communications coordinator. “That support has been great in feeling like the job is a little bit less overwhelming to take on and learn.”</p>\n<p>“I agree,” added Julie Rosen, senior accountant, who joined Barr in the summer of 2021. “Having virtual lunches and meet and greets with staff helped build rapport with people, so that when I eventually met them in person, I felt more connected and familiar with all the teams.”</p>\n<h3>Self-Discovery and Self Care</h3>\n<p>Many Barr colleagues reflected on what they learned about themselves through this experience, including how to prioritize and ask for what they need. </p>\n<p>“I've gotten better at asking for help, which is not something I really did in the past. I would sort of brute force my way through a problem if I ran into one,” said Dylan.</p>\n<p>“This experience reinforced my strengths and showed that I am pretty comfortable with ambiguity and the need to be flexible,” added Lynn. “I also realized that those things may not be easy for everyone and it’s important to have empathy and be able to really look and understand someone else's perspective and point of view.”</p>\n<p>“We've gotten to see a little window into people's lives. I think that has given us a lot more ability to speak up and say, ‘this works better for me.’ I’m able to do my work being seen fully as who I am,” said Rory.</p>\n<p>“It’s not just the COVID pandemic, there have been a lot of things happening in our society since I joined Barr. There was a day when the news was especially overwhelming and I found it hard to function. I went into ADP and logged my health leave for the rest of the afternoon. That was a really big deal as a person who has never used sick leave in my entire life” said Najah.</p>\n<h3>Building Relationships Was Challenging But Happened in Different Ways</h3>\n<p>A main topic of discussion centered on building relationships, both internally as new staff wanted to get to know colleagues, and externally especially for those staff who engage with grantees and other partners.</p>\n<p>“I feel like at times it has been a challenge for me to build more personal relationships and allow colleagues to get to know me beyond the realm of accounting,” said Julie. “Most of the time, my communication is limited to bothering people about budgets or expenses, so I love the opportunities that Barr offers for us to interact outside of that. Whether it is through events planned by the Fun Committee, chatting on Teams, or participating in team challenges like WalkBoston’s Beat the Bay State, it is nice to catch a glimpse into people’s lives outside of work.” </p>\n<p>“It's been an interesting and different way to make connections,” commented Dylan. “At one point I had only met four Barr colleagues in person, and none of them were members of my team. But, I still felt like I knew my teammates. We find time on Teams to just talk back and forth and everyone's making the most of what they can with the situation.”</p>\n<p>“I'd say building relationships with grantees in the virtual environment is a challenge. I’ve been thinking a lot about how to, in a virtual setting, build strong relationships that are rooted in trust,” said Najah.</p>\n<p>“There is a learning curve for figuring out different ways to show up on digital platforms and ways to really connect with people in a virtual sense,” said Jules. </p>\n<p>“I’ve gotten used to engaging and meeting many people virtually this past year and a half, so that when I finally meet them in person, it’s a normal experience (not awkward). It actually feels the same because I have given trust and been vulnerable and shared things,\" said Lynn. “I've had to feel comfortable doing that as a black woman coming into an organization. I have no choice but to try to trust all of you. So that's what I'm working on. And I think that's allowed me to make connections.”</p>\n<h3>Advice for Hybrid Work</h3>\n<p>In the spirit of collectively figuring out what hybrid work looks like at Barr, the conversation closed with Jim asking colleagues for advice. “What should we be thinking about as Barr transitions to a hybrid of office, field, and remote work?”</p>\n<p>“There are going to be times when we are in the office and times when we're not. So, we really have to try to treat people who are working from home on a given day, at the same level. And, give it the intentionality, space, and the time needed for it to be a good experience no matter where you're working,” reflected Kathryn. </p>\n<p>“I think Zoom is beautiful for accessibility. As somebody who facilitates meetings, I’ve found it's so hard to do hybrid. We have to think about how we balance the tension between accessibility and connectedness,” said Rory. </p>\n<p>Lynn offered a final reflection, “I think we have to work through the hardest pieces and then learn as we go through it. We have to be open and honest about what’s working for us as we experience it.” </p>\n<p>I have great appreciation for my colleagues for being open and honest during this conversation.

      "Title": "Five Questions with Barr's New VP of People and Talent",
      "Field2": "\n\n<p><strong>You joined Barr Foundation as a human resources consultant in 2021. What led you to Barr Foundation?</strong> </p>\n<p>I’d been an independent consultant for over 20 years. I had worked with one of Barr’s education grantees and was familiar with the reach of Barr’s impact. So, when the call for a consultant to work directly with Barr crossed my path, I was thrilled about the opportunity. It felt like a natural fit. Our relationship began like many of my previous consultant engagements. Barr brought me in to support them in developing their HR growth plan. At the time, one person (Denise Gillespie) was responsible for all the functions related to human resources, talent acquisition, and support across both Pilot House and Barr. With Barr having experienced significant growth in recent years, it was clear that the HR role was fast becoming more than a one-person job. Through the consulting assignment, I worked with leadership to scope new roles and identify how to expand capacity thoughtfully.  </p>\n<p><strong>In October of 2023, you accepted the full-time role as Vice President, People &amp; Talent. What inspired your decision to commit to a more permanent position within Barr?</strong> </p>\n<p>Before committing to a permanent position within Barr, I worked for a year as a consultant and an additional year as the interim Vice President of People and Talent. During two years, I recognized that Barr could be a place where I could grow, learn, and help create new possibilities for an impactful organization. Additionally, I had formed deep relationships that made me feel strongly connected to the Barr community and culture. Given that the pandemic had so profoundly disrupted how and where people worked, navigating new HR challenges also felt like an exciting next professional chapter. We had a unique opportunity to create something entirely new: a way of working that centers trust and flexibility. All of this could be designed with an eye toward retaining and supporting exceptional talent in the workplace. I couldn’t imagine a better opportunity for a personal career transition.   </p>\n<p><strong>What engages you most about the work?</strong> </p>\n<p>At Barr, we have an incredible opportunity to impact the region’s most challenging issues. We want to support passionate, engaged, and humble leaders in every area of Barr’s work. The culture at Barr supports leading with curiosity and openness. I believe this is what creates a high care and high performing organization. I appreciate that we’ve committed to learning as we go; we iterate, learn, and adjust. I value how we engage with every staff person, candidate, and partner as the expert of their own experience and domain. At Barr, we ground our work in a commitment to advancing racial equity and carry that commitment through our HR processes. We explore with candidates how their lived experiences might support what they bring to their role at Barr. We know that living out this commitment in our own talent development will ensure we can attract, retain, and develop talent from a variety of backgrounds. That’s what People &amp; Talent at Barr is all about.  </p>\n<p><strong>You’ve supported people and talent resourcing across diverse industries for over two decades. What advice can you offer to people who are seeking roles in philanthropy or the social impact arena?</strong> </p>\n<p>Roles in philanthropy and the social sector require possibility creators, people who are mission based, deeply care, and are incredibly capable with big hearts backed by a humble ambition. It’s also helpful to take the long view. Work in this arena requires patience and persistence. At Barr, specifically, our grantees’ missions are ambitious and vital. It’s helpful to be creative, strategic, and committed to relationship building. It’s equally helpful to be comfortable with ambiguity and willing to nimbly adjust as new opportunities develop.   </p>\n<p><strong>At Barr, we work to build a brighter New England. On a more personal level, where is your favorite place in New England and why?</strong> </p>\n<p>My favorite place in New England is my adopted hometown of Duxbury, MA. Although I grew up in Chicago, I live and have raised my family on the south shore in Duxbury. Our community has both a working waterfront (with oyster farmers and a thriving fishing industry) and is a summer beach oasis. It has always felt like the perfect combination of history, natural beauty, and the earth’s bounty. It's pretty special to me.</p>\n"

      "Field2": "\n\n<p>Last week, Jim Canales and I had the opportunity to contribute to <a href=\"http://www.ssireview.org/making_ideas_move\">“Making Ideas Move.”</a> The blog series, co-sponsored by the <em>Stanford Social Innovation Review</em> and <a href=\"http://www.comnetwork.org\">The Communications Network</a>, explores how effective communications has helped foundations, nonprofits, and other organizations drive change.</p>\n<p>Drawing on recent research commissioned by The Communications Network, Sean Gibbons, the Network’s executive director, <a href=\"http://www.ssireview.org/making_ideas_move/entry/making_ideas_move\">opened the series</a> in January with the hypothesis that communication makes the greatest contribution “when an organization’s brand, culture, strategy, and action are aligned.” Each week since then, new posts from a diverse group of leaders of foundations, nonprofits, and research institutions have explored what that looks like in practice—and how communications has enabled them to “make their ideas move.” Here is a recap of the series thus far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In <a href=\"http://www.ssireview.org/making_ideas_move/entry/bold_but_flexible_how_to_effectively_share_your_vision\">“Bold but Flexible: How to Effectively Share Your Vision,”</a> Risa Lavizzo-Mourey and Fred Mann discuss how the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation communicates about its vision in ways that draw in both allies and unusual suspects.</li>\n<li>In <a href=\"http://www.ssireview.org/making_ideas_move/entry/meeting_people_where_they_are\">“Meeting People Where They Are,”</a> Daniella Gibbs Leger, senior vice president for communications at The Center for American Progress, reflects on how dedicating more than fifty percent of the organization’s operating budget to communications and outreach—and fully integrating communications across the organization—has enabled the Center to reach the broadest possible audience. </li>\n<li>In <a href=\"http://www.ssireview.org/making_ideas_move/entry/the_new_communications_imperative\">“The New Communications Imperative,”</a> Andrew Sherry, vice president/communications of The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, makes the case that “communications is not just an opportunity for nonprofits; it’s a necessity.”</li>\n<li>In <a href=\"http://www.ssireview.org/making_ideas_move/entry/the_chief_engine_of_change_conversation\">“The Chief Engine of Change: Conversation,”</a> Evan Wolfson and Kevin Nix of Freedom to Marry explore the power of conversation to make what once seemed impossible now seem inevitable. </li>\n<li>“<a href=\"http://www.ssireview.org/making_ideas_move/entry/making_ideas_catch_on\">Making Things Catch On</a>” is a conversation between Sean Gibbons and Jonah Berger, Wharton School professor and author of <em>Contagious: Why Things Catch On</em>. They explore the science behind why things become popular, and how to make word of mouth work for social change.</li>\n<li>Drawing on lessons learned from several successful national campaigns, in <a href=\"http://www.ssireview.org/making_ideas_move/entry/big_communications_for_small_nonprofits\">“Big Communications for Small Nonprofits,”</a> Next Generation President and CEO Matt James argues that strategic communications can deliver outsized impact even without huge budgets or headcount—so long as leaders “develop and constantly reinforce an internal culture that values effective communications.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our piece, <a href=\"http://www.ssireview.org/blog/entry/creating_a_communications_culture\">“Creating a Communications Culture,”</a> picks up where James leaves off on the topic of culture. In it we offer three guiding principles we have used at Barr—mission alignment, leadership buy-in, and outside wisdom—to foster a culture that embraces a more central and ambitious role for communications.</p>\n<p>We look forward both to following and engaging in this continuing conversation and to future opportunities to share about what we are learning. And, as always, we welcome <a href=\"mailto:communications@barrfoundation.org\">your feedback</a>. </p>\n<h4>Hear from Jim Canales on opportunities for foundations to use their voice:</h4>\n<div class=\"Media -full\"> <div class=\"u-fluid-iframe\"> <div class=\"u-fluid-iframe-inner\"> <iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" data-ready=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/268616916?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0\" title=\"Video: Opportunities for Foundations to Use their Voice\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\"> <a href=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/268616916?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0\">A video on Vimeo</a> </iframe> </div> </div> </div>\n<div class=\"PersonFeature u-mt4 u-mb4\"> <div class=\"PersonFeature-image u-mb2\"> <img src=\"https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/crop/335/original.jpg?1529007723\"/> </div> <div class=\"PersonFeature-bio\"> <p><strong>Making Ideas Move</strong>, presented in partnership with <a href=\"http://www.comnetwork.org\">The Communications Network</a> and the <em><a href=\"http://www.ssireview.org\">Stanford Social Innovation Review</a></em>, is a blog series on how effective communication has helped foundations, nonprofits, and other organizations drive social change. </p> <p>Articles address the purpose and impact of strategic communications, what it takes to improve communications, how to foster a culture of communications, the power of a nonprofit brand, and other tools and approaches organizations use to maximize communications and make their ideas move.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/moveideas?f=realtime&amp;src=hash\">#moveideas</a></p> </div> <ul class=\"PersonFeature-links u-mt2 no-print\"> <li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/@ssireview \"><svg class=\"Icon\" height=\"48\" viewbox=\"628 -718 2048 2048\" width=\"48\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"> <path d=\"M2417.2-86.6c1.2,17,1.2,33.9,1.2,50.9c0,517.3-393.8,1113.4-1113.4,1113.4c-221.7,0-427.7-64.2-601-175.7 c31.5,3.6,61.8,4.8,94.5,4.8c183,0,351.4-61.8,485.8-167.2c-172-3.6-316.2-116.3-365.9-271.4c24.2,3.6,48.5,6.1,73.9,6.1 c35.1,0,70.3-4.8,103-13.3C916.1,424.7,781.6,267.2,781.6,76.9c0-1.2,0-3.6,0-4.8c52.1,29.1,112.7,47.2,176.9,49.7 C853.1,51.5,784-68.4,784-204.2c0-72.7,19.4-139.3,53.3-197.5C1030-164.2,1319.6-9.1,1644.3,7.9c-6.1-29.1-9.7-59.4-9.7-89.7 c0-215.7,174.5-391.3,391.3-391.3c112.7,0,214.4,47.2,285.9,123.6c88.4-17,173.3-49.7,248.4-94.5c-29.1,90.9-90.9,167.2-172,215.7 c78.7-8.5,155.1-30.3,225.3-60.6C2560.2-211.4,2493.6-142.4,2417.2-86.6z\"></path> </svg> Twitter</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.ssireview.org/making_ideas_move\"><svg class=\"Icon\" height=\"48\" viewbox=\"0 0 48 48\" width=\"48\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M39.2,13.6c0-2.3-0.9-4.5-2.5-6.2c-3.3-3.3-9.1-3.3-12.3,0l-7.5,7.5c-3.4,3.4-3.4,8.9,0,12.3 c1.6,1.6,3.8,2.5,6.2,2.5c2.3,0,4.5-0.9,6.2-2.5c0.6-0.6,0.6-1.5,0-2c-0.6-0.6-1.4-0.6-2,0c-2.1,2.1-5.6,2.2-7.8,0.4l3-3 c2.3-2.3,6-2.3,8.3,0c1.1,1.1,1.7,2.6,1.7,4.2c0,1.6-0.6,3.1-1.7,4.2l-7.5,7.5c-2.3,2.3-6,2.3-8.3,0c-2.3-2.3-2.3-6,0-8.3 c0.6-0.6,0.6-1.5,0-2c-0.6-0.6-1.4-0.6-2,0c-3.4,3.4-3.4,8.9,0,12.3c1.7,1.7,3.9,2.5,6.2,2.5s4.5-0.8,6.2-2.5l7.5-7.5 c1.6-1.6,2.5-3.8,2.5-6.2c0-1.6-0.4-3.1-1.2-4.4l2.6-2.6C38.3,18.1,39.2,15.9,39.2,13.6z M34.7,17.7l-2.4,2.4 c-3.4-3-8.6-2.8-11.9,0.4l-2.8,2.8c-0.9-2.1-0.5-4.7,1.3-6.5l7.5-7.5c2.2-2.2,6.1-2.2,8.3,0c1.1,1.1,1.7,2.6,1.7,4.2 C36.4,15.1,35.8,16.6,34.7,17.7z\"></path></svg> Website</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/moveideas?f=realtime&amp;src=hash\"><svg class=\"Icon\" height=\"48\" viewbox=\"0 0 48 48\" width=\"48\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M39.2,13.6c0-2.3-0.9-4.5-2.5-6.2c-3.3-3.3-9.1-3.3-12.3,0l-7.5,7.5c-3.4,3.4-3.4,8.9,0,12.3 c1.6,1.6,3.8,2.5,6.2,2.5c2.3,0,4.5-0.9,6.2-2.5c0.6-0.6,0.6-1.5,0-2c-0.6-0.6-1.4-0.6-2,0c-2.1,2.1-5.6,2.2-7.8,0.4l3-3 c2.3-2.3,6-2.3,8.3,0c1.1,1.1,1.7,2.6,1.7,4.2c0,1.6-0.6,3.1-1.7,4.2l-7.5,7.5c-2.3,2.3-6,2.3-8.3,0c-2.3-2.3-2.3-6,0-8.3 c0.6-0.6,0.6-1.5,0-2c-0.6-0.6-1.4-0.6-2,0c-3.4,3.4-3.4,8.9,0,12.3c1.7,1.7,3.9,2.5,6.2,2.5s4.5-0.8,6.2-2.5l7.5-7.5 c1.6-1.6,2.5-3.8,2.5-6.2c0-1.6-0.4-3.1-1.2-4.4l2.6-2.6C38.3,18.1,39.2,15.9,39.2,13.6z M34.7,17.7l-2.4,2.4 c-3.4-3-8.6-2.8-11.9,0.4l-2.8,2.8c-0.9-2.1-0.5-4.7,1.3-6.5l7.5-7.5c2.2-2.2,6.1-2.2,8.3,0c1.1,1.1,1.7,2.6,1.7,4.2 C36.4,15.1,35.8,16.6,34.7,17.7z\"></path></svg> Hashtag</a></li> </ul> </div>\n"

      "Title": "Welcoming New Barr Colleagues",
      "Field2": "\n\n<p>“Oh my, you’re so tall!” </p>\n<p>While not typically aimed at me (at least in recent memory), I have been enjoying hearing exclamations of that sort in our hallways and conference rooms (for me, it’s more often, “You’re so gray!”). It’s a happy consequence of increased in-person time in our offices, but it’s also a reflection of so many new faces at Barr.</p>\n<p>At Barr’s recent offsite gathering—our first in almost four years—I noted that more than a third of those in the room had joined us since our last offsite in 2019. I am devoting this blog post to introduce members of our expanded staff, and new ways current Barr team members are contributing. </p>\n<p>By way of context, Barr has been growing steadily since I arrived in May 2014 when our staff numbered 19. Today, there are over forty of us, with plans to add additional colleagues in the coming years. All along, we have aimed to be thoughtful about our growth, and one of our key partners in planning and executing all the work that such growth requires has been Denise Gillespie, who for many, many years was the sole human resources leader for both Barr and Pilot House Associates, Barr’s affiliated family office. </p>\n<p>I cite Denise to start because her valued efforts have so often been behind the scenes, and yet so critical to the effective recruitment and retention of Barr’s talented team. As we faced continued growth and a focus on talent development, we all determined that adding human resources capacity would best serve Barr’s mission and growing team (and grant-making) going forward.</p>\n<p>To that end, I am delighted to share that we have created a new leadership role of Vice President for People and Talent, dedicated entirely to Barr. This new VP will report to me and join me, Roger Nozaki, and Lynn Harwell providing leadership across the Foundation. </p>\n<p>I am also excited to introduce <strong><a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/pam-jensen\">Pam Jensen</a> as Interim VP for people and talent</strong>, effective January 1. </p>\n<p>With deep HR experience in the for-profit and nonprofit sectors, Pam supported Barr and Pilot House Associates as a consultant and advisor throughout 2022, as we worked to shape an HR strategy and plan for its implementation. Pam’s willingness to step in for a one-year interim assignment will enable us to move swiftly in advancing this vital area of Barr’s work, while also allowing time to shape plans for a permanent VP. </p>\n<p>Pam is joined by <strong><a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/maia-Tillotson\">Maia Tillotson</a>, whom we promoted in the fall to a new role of Human Resources Coordinator.</strong> This role, also fully dedicated to Barr, will provide much-needed support and guidance for our various teams across Barr, and we are thrilled to be able to promote one of our valued colleagues.</p>\n<p>We have several other new additions and changes to report:</p>\n<p>On Barr’s Education team, <strong><a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/natasha-ushomirsky\">Natasha Ushomirsky</a> has joined us as a Senior Program Officer.</strong> Since 2008, Natasha has worked with The Education Trust, a national nonprofit focused on research and advocacy for high academic achievement of all students – and also a Barr grantee. Most recently, Natasha led The Education Trust’s Massachusetts team, which convenes and facilitates the work of the Massachusetts Education Equity Partnership. </p>\n<p>In addition, <strong><a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/leah-bennett\">Leah Bennett</a> joined the Education team as Program Associate.</strong> Prior to Barr, Leah was Communications and Operations Manager at Saint Cecilia Parish (led by Reverend John J. Unni, a 2019 Barr Fellow). Leah will primarily support the Education Team’s <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/invest-in-educators\">Invest in Educators</a> and <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/build-public-will\">Build Public Will</a> portfolios – the latter of which Natasha will lead.</p>\n<p>To help us better serve our grantees, we expanded our grants management team with the addition of <strong><a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/joe-rodriguez\">Joe Rodriguez</a> as Grants Management Assistant</strong> – coming to us from Gateway Arts, a Brookline, Massachusetts studio art center, gallery, and store supporting meaningful lives and careers in art for adults with disabilities. </p>\n<p>To support our efforts to ensure Barr’s offices are welcoming, a fun place to gather, and a space to get good work done, <strong><a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/brit-vasconcellos\">Brit Vasconcellos</a> joined us in January as Office Management Specialist</strong> – a new role for Barr. Brit came from The RepTrak Company, where she was Senior Officer Operations Coordinator.</p>\n<p>On our communications team, <strong><a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/mary-chalifour\">Mary Chalifour</a> was promoted to the new role of Associate Director of Communications</strong>, acknowledging both her leadership as Interim Director during the prior year, and our ever-increasing ambitions for how strategic communications can help propel Barr’s mission.</p>\n<p>Most recently, we announced the appointment of <strong><a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/lisette-le-named-director-of-racial-wealth-equity-initiative\">Lisette Le</a> as Director of Barr's Racial Wealth Equity Initiative</strong>, and two new <strong><a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/categories/job-openings\">open searches on the Education Team</a></strong>. </p>\n<p>As we start 2023, we do so with anticipation that this year will bring us many more occasions to be together with our various partners, colleagues and friends. I look forward to having you meet our new colleagues (and reconnect with others). We are excited to welcome many of you back to our offices at Two Atlantic. </p>\n"

      "Field2": "\n\n<p>Eight people were murdered in Atlanta yesterday - six were of Asian descent. This is the latest and most violent tragedy in a year marred by a massive increase in anti-Asian violence. The group STOP AAPI Hate in February <a href=\"https://templatelab.com/stop-aapi-hate-report/\">reported</a> nearly 4,000 incidents since March 2020. </p>\n<p>Following the gruesome display of white supremacy, racism, and bigotry in Charlottesville in 2017, I took to this blog to assert “<a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/we-must-all-speak-out\">We All Must Speak Out</a>.” Public statements matter – so does silence. We at the Barr Foundation emphatically add our voice to those denouncing these heinous acts and anti-Asian violence.</p>\n<p>What is just as vital as what we speak out against is that we speak to our friends, families, neighbors and colleagues in the Asian and Asian American community – that they can know we see them and stand with them as partners to address the conditions that lead to such violence.</p>\n<p>All people deserve to live free of fear. Today, we speak out against this violence and to express our grief in solidarity with the families and loved ones of those whose lives were taken. And we speak for action, and for investing in leaders engaging our Asian and Asian American communities in determining solutions to assure they are respected, protected, safe, and supported.</p>\n"

Tracy’s initial three-year term as Trustee will commence September 1st. </p>\n<p>“Tracy brings a keen understanding of the nonprofit and philanthropic sectors,” said Barbara Hostetter. “Through her leadership of Social Finance, she is innovating approaches to financing social change efforts. And she brings to Barr deep experience in both nonprofit leadership and governance. We welcome Tracy to our board and look forward to her contributions.” </p><div class=\"Media -aside -right\"> <div class=\"Media-imageWrapper\"> <img alt=\"Tracy P High Res 2\" class=\"Media-image\" src=\"https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/crop/4993/square_crop.jpg?1686750099\"/> </div> <div class=\"Media-caption\"> <p>Palandjian Appointed Barr Trustee</p> </div> </div><p></p>\n<p>Headquartered in Boston, Social Finance is a national nonprofit that builds innovative partnerships and investments to measurably improve lives. Since 2011, the firm has pioneered impact-first investments including the Social Impact Bond and the Career Impact Bond to catalyze capital at scale and deliver sustainable impact for people and communities across the United States. Social Finance also builds impact-first investments for donor-advised funds and private foundations and has mobilized over $350 million  to deliver measurable outcomes in education, economic mobility, health, and housing. </p>\n<p>Six years ago, the Barr Foundation initiated a planned expansion of its board as part of a shift from a family foundation to a legacy foundation, as described in <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/from-family-philanthropy-to-a-legacy-foundation\">this 2017 blog post</a> by board chair and co-founder Barbara Hostetter. Tracy will become Barr’s ninth trustee, and the sixth from outside the family of our co-founders.</p>\n<p>Prior to Social Finance, Tracy was a Managing Director for eleven years at The Parthenon Group, where she established and led the Nonprofit Practice and worked with foundations and NGOs both in the U.S. and globally. A member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society, Tracy is a frequent speaker and writer on ESG and impact investing, social innovation, and results-oriented policymaking. She has served – and continues to serve - on numerous nonprofit and foundation boards, including the Harvard Corporation, the Surdna Foundation, Mass General Brigham, Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, and Facing History and Ourselves. </p>\n<p>“I am humbled and grateful for the opportunity to join Barr at this phase in its evolution,” said Palandjian. “The Foundation’s core values could not be more aligned with my own – to strive for impact, invest in leaders, and take the long view while being curious and open to new perspectives –  and to do so with a humility about the privilege inherent to philanthropic work. I am excited to contribute in any way I can to advancing Barr’s mission of investing in potential.”</p>\n"

      "Field2": "\n\n<p>Since a <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/welcoming-new-barr-colleagues\">February 2023</a> message from Barr President Jim Canales, we have welcomed several new colleagues at the Foundation. We wanted to introduce them all here – and also to acknowledge two colleagues assuming new roles. </p>\n<p>In May, <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/kelly-perkins\">Kelly Perkins</a> joined the Foundation’s IT team as Senior Business Solutions Analyst, having previously served in Senior and Business Analyst roles at Fidelity Investments and The Crosby Company, a family office in New Hampshire. </p>\n<p>Also in May, <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/andrea-prado-tuma\">Andrea Prado Tuma</a> joined Barr as Senior Learning &amp; Evaluation Officer, working primarily with Barr’s Education Program. For the previous six years, Andrea was a researcher at the RAND Corporation, after completing her Masters and PhD at Northwestern University, and several years designing and evaluating education programs at a nonprofit in Mexico City. </p>\n<p>Three new colleagues joined us in July: </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/cassandra-bruny\">Cassandra (Cassie) Bruny</a> joined as Program Associate for the Sector Effectiveness &amp; Learning and Evaluation teams. Previously, Cassie was admissions coordinator and graduate support associate at Our Sisters' School, a tuition-free, all-girls middle school in New Bedford, Massachusetts, where she also serves on the Scholarship Committee at SouthCoast Community Foundation. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/jess-rose\">Jess Rose</a> became Senior Program Officer on Barr's Education Team, leading the Catalyze New Models strategy, which aims to transform high schools across New England into places where all students thrive. Jess came to Barr after nearly two decades in public education in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Starting as a classroom teacher, she has been a leader at the school, district, and state level – most recently as Assistant Superintendent for Lincoln Public Schools (serving students from Lincoln, Boston, and Hanscom Air Force Base). </p>\n<p>Barr’s Education Team also welcomed <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/manjula-karamcheti\">Manjula Karamcheti</a> as Program Officer. Working with Jess on the Catalyze New Models strategy, Manjula brings over 20 years working in and for public schools in Massachusetts and nationally. Her specific experience includes high school counseling, district leadership, and higher education - where she focused on educator preparation and development.</p>\n<p>Cassie’s arrival allowed <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/john-dello-russo\">John Dello Russo</a> to pivot into a new role as Program Associate focused on Waterfront, Racial Wealth Equity, and Special Initiatives. A member of the Barr team since 2019, John initially worked solely with the Sector Effectiveness team, but soon took on increasing responsibilities supporting the Waterfront Initiative, Barr’s COVID-related grantmaking, developing and launching the Racial Wealth Equity Initiative, and supporting the Learning &amp; Evaluation team on various projects. </p>\n<p>Lastly, in October, <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/pam-jensen\">Pam Jensen</a> shed the “interim” from her title and was appointed Vice President, People &amp; Talent. Pam will continue providing in-house expertise fully focused on Barr and its evolving needs for all facets of the talent development pipeline. She brings to Barr over 20 years as a senior human resources executive and consultant, and deep experience in both the for-profit and nonprofit sectors. </p>\n<p>We look forward to opportunities you’ll have to meet and get to know these terrific colleagues. With open searches for a <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/hiring-digital-communications-manager\">Digital Communications Manager</a> and an <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/barr-seeks-administrative-assistant\">Administrative Assistant</a>, and a new Communications Officer joining us in November, we're excited about more introductions we'll be able to make in the months ahead. When new opportunities open up to join our team, we always post them here on Barr’s blog and on Barr’s <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/barrfdn\">LinkedIn</a>.</p>\n"

      "Title": "A Message to Our Grantees on COVID-19",
      "Field2": "\n\n<p>One of Barr’s principles is to serve as a constructive partner with our grantees. In this unprecedented time where social distancing must be the norm, communication with and support for our many partners becomes even more paramount. In that spirit, I wanted to share this important update on what steps we have taken at the Barr Foundation in light of COVID-19.</p>\n<h3>Our Operations will Continue Uninterrupted</h3>\n<p>Effective Friday, March 13, and for the foreseeable future, we have shifted the Foundation’s operations to all-remote work, and our offices at 2 Atlantic Avenue are closed to visitors. We have done this in order to adhere to the advice of public health experts to promote and support social distancing. For now, we have also cancelled all in-person events hosted at our office or convened by us through at least mid-April, and we have prohibited business travel for that period of time as well. </p>\n<p>In spite of this, and with thanks to our talented IT team, we are able to continue to do our work and to support our many partners in their work. My colleagues and I are all available to you, and we commit to responding to your messages and outreach. We have the technology for videoconferencing, and every colleague has the capacity to set up conference calls. I will provide ongoing updates on our website as circumstances evolve regarding our operations.</p>\n<h3>We’re Extending Support and Flexibility to Our Grantees</h3>\n<p>We are fully cognizant of the major implications that COVID-19 is having on the organizations we support, their own staff teams, and the people they serve. We also know that we are only starting to understand the longer-term implications.</p>\n<p>We aim to be flexible and responsive to our grantees’ needs, and at this time, we commit to the following steps in order to provide as much flexibility and support as we can to all of our grantees:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>We welcome a conversation about revisiting with you any grant objectives, timelines, and terms, in order to ensure that you can focus on more emergent needs at this time. We are open to exploring alternatives when the most prudent course is to delay or postpone plans altogether.</p></li>\n<li><p>We will be flexible with deadlines for grant reports or other deliverables. We are also open to alternative formats for such reports, such as taking them verbally, by phone or video conference. </p></li>\n<li><p>We commit to the timely release of grant payments given that our business operations are well-positioned to carry out those commitments.</p></li>\n<li><p>We can entertain requests to augment or accelerate approved grant payments, based on your individual circumstances.</p></li>\n<li><p>We understand that events and other large meetings or convenings that may be part of your grant with us are likely to be postponed or cancelled; we can work with you to explore implications, including how Barr funds allocated for those purposes can be used.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In all of this, your program officer serves as your main point of contact. You should reach out directly to that individual on any of these matters or others you may want to bring to our attention. We aim to serve as a constructive partner to you and to demonstrate the measure of flexibility and responsiveness that this moment demands of all of us. </p>\n<h3>Our Commitments are Unchanged</h3>\n<p>Our trustees approved a $95 million grantmaking budget for 2020. While our finances have undoubtedly changed significantly since that decision, we are committed to sustaining that level of grant support in 2020. Obviously, Barr’s specific plans for the use of those resources may evolve in view of COVID-19 and the implications for our partners, and we will keep you apprised. The key message we want to convey right now is our commitment to continue the level of support we had intended.</p>\n<h3>We are Engaging in Collective Efforts</h3>\n<p>We are staying closely connected to the emerging efforts to support the important steps being taken by our public sector partners and to explore ways that collaborative philanthropic activity can more efficiently and quickly direct resources to the most vulnerable amongst us. These discussions are occurring as I write this. As we learn more, and as we make decisions about our role in such partnerships, I will communicate those plans. </p>\n<h3>We are Committed to Taking Care of Each Other</h3>\n<p>As we live through this experience together, we do well to focus on those people who will face major challenges in this moment: populations with higher risk of exposure to COVID-19; our fellow citizens and residents whose livelihood are seriously compromised by this economic dislocation; and members of communities being vilified and targeted by racist actions, just to name a few. </p>\n<p>My friend and colleague, Grant Oliphant, president of the Heinz Endowments in Pittsburgh, wrote a typically thoughtful and moving <a href=\"http://www.heinz.org/blog-the-point/blog-detail/?id=70\">blog post</a> about the effects of COVID-19 in his community. It included this observation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“A moment like this can rob us of our sense of agency and power. However, I would argue that the path forward is to realize that we do have power, even in the face of something that makes us feel incredibly small, and that it lies where it always has—in remembering that we are in this thing together and in finding ways to embrace our collective responsibility and accountability to each other.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We at the Barr Foundation embrace this sense of responsibility and accountability to all of our partners, and, through our collective work, we aim to demonstrate the best of ourselves.</p>\n<h3>Resources</h3>\n<p>Many of our colleagues have assembled helpful resources. We recommend (suggested additions welcome and we will update):</p>\n<p><strong>For Nonprofits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>“<a href=\"http://massnonprofitnet.org/nonprofit-resources/coronavirus-massachusetts-nonprofits/\">Coronavirus and Massachusetts Nonprofits</a>” from the Massachusetts Nonprofit Network</li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.cof.org/news/news-updates-coronavirus-outbreak?_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8TfGIg_SFH3nbuYp-uHIvoO-AkEcTGnvXh47H8y0A-fFj_SffGIqlccpyVQqopNP0QwNtTS-MD6eHccfKsNyAEe9lobe9eCHvGAokQL_s_yf9eg_o&amp;_hsmi=84463655&amp;utm_campaign=2020%20General%20Communications&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=84463655\">News and Updates on the Coronavirus Outbreak</a>” from the Council on Foundations. </li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/nonprofits-and-coronavirus-covid-19\">Nonprofits and the Coronavirus</a>” from the National Council on Nonprofits. </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nefa.org/covid-19\">Resources for Artists &amp; Cultural Organizations</a> from the New England Foundation for the Arts.<br/></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>General Public Health Resources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.boston.gov/news/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-boston\">COVID-19) in Boston</a>” from the City of Boston. </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/resource/information-on-the-outbreak-of-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19\">Information on the Outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019</a> from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.<br/></li>\n<li>“<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html\">Coronavirus (COVID-19)</a>” from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/health-information/coronavirus\">Coronavirus (COVID-19) Resources</a> from the National Institutes of Health.</li>\n</ul>\n"

      "Field2": "\n\n<p>In their post last June (“<a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/barr-foundation-gpr-results\">Typical Isn’t Good Enough</a>”), Barr’s President and Vice President shared what we learned from, and how we intended to respond to our <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/impact-learning/grantee-perception-report\">2017 Grantee Perception Report</a> (GPR). The GPR is a confidential survey that invites nonprofits for feedback on what it’s like to work with their funders. </p>\n<p>With Yvonne Belanger, Barr’s Director of Learning &amp; Evaluation, I co-chaired a working group tasked with taking a fresh look at Barr’s grantmaking process. One of the first steps we took was to have all of our staff go through the process themselves. Walking a mile in our grantees’ shoes was an eye-opening experience. We found our process could be an unpleasant and difficult slog.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"Pullquote Pullquote--short\"> <p>Walking a mile in our grantees’ shoes was an eye-opening experience.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Guided by a working group made up of people from across the foundation, here are a few of the changes we’ve been working on:</p>\n<h4>We are asking fewer questions in our grant application.</h4>\n<p>We reduced the number of questions we ask in our grant application, and we have worked to eliminate redundancies, to sequence questions in a way that makes more sense logically, and to provide clearer guidance about length of responses.</p>\n<h4>We are moving away from requiring custom forms and attachments, and moving towards publicly-available data.</h4>\n<p>Our grant application required multiple forms of data as attachments. Yet, we recognize that nonprofits are increasingly publishing financial and other important information about their organizations at places like <a href=\"https://candid.org/\">Candid</a> (formerly GuideStar). Instead of asking grant seekers to assemble these documents for us (or to spend time translating their data into our unique forms), we are reworking our process and systems so that our team can assemble information ourselves from what is publicly-available.</p>\n<h4>We created a guide to help grantees define outputs and outcomes.</h4>\n<p>As a tool to help grant seekers in the proposal stage and also to make reporting more straightforward, we developed a brief <a href=\"https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/528/attachments/Barr_Grantee_Output_and_Outcomes_Guide_2023.pdf?1681485315\">guide to writing outputs and outcomes</a> that are simple, clear, and meaningful measures of progress and impact.</p>\n<h4>We continue to revise our grant-related communications to be less transactional and more human.</h4>\n<p>Going through our own application process, many staff were struck by how impersonal and transactional the communications were. Our emails and instructions focused on the steps to navigate our online system and how to troubleshoot IT issues. They were all very precise and accurate. Yet, as communications with real people we might partner with for years to come, they missed the mark. We had a team work through communications for every stage of our process, to make them more human.</p>\n<h4>We are working to be clearer about what to expect at each phase of the partnership.</h4>\n<p>One important lesson for us from our Grantee Perception Report was that our grantees sometimes felt uncertain about how much interaction to expect with us. We always hope to stay engaged and to be a resource to our grantees. Yet, the frequency and depth of interaction can vary. We have sought to be more explicit in both our written and verbal communications about what to expect at each stage of the relationship. In the grant application process, for example, this means every email and confirmation message now includes specific dates by which people can expect to hear from us next. We are also working to be clearer up front about our expectations for reporting and for their participation in evaluation activities.</p>\n<p>These are only a few of the changes we’ve been working on, and there’s more to come. For example, we will be striving to simplify our grant reporting requirements and renewal process, and are considering how to more frequently accept proposals and reports prepared for other funders. Additionally, we discovered different teams were approaching the same processes in different ways. To help us take these next steps and keep a focus on continuous improvement, we hired <a href=\"https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/prerna-sekhri\">Prerna Sekhri</a> as manager of program operations late last year. We are working to learn from each other and uncover new strategies for making our processes more streamlined, relationship-focused, and beneficial to our partners. </p>\n<p><em>How are we doing?
