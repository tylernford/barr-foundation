983,The Next Phase of Barr’s Racial Wealth Equity Initiative,"<p>Future grantmaking to focus on supporting partners advancing racial wealth equity through transforming systems, policy, and narratives</p>","<p>For my first year as director of Barr’s Racial Wealth Equity Initiative, my top priority was to listen, learn, and reflect on Barr’s early efforts and where the greatest opportunities are going forward.  I am excited to share what the next phase of work will look like. The overarching goal of Barr&#39;s racial wealth equity grantmaking is to transform systems, policy, and narratives to build wealth in communities of color. We will continue to focus on the Greater Boston region. Yet we are also open to learning about colleagues engaged in similar efforts in the Gateway City regions of Fall River, New Bedford, Lawrence, Lowell, Brockton, and Randolph.</p>

<p>This blog aims to share our key learnings and reflections from extensive conversations with nonprofit, philanthropy, and other community leaders (including our <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/three-themes-for-advancing-wealth-building-and-racial-equity"">listening series</a>); to provide a summary of our strategic focus areas for the initiative, and the approaches we intend to focus on with our grantmaking.</p>
<h3>Key learnings and reflections</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>We must continue to listen, learn, and trust.</strong> Our role is not to set the agenda or define the strategy but to start from a place of humility with the recognition that solutions come from those most effected. </li>
<li><strong>Progress requires stronger networks advancing change to infrastructure, policies, and systems</strong>. From across the field, we heard that real and sustained impact in people’s lives and in their communities requires strengthening networks of organizations working across silos (of issue, geography, or approach) to foster collaboration, and transform systems. </li>
<li><strong>We must also shift the ways people understand and talk about wealth equity</strong> with new narratives that include the inherent potential all people have, and the right all have to build wealth for their families and communities. Harmful and false narratives have historically placed blame on individuals – characterizing them as unmotivated, undisciplined, or in other ways unworthy, and have not acknowledged decades of disenfranchisement and policy (such as redlining) that have impacted whole communities. 
<blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--goal""> <p>overarching</p> </blockquote></li>
</ul>
<h3>Our next phase will focus on three strategic levers.</h3>
<p>We believe that over the next 10 years, Barr’s greatest contribution to advancing racial wealth equity will be to partner with organizations striving <em>to transform systems, policy, and narratives to build wealth in communities of color.</em> And while there are many approaches people use to address aspects of wealth creation, Barr will focus on three levers where we think we can be most helpful, and where we see high potential to influence systems, policy, and narratives: increasing access to capital, expanding community ownership, and advancing pathways to high-road jobs.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Increasing access to capital</strong>: Barr’s Racial Wealth Equity Initiative will support partners working to shift policies to make it more viable for people of color to become homeowners and entrepreneurs; and partners working to provide access to capital and mitigate financial challenges, in ways that can inform new policies and systems for individuals and community assets can be further developed within communities of color.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Expanding community ownership</strong>: We will support  partners working to explore new economic models; purchasing property committed to long-term community use and benefit; and organizing residents to advance novel approaches to community ownership.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Advancing pathways to high-road jobs</strong>: “High-road” jobs are those where employees have access to higher wages, predictable annual income, opportunities for advancement, and benefits such as health insurance and retirement. Through this strategy, we aim to support the “invisible workforce”—adults in communities of color who are either in low-wage jobs and/or could benefit from opportunities like workforce development and training to gain access to high-road jobs. We seek partners who are interested in innovative, culturally-competent workforce development to increase diversity within high-road industries. Given Barr’s Climate Program, we have a particular interest in the rapidly growing clean energy industry.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3>Grantmaking to focus on three approaches.</h3>
<p>Within these strategies, we will focus our grantmaking on efforts that incorporate one or more of the following approaches:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Advocacy and organizing</strong> to build and shift power. Systems change requires a shift in power structure so that policies and practices are reflective not only of the needs but aspirations of people of color. We seek partners who embed grassroots power building or advocacy in their work, or are invested in building these tools.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Network building</strong>. We believe that networks and coalitions are key to leveraging the strengths of individual organizations and advancing best practices and durable policy gains. We seek networks and coalitions that include varied perspectives and structures, such as nonprofit organizations, research/data providers, artists, and municipalities. We acknowledge that networks and coalitions take time to coalesce and build trust – especially where there’s a history of competition for funding and influence.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Narrative and strategic communications</strong>. This work also requires that we work to shift mindsets, deepen understanding of root causes and potential solutions, and inspire civic action. We seek partners who are poised to engage in strategic communications and narrative work as a key driver. <blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--new""> <p>need</p> </blockquote></p></li>

982,When Foundation Strategies Evolve,"<p>Barr’s VP for strategy and programs talks about Barr’s approach to shaping and evolving strategy, centered on Barr’s values.</p>","<p>In Jim Canales’s blogpost last week, “<a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/a-time-to-be-steadfast"">A Time to Be Steadfast</a>,” he noted that for us at Barr, the challenges and opportunities before us demand that we “hold tightly to mission, values and goals, but loosely to the strategies, tactics and approaches of any particular moment.”</p>

<p>We know that when foundations use words like “strategy review” or “strategy refresh,” it can raise concerns (and hopes!) and questions about what it means for organizations that receive their support. So as we’ve recently started to share strategy updates from our program teams (for example, “<a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/strategy-refresh-for-barr-foundation-mobility-work"">A Strategy Refresh for Barr’s Mobility Work</a>,” with more soon to come), I wanted to take a moment to be transparent about our approach, and to try addressing some of the fundamental questions that might arise: How does Barr even define “strategy”? What does it mean to “refresh” a strategy? Why are Barr teams making changes now? What are the implications for grantees?</p>
<h3>What does Barr mean by “strategy”?</h3>
<p>While Barr may be among the larger private foundations, our resources are still limited – especially in light of our goals and the complexity of the issues we work on. That means we face difficult trade-offs and hard decisions. That’s where strategy comes in. Strategies are the frameworks for planning and organizing our actions and resources to achieve our goals. 
<blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--Barr""> <p>does</p> </blockquote> 
In my view, the fundamentals of strategy are consistent across a range of fields and work, with three basic components:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>A clear, focused goal</em> that’s specific enough to decide what’s in and (perhaps even more importantly) what’s out.</li>
<li><em>Resources identified and aligned around the goal</em>. In philanthropy, we often think of grants as the primary resource. Yet we also consider <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/beyond-the-grant"">other resources we can bring</a> or enlist, such as relationships, convenings, technical expertise and assistance, learning and evaluation, and our voice and leadership. </li>
<li><em>Ways to gauge progress</em>, learn what’s working or not, assess changes in the context and conditions, and <em>use those insights</em> to adjust - whether through smaller course corrections or larger shifts in strategy.</li>
</ol>

<p>That general approach to strategy may be fairly universal. But at Barr, strategy work is of course also grounded in our <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/about#core-values"">core values</a>. We start with <strong>striving for impact</strong> and <strong>embracing risk</strong>. Where current policy and practice are not bringing us closer (or fast enough) to our goals, we must be willing to take risks on new ideas and approaches. Knowing we are striving to tackle complex and systemic issues, we take the <strong>long-term view</strong>, often framing goals and strategies for six years or longer.  </p>

<p>Just as importantly for us, strategy also requires <em>humility</em> and <em>relationships rooted in trust</em>. We know we need to develop strategies in collaboration with those actually doing the work. So we strive to listen to a range of perspectives, and to develop, assess, and evolve our work in partnership. <blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--we""> <p>know</p> </blockquote>We undertake research, <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/three-themes-for-advancing-wealth-building-and-racial-equity"">hold listening sessions</a>, and test our ideas with grantees and others in our fields. Importantly, we enlist our trustees in the process for their critical questions and insights that sharpen our thinking and ensure our continued alignment with Barr’s values, mission, and goals.</p>
<h3>Why is Barr now undertaking a number of strategy reviews?</h3>
<p>As Jim said, having a steadfast, long-term focus doesn’t mean inflexibility. Strategy is not a “set it and forget it” kind of task. Rather, we need to be asking constantly: What have we learned? What worked well? What didn’t work the way we intended or expected? What has changed in the larger environment? What new ideas or opportunities have arisen? What are our grantees telling us? And what are we hearing from others in the communities we aim to support?</p>

<p>Most of Barr’s current strategies were launched around 2016. Since then, Barr has grown, implemented new initiatives, invested in learning and evaluation, brought on new staff with fresh perspectives, and sought to center racial equity more explicitly in our work. Even more has changed in our fields, where new leaders have stepped up, we’ve endured a global pandemic, and new opportunities and challenges have arisen.</p>
<h3>What does this mean for current grantees?</h3>
<p>As we consider the shifts we need to make, the value we place on relationships remains central. We know that uncertainty and the prospect of change can raise questions for our partners and we strive to minimize that by keeping the lines of communications open. We strive to be transparent about the process we’re going through, where we land, and why. For individual grantees, this may translate to continued funding, new or different funding, or an end to support that may have been sustained over many years. In the cases where we are winding down our investments in certain aspects of work, we strive to help each organization continue their success and impact beyond Barr support.</p>

<p>Barr’s mission speaks to a dual role we seek to play - as “stewards and catalysts.” We aim to both nurture community assets and help advance new ideas in the field. To do this means we need to use our resources wisely and make sound decisions in the face of challenging tradeoffs and a constantly evolving context. This stewardship requires clear strategies, ongoing learning and reflection, close listening, and strong partnerships to guide how we continually evolve to meet the challenges before us. 
<blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--clear""> <p>requires</p> </blockquote>
We are keenly aware that any impact enabled by our resources is the direct result of the energy, dedication, and work of our partners.  Rooted in that understanding, we are committed to be open and transparent, and to work in partnership with those whom it is our privilege support. We look forward to sharing further updates in 2024 and always welcome your feedback and insights.</p>"
981,The Importance of Candid Feedback,<p>Barr’s VP of Strategy and Programs on why we seek (and share) grantee feedback on what it’s like to work with us.</p>,"<p>Every few years since 2003, Barr has participated in the <a href=""http://cep.org/"">Center for Effective Philanthropy (CEP)</a>’s Grantee Perception Report (GPR). The GPR provides a way for grantees to provide confidential, anonymous feedback to the foundations that support them. This spring, we are contracting CEP to once again conduct this survey with our grantees, and I wanted to provide some perspective on what the <a href=""https://cep.org/assessments/grantee-perception-report/"">GPR</a> is, why we participate, and how we use the results to guide our continuing efforts to be a better partner to our grantees.</p>

<p>Simply put, the GPR is a way for nonprofits to share honest feedback about what it’s like to work with their funders. The GPR has been honed through implementation with thousands of nonprofits and hundreds of foundations, and we have found it to be enormously helpful. It has enabled us to look critically at our practice, and to find concrete ways to be better partners.</p>

<p>To encourage candid feedback, CEP maintains complete confidentiality of grantee responses and provides an aggregate of the feedback for Barr. Importantly, CEP provides comparisons of that data with results from peer foundations. This comparative data helps us to understand the data in both absolute and relative terms. Survey questions probe grantee perceptions of a foundation’s transparency, communications, interactions, strategies, and impact. We have also asked CEP to include a small number of custom questions to help us get feedback on specific areas such as Barr’s focus on racial equity and the range of support we provide <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/beyond-the-grant"">&quot;beyond the grant”</a>.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--Barr""> <p>the</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>We take the survey results seriously.  As we have in the past, we will discuss the results as a staff and with our trustees, working to identify opportunities to build on what’s working and to identify ways for ongoing improvement. We also post the results publicly on our <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/impact-learning/grantee-perception-report"">GPR page</a>, including a summary of the steps we intend to take as a result of the feedback.</p>

<p>For the Barr Foundation, how we do our work is just as important as what we do. Surveys can never take the place of honest, open, ongoing dialogue that occur when relationships are rooted in trust and respect. It is always our aim to cultivate those kinds of relationships. Nonetheless, we believe the GPR is a valuable source of data to inform how we do our work. We are grateful to all who will dedicate the time to completing the CEP survey, and we look forward to sharing the feedback we receive.</p>"
980,A Time to Be Steadfast,"<p>A 2024 New Year’s message from Jim Canales, Barr’s president</p>","<p>The turn of a calendar year often stirs expressions of hope, optimism, and ambition. Yet, the dawn of 2024 just feels different. With all we’re contending with, and what we can see barreling towards us, 2024 already feels daunting: a presidential election poised to enflame polarization and consume our bandwidth; an accelerating climate crisis with remedies too few in number and too small in scale; continuing assaults on efforts to address the legacy of racism in our country. The list could go on.</p>

<p>This leads me to feeling some trepidation as we enter the year, especially for our partners and the significant challenges that may be in store for them. That has also led me to reflect on how Barr must show up with and for our partners this year.</p>

<p>The word I keep gravitating to is <strong>steadfast</strong>.</p>

<p>Despite these profound challenges, Barr’s mission, values, and aims demand that we – and our partners - remain steadfast. The word can mean fixed or immovable, but it also means <a href=""https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/steadfast"">“firm in belief, determination, or adherence. Loyal.”</a> It’s this latter definition that resonates most for me.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--values""> <p>mission</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>When the context shifts, when standing still or stepping back are not options we’re willing to entertain, what do we stand firm in? What are we determined about? What do we adhere to?</p>

<p>For the Barr Foundation in 2024, three answers rise to the fore: we remain steadfast in our commitment to center racial equity; steadfast in sustaining a long-term view; and steadfast in our gratitude to those we are privileged to serve.</p>

<p><strong>A steadfast commitment to center racial equity</strong></p>

<p>One of the early and unfortunate consequences of last June’s Supreme Court decision related to higher education admissions is that it has created a chilling effect. Many who previously took concrete action to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion, and to expand opportunities, have now paused, reconsidered, or even taken steps back.</p>

<p>Our position at Barr in the face of these potential challenges is to track what is changing (and what isn’t), to remain in close dialogue with our partners, and above all, to stay steadfast in our commitment to center racial equity. Indeed, that work remains even more critical today, and in a board discussion of this subject at our December meeting, our trustees vigorously reaffirmed this core commitment.</p>

<p>It’s one that we’ve been talking about in detail on our blog – including recent posts related to <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/progress-report-centering-racial-equity-in-climate-grantmaking"">centering racial equity in our climate program</a>, to outlining <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/learning-to-support-equitable-school-transformation"">effective strategies to support equitable school transformation efforts</a>, and to describing what it looks like to <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/change-from-the-inside-out"">prioritize racial equity in arts organizations</a>. In the next few months, we will also share a refined strategy for the next phase of our work to <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/special-initiatives/advancing-racial-wealth-equity-in-greater-boston"">advance racial wealth equity</a>.</p>

<p>As an organization committed to centering racial equity in its work, Barr will not—and cannot—retreat.</p>

<p><strong>Steadfast in sustaining a long-term view</strong></p>

<p>Barr’s mission to invest in potential requires adopting a long-term perspective. Our efforts to expand opportunity, remove barriers, foster healing, and advance a more equitable world are the work of generations, and progress is rarely in a straight line.</p>

<p>This coming May will mark my tenth year as Barr’s president, and one of the many things that has sustained and emboldened me as Barr’s leader has been the unwavering commitment our board has demonstrated to Barr’s core focus areas - which we reaffirmed soon after I arrived.</p>

<p>This consistency ensures we can be a better, more reliable, and constructive partner. And we hope it conveys our firm belief that change takes time. Still, we can’t ever become stagnant or unresponsive to a shifting environment. This past year, we shared a strategy update for our work <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/strategy-refresh-for-barr-foundation-mobility-work"">to advance equitable transportation and community planning and development</a>, and we announced the expansion of <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/three-new-community-foundations-join-creative-commonwealth-partnership-cambridge-greater-lowell-and-metrowest"">one of our arts initiatives</a> focused on the role of community foundations to serve as civic leaders and catalysts. These are just two examples of Barr’s commitment to adapt and refine, while sustaining core commitments.</p>

<p>Steadfast for us means holding tightly to mission, values and goals, but loosely to the strategies, tactics and approaches of any particular moment in time, always in partnership with others and informed by their perspectives. <blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--us""> <p>for</p> </blockquote>Precisely how we work to advance opportunities for people of color will inevitably evolve over time – but continuing this work is beyond question. Indeed, in 2024, we will have the opportunity to hear directly from our grantees as we undertake our next <a href=""https://cep.org/assessments/grantee-perception-report/"">Grantee Perception Report</a>, in partnership with the Center for Effective Philanthropy. We are eager to learn from this experience and committed to sharing the results, and our actions based on those findings, with you later this year.</p>

<p><strong>Steadfast in our gratitude</strong></p>

<p>Working in a philanthropic organization is an immense privilege; our role at its best is to facilitate, enable, support, and champion the work of those outside our walls. Those of us who staff foundations must strive ever to be humble, curious, and focused on serving others.
<blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--us""> <p>of</p> </blockquote>
One of my mentors often observed that a philanthropic organization does nothing by itself. We are like “one hand clapping,” he would add.</p>

<p>That is why we remain steadfast in our gratitude to our many partners: the ones who do the hard work, who are engaged on the front lines of social change, and who enrich us with their wisdom, experience, and partnership.</p>

<p>I conclude here where I began: this is going to be a challenging year. It’s why—more than ever—we will rely upon our partners to help us navigate these choppy waters and confront the challenges head-on, at the same time as we celebrate achievements and mark progress together.</p>

<p>My colleagues and I remain ever grateful for the dedication, commitment, and passion that our partners bring to their work each and every day. And we fully recognize that institutions like ours are only effective when serving others to do their best work.</p>

<p>That is indeed our steadfast commitment to you.</p>"
977,Three Themes for Advancing Wealth Building and Racial Equity,"<p>A series of listening sessions with leaders committed to building wealth highlight the importance of resilience, opportunity, and systems change.</p>","<p>As we work to shape the next phase of Barr’s <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/special-initiatives/advancing-racial-wealth-equity-in-greater-boston"">Racial Wealth Equity Initiative</a>, we knew we wanted to start by listening. Following an open invitation in June, we held 65 conversations with community leaders working in a variety of ways to build the wealth of people of color in Greater Boston. </p>

<p>In each of our conversations, we asked three questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What does “wealth” and “racial wealth equity” mean to you, your organization, your community? </li>
<li>What is an exciting, impactful strategy you believe will have systematic change around the issue of racial wealth equity? </li>
<li>What advice do you have for funders, such as Barr Foundation, seeking to partner in this area? </li>
</ul>

<p>We collaborated with <a href=""https://projectevident.org/"">Project Evident</a> to help synthesize what we heard. Here are three ideas that stood out to us: </p>

<p><strong>1. Wealth means opportunity, agency, and stability.</strong></p>

<p>When we asked leaders to define wealth they talked about the possibilities and resiliency that wealth building allows for themselves, their families, and their communities. Their reflections revealed a more expansive definition of wealth – while financial assets are critical, the ability to build wealth represents so much more. Wealth represents the freedom to choose life paths, such as education and career, that are fulfilling. It is having the security of knowing that you can weather an unexpected economic storm and still be on solid footing. People spoke to the important connection between wealth and health. Finally, wealth means communities have choices and control over their own assets. </p>

<p><strong>2. Achieving racial wealth equity requires supporting networks, infrastructure, and systems change.</strong></p>

<p>Throughout the listening sessions, leaders discussed a wide variety of approaches that contribute to building wealth among people of color. A few generated a lot of attention and interest - housing affordability, small businesses, quality education, and careers. Yet, in the sheer variety of promising approaches, we understand that there is no silver bullet  to magically erase a widening divide. Durable progress requires systems change.</p>

<p>Leaders emphasized that achieving racial wealth equity will require strengthening networks of organizations to break down silos across strategies and to foster collaboration. They uplifted the importance of these networks in building power across communities as a means of influencing change at the systems level. </p>

<p>To transform systems, they also connected power building approaches with the need to shift narratives and dismantle harmful myths - like just “pulling yourself up by your bootstraps” despite the legacy of discriminatory systems and policies. By acknowledging and centering the lived experiences of communities of color in our narratives, leaders believe we can change hearts and minds resulting in more equitable policies and systems.</p>

<p><strong>3. Solutions need to build wealth across generations and for whole communities.</strong></p>

<p>The listening sessions revealed for us that building intergenerational and community wealth is critical to developing economic resiliency now and fostering long-term systems change for the future. We heard that supporting community wealth building strategies is an opportunity to model ways of generating wealth that more equitable distribute resources. When asked to expand on the role that community wealth plays in achieving racial wealth equity, leaders explained the importance of community ownership over physical and financial assets. They elaborated that approaches like cooperative ownership and community land trust models are critical in protecting against market forces, especially in conversations around homeownership and entrepreneurship. Community ownership allows for magnifying benefits of long-term wealth generation to stay within a community and to be passed down from generation to generation rather than to be extracted from a place. These reflections reinforce the idea that community wealth building also builds power to influence systems level change. </p>

<p><strong>Gratitude and a commitment to keep listening</strong></p>

<p>Barr launched the Racial Wealth Equity Initiative strategy in 2022 and has so far distributed $25 million to 21 organizations that aim to build wealth for communities of color across Greater Boston. With a dedicated team now in place and an opportunity to build on this foundation in coming years, we knew we wanted to start with listening. We are so grateful for all of those who were willing to spend time with us to share their ideas and aspirations. These key themes are informing our approach for the work ahead. We look forward to sharing what’s next for the Initiative early in the New Year. And we commit to continuing to listen as we move forward.</p>"
976,"Three New Community Foundations Join “Creative Commonwealth” Partnership – Cambridge, Greater Lowell, and MetroWest","<p>Expanded initiative now includes eight community foundations. Next three years to feature new and deepened investments, experiments, and learning to advance more equitable, vibrant, and sustainable arts and creativity in communities across Massachusetts.</p>","<p>It is a joy to announce <a href=""https://cambridgecf.org/"">Cambridge Community Foundation</a>, <a href=""https://www.communityfoundationmw.org/"">Community Foundation for MetroWest</a>, and <a href=""https://www.glcfoundation.org/"">Greater Lowell Community Foundation</a> as participants in Barr’s Creative Commonwealth Initiative. Each carries active commitment to arts and exciting aspirations that Barr will support through a three-year, $525,000 grant beginning in 2024. Their involvement promises new resources targeted to arts and creativity in even more parts of the state, as well as greater opportunities for alignment and collaboration through this novel partnership of private and community foundations.</p>

<p>The three new members join five community foundations that have been part of the Creative Commonwealth Initiative since inception in 2017: <a href=""https://berkshiretaconic.org/initiatives-impact/community-engagement"">Berkshire Taconic Community Foundation</a>, <a href=""http://communityfoundation.org/nonprofits/valleycreates/"">Community Foundation of Western Massachusetts</a>, <a href=""https://www.eccf.org/arts-and-culture/"">Essex County Community Foundation</a>, <a href=""https://greaterworcester.org/impact-initiatives/strategic-priorities/creative-worcester-county"">Greater Worcester Community Foundation</a>, and <a href=""https://southcoastcf.org/learn/strategic-priorities/creative-southcoast/"">SouthCoast Community Foundation</a>. All partners do remarkable work to advance diverse, equitable arts and creative expression within their communities.</p>

<p>Barr’s collaboration with community foundations springs from a shared belief in <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/arts-creativity"">the power of arts and creativity to transform communities</a>, and in the unique role community foundations can play as civic leaders and catalysts of positive change.</p>

<p>All partners bring arts grantmaking experience, knowledge, and relationships to this work. Each embraces diversity and is growing its capacity for inclusive and just practices. The geographies they serve contain a density of arts organizations and cultures, including African, Latinx, Asian, Arab, and Native American, and are home to significant immigrant populations. We hope that progress within each of these regions also benefits the creative sector statewide – helping it become more equitable and grow its relevance, resources, and resilience.</p>

<p><em>By advancing equity and resilience in arts ecosystems across eight regions, initiative partners improve the statewide arts ecosystem -  elevating arts and creative expression as central to thriving, engaged communities throughout the Commonwealth.</em></p>

<p>New partners have their own starting points and focus within the initiative:</p>

<p><strong>Cambridge Community Foundation</strong>. Arts and culture are core to the Cambridge Community Foundation’s commitment to social cohesion, which, alongside economic mobility, is a central pillar of its newly released strategic plan. Arts and culture strategies include ecosystem research, partnerships with local funders, support for arts organizations and artists, including access to local arts spaces, leadership development in established and emerging organizations, and relaunch of  its Cultural Capital Fund.</p>

<p><strong>Community Foundation for MetroWest</strong>. Arts are also a core program area for the Community Foundation for MetroWest. Convenings, capacity building, evaluation, and storytelling amplify grant investments. Current priorities include gaining a deeper understanding of arts stakeholders and ensuring that historically underrepresented voices, and under-resourced organizations, help shape the future of the sector.</p>

<p><strong>Greater Lowell Community Foundation</strong>. “Mosaic Lowell” is Lowell’s arts, culture, and creative economy plan and has been the guiding framework for deepening the community foundation’s involvement with arts. Research and collaboration with arts and culture leaders across its service area will inform grantmaking for a stronger regional arts ecosystem.</p>

<p>These new Creative Commonwealth partners join a peer group that thrives on curiosity and innovation, is willing to take risks, and values learning. Barr and all eight community foundations are co-designing strategies and supports that will shape this collaboration through 2026.</p>

<p>We look forward to all that will come as our partners gather research, make new investments that enable arts and creativity to flourish in their regions, and cultivate new and increased philanthropy for local artists and arts organizations. And we look forward to sharing more in the new year, as the work and learning unfolds in the vital quest to elevate diverse, equitable arts and creative expression in Commonwealth communities.</p>"
971,Progress Report: Centering Racial Equity in Climate Grantmaking,"<p>Barr’s Climate Director shares the story and learnings behind our ongoing work to advance a more diverse, inclusive, and equity-centered climate movement.</p>","<p>Almost two years ago, <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/money-talks-here-s-what-we-want-it-to-say"">I wrote here</a> about new work on Barr’s Climate Team to significantly increase grantmaking to people of color (POC)-led, equity-centered organizations. This is an extension of Barr’s commitment to center racial equity as a core value through our grantmaking and practices. It also stems from our firm belief that addressing climate change will only be possible with a diverse, inclusive, and equity-centered movement. In December 2021, I reported our baseline - roughly 10% ($5.2 million) of our 2019 and 2020 climate grantmaking went to POC-led, equity-centered organizations. I also stated our commitments to keep improving and to be transparent about progress.</p>

<p>That’s why I am thrilled to share that we have more than doubled that baseline. In 2021 and 2022, our grantmaking to POC-led, equity-centered climate organizations totaled $15.8 million, which was 22.8% of our climate grantmaking those two years. And we are projecting an even higher percentage for 2023. In this post, I want to share the story behind those numbers – <strong>five ways of working and new partnerships to advance a more diverse, inclusive, equitable, and effective climate field.</strong></p>
<h3>1. Investing in Existing Partners and Connecting to New Ones</h3>
<p>Being explicit about our goal to support more POC-led, equity-centered organizations led us to deepen support to many existing partners – with larger, more flexible, and longer-term grants, and supplemental funding to build resiliency. Our commitments also guided our approach, outreach, and network building to find and support new partners.</p>

<p>We recognized that there are existing community-based leaders working on a range of multiple issues to address systemic injustices. Because of the trust they already hold in their communities, such leaders can be enormously effective in connecting climate to what matters most in their context, ensuring that climate action reflects local priorities, and that locals reap the benefits from the opportunities climate action creates. We <strong>revamped our Climate Program</strong> <a href=""https://form.asana.com/?k=x--JUpznjArnm60LIl_J9Q&d=1142825572013395""><strong>online inquiry form</strong></a> to add accessibility as well as clarity about our keen interest in supporting POC-led, equity-centered organizations working in clean energy, mobility, and resilience. We asked our current partners to circulate the form in their networks.</p>

<p>As a result of increased outreach, we’ve been excited to add several new organizations to our portfolio that were already trusted partners in their communities – such as <a href=""https://tribalcleanenergy.org/"">The Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy</a>, which is working with Native American tribes in New England to transition toward clean energy systems, and <a href=""https://www.arisespringfield.org/"">Arise for Social Justice</a>, which is organizing low income people to fight oppression in all its manifestations, including environmental injustice in Springfield, MA (you can see all of <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/grantmaking/grants?query=&program_areas%5B%5D=climate&years%5B%5D=2023&years%5B%5D=2022&years%5B%5D=2021#Grants"">our Climate grants since 2021 here</a>).</p>
<h3>2. Simplifying the Steps for Grant Applications and Reporting</h3>
<p>We took a fresh look at all our grant application and reporting processes with an eye towards offering more flexibility and choice for how our partners could get us essential information. We wanted to emphasize real connections and relationships over the grantmaking transaction. As a result, we’re now <strong>doing a lot more through conversations</strong> (with our team members doing the work to document), and there’s a lot less paperwork we’re asking our partners to generate for us.</p>
<h3>3. Supporting Benchmarking, Peer Learning, and Action to Advance Racial Equity</h3>
<p>Based on feedback from our grantees on how we can best support their racial equity efforts, in the fall of 2021, we commissioned a <a href=""https://barrfdn.issuelab.org/resource/baseline-findings-from-the-racial-equity-organizational-self-assessments-of-barr-foundation-climate-program-grantees.html""><strong>self-assessment</strong></a> for organizations to reflect on their racial equity efforts and to assist them in benchmarking progress over time. We made this available and optional for all our current grantees and over 80 (90% of our current grantees) chose to participate. Following their participation, organizations received their profiles, and we learned about how the racial equity self-assessment prompted or accelerated conversations about areas of growth (<a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/what-does-it-look-like-to-center-equity-in-hr"">for example, learn about Vote Solar&#39;s HR practices here</a>). To further expedite progress for grantees who had demonstrated commitment to make changes in their culture and operations, we introduced a <strong>racial equity organizational development grant application</strong>. These grants have ranged between $10,000 and $30,000 and are typically utilized to hire consultants to facilitate organizational change opportunities connected to centering equity.</p>

<p>One consistent theme brought up by our grantees is that people are really interested in what others are doing and learning in their racial equity efforts. In response, <strong>we launched a peer learning process</strong>, inviting our grantees to self-organize groups on topics of shared interest. We received an incredibly enthusiastic response, with over 60 participants forming five peer-learning groups covering topics like hiring and retention, board development, strategy, and community participation in decision-making. The feedback received so far has been very positive, with participants valuing the opportunity to exchange insights, experiences, and best practices. To support these groups, we offer help with scheduling, facilitation, and access to relevant experts for advice and support.</p>
<h3>4. Enhancing Leadership Infrastructure, Pathways, and Networks</h3>
<p>We’ve been resourcing new approaches to building a more diverse cadre of leaders for the climate movement. This includes fostering a network of climate leaders who are already working in communities on a range of other issues. That’s why we’ve supported the <a href=""https://hyamsfoundation.org/new-report-released-building-movement-infrastructure-project-process-evaluation/"">Climate Justice Organizing School</a> led by the Hyams Foundation, and the <a href=""https://www.onesquareworld.org/liberationleadership"">Liberation Leadership Program</a> by One Square World. And we’re exploring participatory grantmaking with the <a href=""https://grassrootsfund.org/amplifying-voices/make-decisions-on-grants"">New England Grassroots Environmental Fund</a> (which is currently seeking community grant readers for its Fall 2023 cycle).</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--investing""> <p>been</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>We’ve also focused on strengthening the network of these community-rooted climate leaders. As they connect with each other and build relationships, it fosters new partnership and mutual support on advocacy, organizing, and work to transform their own organizational cultures and practices rooted in justice and healing. <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/pocie-day-of-wellness"">Our support for the Professionals of Color in the Environment’s (POCIE’s) network</a> is one example.</p>

<p>Another important facet of leadership infrastructure is keeping allies engaged and playing their part. One common challenge in equity-oriented work is that individuals and groups who have been most marginalized can end up carrying the lion’s share of the work to bring about change. We know that POC-led, equity-centered organizations are not the only ones who care about advancing a more diverse, inclusive, equitable future. And they can’t do it alone! Creating that better world requires all of us. That’s why we have been intentional about <strong>engaging all our grantees in discussions about racial equity</strong> and supporting their efforts to commit to integrating it within their organizations, and in their work.</p>
<h3>5. Reflecting, Course-correcting, and Being Transparent</h3>
<p>An important part of reflecting on our approach and strategies has been taking an honest look at where we may have made missteps, listening carefully to our partners, making adjustments, and sharing about all of the above – like <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/strategy-refresh-for-barr-foundation-mobility-work"">this recent post from our Mobility Team</a> on a refresh to their strategy.</p>

<p>In early 2021, the Donors of Color Network launched the <a href=""https://www.climate.donorsofcolor.org/"">Climate Funders Justice Pledge</a>. They urged the nation’s largest climate funders to commit publicly to disclose how much of their funding was going to people of color-led power building groups, AND to embrace a goal of at least 30%. At the time, we committed to the transparency portion of the pledge and shared our baseline. Though we’ve come a distance since then already, we know there’s plenty more work still to do. And we could not be more proud or grateful to support such a tremendous group of partners in their work to advance equitable solutions to climate change.</p>"
968,A Strategy Refresh for Barr’s Mobility Work,"<p>A next evolution to advance equitable solutions for transportation, community planning, and development in Massachusetts.</p>","<p>Barr’s Climate Program began in 2010 with the goal of helping Boston and Massachusetts reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the energy and transportation sectors - the two largest greenhouse gas contributors in the state. In 2015, the transportation work became Barr’s Mobility Strategy, with a dual focus on transportation and how we design our communities.</p>

<p>With all that has changed in the world since 2015, and with the Foundation adopting a new value to center racial equity, we recently embarked on a strategy refresh process, and leaned into new possibilities for how to better express the scope and ambitions of our Mobility grantmaking.</p>
<h3>A Changing World and Changing Work</h3>
<p>In 2020, COVID-19 altered every facet of people’s lives – including transportation. More people than ever started working from home. The use of public transportation and driving declined dramatically, while biking and walking increased in many locations. Traffic patterns and congestion shifted. People also started thinking about and using public spaces differently – not just parks, but sidewalks and streets – and these became vitally important for people’s physical and mental health. Meanwhile, Spring 2020 brought new attention to race-based violence, which led many people across the country to learn more about the long history of colonization and anti-Blackness in the United States, including the <a href=""https://stateinnovation.org/anti-racist-state-budgets-transportation-equity/"">role of transportation in that history</a>.</p>

<p>These changes prompted several shifts in Barr’s Mobility grantmaking through 2020 and 2021, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>funding more efforts that address the negative impacts of transportation and land use policies on people of color, such as supporting advocacy around transit affordability and equitable fare enforcement;</li>
<li>supporting projects to help people enjoy walking, biking, and public spaces as approaches to get outdoors while maintaining physical distance; and</li>
<li>funding grantees’ efforts to be more diverse, inclusive, and equitable, including professional development and coaching for people of color, leadership training to manage boards, and racial equity training and planning.</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2022, we felt it was time to take stock of these changes, what we learned along the way, and to refresh the mobility strategy to better align with current contexts and needs.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--we""> <p>2022</p> </blockquote></p>
<h3>Key Lessons From Grantmaking</h3>
<p>To look forward, our first step was to look back. We wanted to reflect on our role and the power we hold as grantmakers, what worked well, and our mistakes. Four key lessons stood out for us:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Our role is not to set the agenda, but instead to provide support as communities do</strong> – When we’ve tried to set the agenda, projects have floundered as they weren’t priorities for the communities they intended to serve. Additionally, we missed opportunities for partnerships because people assumed their needs weren’t a part of our priorities. To be effective, we must start from a place of humility, with the recognition that solutions come from the people closest to the issues. We’ve seen the most progress when we’ve engaged, supported, and co-created strategies and campaigns with our partners in these ways. </li>
<li><strong>Effective policy advocacy requires collaborations rooted in community needs</strong> – By funding multiple groups to work on the same issue without intentionality encouraging relationship-building and collaboration, we reinforced the idea that policy solutions can develop in silos. This lack of alignment has led to individual organizations failing to advance their policy objectives. Our recent work to support opportunities for collaboration between mainstream and grassroots organizations, in addition to training on racial equity, has helped to inspire new partnerships that can be more effective in driving policy change. </li>
<li><strong>We have an active role to play as conveners, honest brokers, and matchmakers</strong> - While we strive to step back and let our grantees and partners lead the way, we’ve learned that we cannot underestimate the power of bringing people and organizations together. This is true both among our nonprofit partners, and within government and the business community. </li>
<li><strong>Joy and rest are essential to long-term work</strong> – In addition to the last three years being especially stressful, mobility work is always challenging. The problems are systemic; progress happens over decades not months or years; and there is urgency in the work – it impacts people’s lives today and every day. We realized we needed to lean into the role we can play to nurture and sustain the mobility community.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Where We&#39;re Headed</h3>
<p>By digging into our work, we affirmed our commitment to the overarching goal of reducing transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions in Massachusetts. The refresh process helped us clarify that our role in advancing this goal combines support for:</p>

<ul>
<li>policies and projects that advance the development of a low-carbon transportation system (e.g., walking, biking, transit, and other shared modes), and</li>
<li>community planning and development practices that make it easy for people to use that system to get what they need.</li>
</ul>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--into""> <p>digging</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Our work is built on a diverse set of partnerships with community-based organizations, advocates, municipal and state agencies, researchers, the business community, and others involved in design, planning, policy development, and implementation.</p>

<p>In our strategy, we incorporated the new approaches we had adopted since 2020 to ensure they would continue. This included uplifting the following in the strategy:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Barr’s value of centering racial equity</strong> – Recognizing the unique ways in which transportation and planning policies have been used to perpetuate racial inequities and resulted in an overdependence on greenhouse gas-emitting modes (e.g., cars), we understand that the Mobility strategy has an important role to play in making racial equity a central aspect of efforts to address climate change.</li>
<li><strong>Community voice and engagement</strong> – Recognizing that people will embrace low-carbon transportation options only when the transportation system aligns with their needs, and understanding that the most effective solutions arise from engaging people in the process, it becomes clear that it is essential for policymakers and practitioners to involve communities throughout the policy development and project planning phases. We are firmly dedicated to fostering authentic and inclusive community engagement.</li>
<li><strong>The potential to foster more collaboration within the Climate Program and across other Barr programs</strong> – Even as our work continues to be focused on mobility-specific goals, we see an increasing number of opportunities to collaborate across the Climate Program, and with the other programs and special initiatives at the Foundation.</li>
</ul>

<p>We remain devoted to supporting the reduction of transportation-related emissions in Massachusetts, for the benefit of communities across the state and the globe; and focused on maintaining strong relationships with existing partners while staying <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/climate#inquiries"">open to new ideas and partners</a>. Together, we can reduce and prevent climate change through equitable solutions for transportation, community planning, and development across Massachusetts.</p>"
967,New Englanders Welcome the Clean Energy Transition,<p>Recent focus groups underscore widespread enthusiasm for clean energy and urgency for electrification in New England</p>,"<ul>
<li>Since 2010, the Climate Program’s clean energy team has regularly commissioned research to better understand New England voters’ opinions on climate change and clean energy. After <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/massachusetts-voters-want-more-clean-energy-insights-from-our-2022-poll"">our 2022 poll</a>, we were interested in better understanding perspectives about the region’s clean energy future - including the phasing out of gas and other fossil fuels.</li>
<li>In the summer of 2023, we sponsored six focus groups with homeowners in each New England state and a final group with renters to gain further insights. We were particularly interested in discussing electrification, which has become a central part of climate strategies in the region. </li>
<li>In alignment with the climate poll, respondents had an overwhelmingly positive perception of clean energy, but they also had questions about implementation, the costs of the energy transition, and how their own lives might change in the future.</li>
</ul>

<p>As New England increases the momentum of its energy transition in response to worsening climate impacts, states are shifting out of planning towards implementation. To help surface key opportunities, challenges, and questions to support this momentum, the clean energy team sponsored new research to better understand how New England residents are thinking about and experiencing the energy transition in their daily lives.</p>

<p>In July and August, the clean energy team commissioned Hart Research to conduct a series of online focus groups with homeowners and renters in each of the New England states. We wanted to get a deeper understanding of experiences and opinions driving the polling data. Across each of the focus groups, we targeted a representative sample of residents at or below a moderate average median income (AMI) for their state. The responses were remarkably consistent across each of the New England states, homeowners and renters. There are a few key takeaways from these conversations that we wanted to share:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>New England is excited about clean energy.</strong> In each state, focus group participants had positive views of clean energy and saw it as the technology of the future. Many respondents viewed the clean energy transition as inevitable. They encouraged incentives and policies at the state and federal level that further clean energy development. Respondents offered  health benefits, climate, a better environment and less dependence on fossil fuels as reasons for their enthusiasm about the energy transition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>People are still worried about grid reliability.</strong> Alongside discussing renewable energy supply, the focus groups also covered electrification, specifically the transition of heating and cooling from fossil fuels to clean electricity. A factor which gave participants pause was grid reliability. Participants were concerned about the ability of the electric system to handle the transition of the power supply and the addition of many heat pumps and electric vehicles. Stories of blackouts from Texas and California were top of mind for participants. They were unaware of federal and state efforts to support grid infrastructure upgrades and modifications and what improved grid infrastructure could look like.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Residents’ hesitation to adopt clean technologies is tied to costs, and most are unaware of incentives that are already available to them (or will be soon).</strong> During the session, we spoke with participants about how the energy transition might impact their day-to-day lives in their homes. Many respondents had positive views of weatherization and both homeowners and renters were aware of and had taken advantage of opportunities such as weatherization and/or free light bulbs. Participants were highly cost sensitive and were concerned about both the upfront cost of replacing equipment as well as the ongoing operating costs of new equipment. There was little to no awareness of federal or state incentives for major purchases, such as heat pumps, electric vehicles, or solar. In the coming months, energy efficiency program administrators will need to educate the public about the impact of both state and federal incentives on the cost of clean energy technologies. This education should also include information to help consumers understand operating costs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>People like heat pumps (once they know what they are).</strong> Beyond limited awareness of available incentives, most participants had not heard of heat pumps before the focus groups. After group facilitators described the technology, participants were genuinely interested. Respondents liked that heat pumps were renewable and able to offer both heating and cooling, especially with New England’s warming summers. When we asked participants what  their biggest takeaway from the session was, one of the most frequent responses was interest in learning more about heat pumps. The Maine focus group stood out in that more Mainers were familiar with the technology. At present, Maine currently has the highest installed heat pump capacity in New England and it achieved its 2025 target of 100,000 heat pump installations two years early - in June 2023. The State’s successful outreach about heat pumps could partially explain the focus group result and could offer lessons learned for other states, cities, and towns wishing to encourage homeowners to take advantage of federal incentives.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rooftop solar is considered a luxury.</strong> Participants were aware of rooftop solar and had significant interest in solar as a tool for energy savings. Throughout New England for more than a decade, rooftop solar has been encouraged through various rebates, low-interest loans, tax incentives, and other policies to reduce the upfront cost for consumers. These efforts likely help contribute to high consumer awareness of solar PV in the region. However, despite the existence of these programs, participants still viewed rooftop PV as a luxury good inaccessible to everyday people. Participants also complained that aggressive sales tactics and confusing offers left them feeling frustrated. If states intend to encourage further solar adoption in light of available federal incentives, consumer education and consumer protection must accompany these efforts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Participants like the idea of clean heat standards+.</strong> While no respondent had heard of the term, “Clean Heat Standard,” after the facilitator explained that clean heat standards regulate companies to reduce natural gas use, the policy approach was viewed favorably across all focus groups. Participants also liked that the policy effectively uses incentives to help people of lower and middle incomes to transition to cleaner energy. The respondents had questions about compliance and accountability if this type of regulation was implemented. These questions are also still being debated in Massachusetts and Vermont, where there are currently open regulatory discussions about heating standards.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These focus groups provided a glimpse into how New England residents are thinking about the energy transition within their lives. As a member of the Massachusetts Grid Modernization Advisory Council, I know these findings will be helpful as we explore crucial questions about how to enhance flexibility, adaptability, and reliability of the grid to support the State&#39;s ongoing electrification efforts. We hope that sharing these results also helps our partners identify areas where there may be gaps in current consumer outreach and education, particularly as federal incentives and grantmaking accelerate in the coming months.  </p>

966,Little Amal Walks Across Massachusetts,<p>A powerful fusion of theater and public art brings together communities to raise awareness for local and global issues</p>,"<p>As summer winds down and Massachusetts prepares to usher in autumn, we can look forward to an exciting visit from a friend in search of a home. Little Amal, a 12-foot tall, little girl puppet from Syria, will land in Boston on September 7 to begin her nine-week journey across the United States, “from sea to shining sea.”</p>

<p>Massachusetts was chosen because of the resonance of Boston as the site of the beginnings of European immigration in 1620. Welcomed on behalf of the city by members of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe and Mayor Wu, Amal will spend three days in Boston and the rest of the week in Massachusetts, visiting Ashfield and North Adams.</p>

<p>Dozens of Massachusetts arts organizations and hundreds of artists, advocates, and community leaders will host Amal across the Commonwealth’s neighborhoods, cities, and towns. We invite you to join in welcoming Amal and in celebrating the beauty and diversity of the cultures and creative expressions that breathe life into Massachusetts and illuminate the vibrancy and necessity of human connection.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--invite""> <p>We</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Little Amal, whose name means hope in Arabic, is a powerful fusion of theater and public art that brings together communities to raise awareness for local and global issues, including immigration, migration, gentrification, and climate resilience. Her walk opens spaces for communities to come together and openly discuss these challenges while also sparking joy, celebration, and unity.</p>

<p>Little Amal was created in response to the growing refugee crisis set off by the war in Syria and is an international collaboration among the U.K.-based The Walk Productions, Handspring Puppet Company, Artistic Director Amir Nizar Nuabi, Choose Love, and thousands of artists. In her 2021 walk from the Syrian-Turkish border to Manchester, England, over a million people walked with her along parts of her journey, with another 10 million participating online. Little Amal quickly became a symbol of human rights on behalf of the millions of refugees around the world and has participated in over 200 welcome events in 97 cities in 15 countries.</p>

<p><div style=""padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/858055886?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"" style=""position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;"" title=""Amal Walks Across America""></iframe></div><script src=""https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js""></script></p>

<p>Little Amal has three primary goals as she walks around the world in search of home, community, and belonging: 1) To foster empathy by fully being who she is – a 10-year-old Syrian girl; 2) To work as an ally for people migrating; and 3) To create moments of beautiful artistry and joy that are authentic and meaningful to the local people she meets.</p>

<p>Amal has an urgent message on behalf of refugees and migrants displaced by war: “See us. We are right here.” This global crisis affects tens of thousands of people world-wide, half of whom are children. She is also a source of her namesake hope, and her journey reminds us that people are not defined by the bad things that happen to them or the challenges they face. We are part of a global neighborhood and there is beauty in welcoming those who are different than us. Sharing and uplifting the diverse experiences that make us all human help us imagine possibilities for a thriving world greater than one person, or even one community, can imagine.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--an""> <p>has</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>At Barr, the Arts &amp; Creativity team is excited to support Little Amal’s visit for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Amal’s walk will uplift and celebrate Massachusetts immigrant communities and their culturally-specific creative expressions and disciplines;</li>
<li>Little Amal’s walk demonstrates the power of theater and public art to speak to current issues and to imagine solutions;</li>
<li>Local artists will be celebrated as key players in driving change and as assets in creating thriving, vibrant communities;</li>
<li>Artists, changemakers, and activists from multiple sectors are coming together to collaborate on Little Amal’s welcome in perhaps the largest collaborative community celebration that Boston has seen since the pandemic; </li>
<li>Amal’s journey in Massachusetts provokes artistic responses that catalyze new ways of thinking about racial and cultural equity; and finally,</li>
<li>The welcoming events for Amal are fantastic opportunities to gather in person to celebrate community, culture, and healing after three years of ongoing pandemic and social upheaval impacts. Her visit is a chance to be together, and, to borrow a phrase from Barr’s Climate team, to pause for joy with Amal! </li>

965,“Helping people achieve things they didn’t think were possible”,"<p>A Q&A with Senior Program Officer for Education, John Travis</p>","<h3>You bring to the Education Program years of experience as a teacher and school leader in the Boston Public Schools. What inspired you to get into education?</h3>
<p>I’ve told this story 100 different ways, but it always starts with my parents. My father was a music teacher, my mother became a school nurse when I was 10, and they both retired from the School District of Philadelphia. So, you could say that I fell into the family business in a way.</p>

<p>But it’s deeper than that. I’m a product of educational opportunity. I’m from a neighborhood in West Philadelphia called Mantua which was predominantly Black and lower income. In Philly, like many places in our country both then and now, your neighborhood determined where you went to school, and your neighborhood’s demographics determined functional access to opportunity. Not just who attended your school, but also the broader public narrative, perception, and belief held by some around needs, resources, and expected outcomes. Sitting two blocks from my house and across the street from a high-rise public housing development, my local K-8 school was a persistently “low-performing,” under-resourced school… that I never attended.</p>

<p>Because of my father’s social capital as an educator, my parents received support navigating the paper-based school transfer process, a vestige of Philadelphia’s attempts to racially integrate schools. Through this, I had the opportunity to attend the school where my father worked, eight blocks away — just one neighborhood over. But, unlike my local school, it was racially and socioeconomically diverse. It had been founded in the late 60s, during the progressive educational movement as an intentionally desegregated school and in Philadelphia it was a gateway to opportunity.</p>

<p>I got that opportunity. It wasn’t offered to every young person who grew up in my neighborhood, and I’m just not OK with that. I don’t believe we can deliver on the ideals of a democratic society without ensuring that all students have access to the kind of learning experiences I gained access to. Every student deserves that.</p>

<p>I became a teacher because I felt like I had an obligation to take what I had received and give it back, particularly to students who grew up in neighborhoods like mine, with backgrounds like mine. </p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--a""> <p>became</p> </blockquote> 
I started as a secondary math teacher and eventually felt the encouragement and pull to consider more systemic challenges. That took me to graduate school, leadership positions at the Boston Public Schools, and now here. But no matter what seat I’m in, my focus has been on making schools and our schooling system increasingly equitable and excellent, giving particular attention to the communities and students our society continues to serve poorly.</p>
<h3>How does that experience inform your approach to grantmaking?</h3>
<p>My experience has informed my entire career and some key beliefs that will undoubtedly inform my grantmaking in evolving ways. I’ve approached my career with the belief that all students are worthy of educational opportunities like I received. I believe the bar for achieving this kind of equity and excellence is very high, likely higher than the field of education and our broader society has acknowledged. Despite this high challenge, I sense a growing desire from the field to aspire to reach it.  I don’t believe our systems have figured out how to do it yet and this honestly fills me with hope, because it means that our future could be fundamentally different from the past that our society has inherited.</p>

<p>Having spent the majority of my career in schools – and being the proud son to educators – I sense how much is being asked and demanded of teachers and leaders to reach this aspiration and how much the support they are given to succeed is falling short. I believe that transforming our education system requires focusing on the &quot;instructional core,&quot; as Richard Elmore put it — the intersection of teachers, students, and content. What happens at the core matters most and everything else around it should be in service of protecting, deepening, and strengthening the quality of interactions between teachers, students, and content.</p>

<p>As I lead the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/invest-in-educators"">Invest in Educators</a> portfolio, I’m constantly thinking about how an individual grant or a body of grantmaking will impact who is leading in our classrooms, schools, and districts and how they are being prepared and developed in their work. I’m holding onto my lived experience as an educator tightly, keeping my focus there.   </p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--lead""> <p>I</p> </blockquote></p>
<h3>What does “investing in educators” mean to you?</h3>
<p>Education is fundamentally a human endeavor and the people who do the work matter tremendously. Not just the identities they hold, the skills they develop, and the outcomes they achieve for students, but also how they are seen, valued, and supported along the way. </p>

<p>At times, I feel as though some of the initiatives within education reform are predicated on “human-proofing” education, treating the people who do the work as interchangeable parts in some kind of assembly line. I have so much respect for the profession and the people who choose to enter classrooms and teach, and who choose to enter schools to support and lead.</p>

<p>When I was in eighth grade, I was struggling so much in math that I became actively defiant toward learning. I wouldn’t open my notebook or complete my homework. I was confused and embarrassed and on my first report card earned the worst grade I had ever received. I was disengaging as a learner.</p>

<p>I thank the Lord every day that Michael Neights was my eighth-grade math teacher. Somehow, even though I had given up on math and on myself, he refused to give up on me. He helped me see that if I shifted my approach to learning, I could be successful. He was willing to stay late and talk with me, person to person. At the risk of hyperbole, he changed my life.</p>

<p>As a Black man from West Philadelphia, there were many other versions of my life story that could have been written. Mr. Neights took the extra step to know me, communicate unwavering belief in my potential, and write himself into my story. Years on, as an early career math teacher, I thought about him often.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--eighth-grade""> <p>Neights</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Every classroom deserves a great teacher. Every school deserves a great leader. And I think our present ecosystem is not structured in a way to support the people who do the work to make that a reality everywhere.</p>
<h3>Are there specific projects, grants, or initiatives you’re excited to work on at Barr?</h3>
<p>It has been such a privilege to sit in this seat and meet all of our amazing grantee organizations and their leaders. The Invest in Educators portfolio supports organizations who support educators – teachers, principals, superintendents – both directly and indirectly. Two major efforts that I have been excited to inherit are our Strengthening School Leadership cohort and Driving Towards Diversity cohort of schools and districts. Through respected organizations like the <a href=""https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/carroll-school/sites/lynch-leadership-academy.html"">Lynch Leadership Academy</a>, <a href=""https://www.relay.edu/"">Relay Graduate School of Education</a>, <a href=""https://schoolempowermentnetwork.org/"">School Empowerment Network</a>, and <a href=""https://tntp.org/"">TNTP (formerly the New Teacher Project)</a>, districts across these cohorts have been redesigning their approach to developing and supporting school leaders and examining their talent practices to increase the diversity of their educator workforce.  </p>

<p>In light of the recent Supreme Court decision related to affirmative action, organizations like <a href=""https://theteachersloungema.org/"">The Teachers’ Lounge</a>—committed to cultivating communities where educators of color thrive, and <a href=""https://heisme.org/"">He Is Me Institute</a>—striving to see more black men enter teaching— have been particularly on my mind. These are the sorts of programs I wished existed when I started my own career. I am proud of the many organizations across the portfolio that refuse to allow a court to erase history and the lingering impacts of racist policies, practices, and beliefs.</p>
<h3>So you got your start teaching mathematics. What’s your favorite thing about math?</h3>
<p>After my eighth-grade teacher helped me turn things around in math, it officially became my favorite subject in high school. I found it fascinating, particularly calculus and statistics. The thing I love about mathematics, and the teaching of it, is that it is a rich context for learning that we can do more than we think we can. Many students think they can’t be successful at math until they work with someone who helps them believe in themselves. That was my story. I tried to be that type of educator for my students and school leader for my staff.</p>

<p>No matter what I am doing, whether I’m a teacher, a principal, or working in a district central office, I get really excited about helping people achieve things they didn’t think were possible. And my role at Barr is allowing me to keep doing that.</p>"
963,"A Day of Wellness, a Decade of Reflection",<p>Building community for professionals of color in the environmental movement</p>,"<p>This is a story about a normal Friday afternoon that happened to be one of the most exciting moments in my personal and professional life. 
To set the scene: I walk into a room full of people – food, laughter, smiles all around. A long banquet table is full of delicious plant-based food and freshly-squeezed juices, all provided by local black-owned businesses. I smell curry, ginger, and faintly, lavender. I’ve just walked onto the campus of Mass Audubon’s Boston Nature Center. Nestled in the heart of Mattapan, I’m surrounded by more than two miles of trails to enjoy that twist through forest, meadows, wetlands, and community gardens.</p>

<p>It could be any Friday afternoon; it could be any group of people. But it’s not. It’s a space that I and many other Black, Indigenous, and other people of color (BIPOC) environmental professionals have yearned for – in my case, for over a decade.

That Friday afternoon was <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/company/professionals-of-color-in-the-environment-pocie/about/"">Professionals of Color in the Environment’s (POCIE’s)</a> first “Day of Wellness.” The event focused on creating space for BIPOC environmentalists to take a moment to breathe, decompress, and build community through movement and stillness, communication and quiet. </p>

<p>The intention was for participants to choose their own adventure that met their needs: yoga, mindfulness, meditation, and massages were all available. Or, they could decide to sprawl out in the sun, or under a tree with a book or journal.</p>

<p>As an Arab-American studying and working in environmental spaces, I’ve longed for a community like this. The Day of Wellness was my very first time experiencing a BIPOC-only space for environmentalists. Out of hundreds of classrooms, teams, workspaces, conferences, and field research trips, it was extraordinary to be in an environmental space free from the burdens of representation and explanation. Universally, these spaces are crucial. They allow for community building, resource sharing, knowledge exchange, and much more - ultimately serving as incubators for personal and professional growth and inspiring the next generation of BIPOC leaders in the environmental field.<br>
<blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--spaces""> <p>these</p> </blockquote> </p>

<p>Personally, having access to spaces like the one we gathered for during the Day of Wellness would have impacted me dramatically – by fostering a sense of belonging and empowerment in climate and environmental spaces that wasn’t organically available. Additionally, POCIE’s community and network would have been an invaluable resource for me to grow personally and professionally for the past decade.</p>

<p>POCIE represents those who, at minimum, have two very important things in common. One: everyone has committed part or all their lives’ work to environmental stewardship in some form. Two: every POCIE community member identifies as BIPOC. By nature, POCIE is rooted in Black, brown, and Indigenous knowledge and practice, and represents the origins of conservation and connectivity with nature. Our community is composed of the faces of climate activism, environmental justice, and community organizing.</p>

<p>However, nothing we’re trying to do is new. Everything we do is a proverbial return to our roots, as this group reflects the origins of conservation and environmental stewardship. That means community focused, with open lines of communication and input on how to best address the needs of our peers and steward our shared environment.</p>

<p>POCIE envisions BIPOC communities having decision-making power and leadership roles in environmental practices, climate action, and community well-being. We strive to make this vision reality through the <strong>three main pillars of our work:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Creating safe spaces for environmental professionals of color to gather for social and professional networking</li>
<li>Promoting cross-sector collaborations by building professional partnerships</li>
<li>Building a pathway for students and early career professionals of color to succeed in the environmental sector and take the lead as the next generation of environmental leaders</li>
</ol>

<p>As POCIE’s Operations Manager, creating the spaces that I’d long dreamed of is profoundly fulfilling. In addition to the Day of Wellness, I have been fortunate enough to dive into work targeting POCIE’s two other main pillars. Recent activities have included organizing career panels for youth of color to meet professionals with shared lived experience; and facilitating mentorship collaborations between POCIE and cross-sector partner institutions. </p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--with""> <p>involved</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Getting involved with POCIE has served as a refreshing affirmation that our needs for community, collaboration, healing, connecting, and rest can and should be central to environmental work. The gratitude, joy, and community I have already felt in my short time with POCIE only reinforces how important this is for BIPOC in the environment. By building equity from the bottom up and allotting decision-making power across our community, POCIE attempts to make the world we envision internally a reality and take meaningful steps towards changing the landscape of the environmental field. It is exactly for these reasons that groups like POCIE need to exist.</p>

<p>All of our programming is completely free, and we welcome you to join our efforts to create an inclusive environmental movement for a racially just and resilient future.

961,Students Excel When Expectations for Them Are High,<p>Three New England school leaders on helping young people overcome obstacles and pursue lives of opportunity and choice.</p>,"<p>The 2022-23 school year marked a time rich with potential and hope, but the appearance of normalcy and feeling of relief have been tempered by the reality that COVID exacerbated many students’ pre-pandemic challenges. After two decades of progress, national math and reading scores <a href=""https://www.edweek.org/leadership/two-decades-of-progress-nearly-gone-national-math-reading-scores-hit-historic-lows/2022/10"">hit historic lows</a>. Many students are coming to school with emotional, physical, nutritional, and housing needs.</p>

<p>It can feel overwhelming to process all the demands and challenges that young people face in addition to their schoolwork. But what gives us hope and has inspired our careers as high school leaders is the belief in the potential of a high-quality education to help students overcome obstacles and pursue lives of opportunity and choice.</p>

<p>We believe students need rigor and purpose to meet their goals. Rigor challenges students to think critically and search for answers to tough questions. Purpose gives them relevant learning experiences that they can connect with their lives. With support and funding from the education nonprofit <a href=""https://www.springpointschools.org/"">Springpoint</a> and Barr Foundation’s <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/education/engage-new-england"">Engage New England initiative</a>, our three schools have created programming that is designed to help students meet the high expectations set for them — particularly students of color, those from low-income families, English learners and those with special needs. Our schools were designed specifically for students who had not been well served educationally, and as a result, many are not on track to graduate from high school when they enroll.</p>

<p>We have seen firsthand how our belief in the importance of maintaining high expectations translates into meaningful and challenging academic experiences and in students’ increased confidence in what they can accomplish.</p>

<p>At the Capitol Region Education Council’s <a href=""https://www.crecschools.org/for_families/impact_academy"">Impact Academy</a> in Hartford, students took their educational experience outside the classroom to apply their learning in real and relevant ways. An example of this is through the “Students and the Law” course. Impact Academy students collaborated with students from the University of Connecticut School of Law, culminating in a Moot Court exercise in which they took on the roles of petitioners, respondents and justices. This was new territory for many of them. They had to be prepared to present complicated arguments in a formal setting at the law school. They researched, practiced and worked together.</p>

<p>The school’s combination of high expectations and relevant learning opportunities has given them a purpose and created for the students a new postsecondary vision for themselves. Over two-thirds of the current graduating class plan to continue their education.</p>

<p>At <a href=""https://www.fallriverschools.org/durfee/student-life/evolve-academy"">Evolve Academy</a> in Massachusetts’s Fall River Public Schools, a Portrait of a Graduate was created that defines the essential skills and mindsets that students are expected to have when they leave. They are expected to develop the ability to argue, investigate, discern, collaborate, communicate and self-direct. For example, students participated in a project-based unit called “My Point of View,” in which they used storytelling to create a powerful and compelling personal statement that expressed their values. <div class=""Media -aside -left""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img alt=""Drawing of a young black superhero shooting lightening out of his finger.

Some 70% of students at Evolve report that they would have dropped out if they had gone to another school; now every 2023 graduate has a postsecondary plan in place.</p>

<p>At <a href=""https://www.nowellacademy.org/"">Nowell Academy</a> in Providence, educators work with students to set weekly academic goals. Pushing the students helps them build confidence that they can accomplish ambitious and worthy learning, while completing tasks that require them to create and produce solutions and arguments raises their expectations for what they can accomplish. For example, in the math unit “You Auto Know,” freshmen learn and demonstrate the mathematics of buying a car. 
<div class=""Media -aside -left""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img alt=""Two teenage girls in a school classroom looking at a computer screen together"" class=""Media-image"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/4451/crop_preview.png?1689351428"" /> <div class=""FancyAttribution""> <p>Yosalin Alvarado&#39;s You Auto Know presentation</p> </div> </div> </div></p>

<p>Student Yosalin Alvarado compared investing in a 2022 Honda Accord and a 2022 Honda Civic, analyzing the differences in base price, depreciation and gas mileage and the similarities of multi-year loan financing costs, insurance payments and brand. Then, she made final recommendations, as if presenting them to a client, about which vehicle to purchase. Such expectation-raising work has helped foster a college-going culture and boosted student engagement. One telling metric: 100% of Nowell seniors completed the federal financial aid form this year, while just a few years ago the FAFSA completion rate was 30%.</p>

<p>Learning at our three schools is not just about meeting graduation requirements, but rather about building skills and networks, providing opportunities to help students see what is possible and supporting them so they can excel. We expect students to be challenged, to apply their learning and to strengthen their own identities.</p>

<p>Even in difficult times like these, high expectations are not only possible, but necessary — for all students in all schools. Teachers must ask young people to do hard things. School leaders need to create rigorous and purposeful learning experiences that allow all students to meet and exceed the high expectations set for them.</p>

960,why we paused for joy again,"<p>An opportunity to practice resting, being in community, and imagining new relationships and possibilities.</p>","<p>Last spring we, like many others, were continuing to emerge from the ongoing pandemic. We noticed that just as COVID didn’t actually disappear overnight, the constant feeling of being on the precipice of (if not already experiencing) burnout remained in the atmosphere. Our community was tired, and we weren’t sure when people would get a break. So, we decided to try creating one. We called it &quot;a pause for joy.&quot;</p>

<p>Our assumption was that it would be a one-time thing. A sort of communal shaking off of stress and other cuffs that weren’t benefiting us. But the event was a success, we could feel the energy and joy in the air. Afterwards we received lovely notes like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to offer my sincere gratitude for your efforts in hosting the “a pause for joy” event last evening. In today’s political and social environments, a pause for joy (or anything else for that matter) is a rare and elusive gift. It’s been a long time since I was invited to eat, socialize, lounge in beautiful space, and just BE.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We knew (and know) that this work to help solve climate change, while also centering racial equity, is long work. It requires dedicated communities of people working together toward similar goals. What clicked after our pause was that just as people need opportunities to practice new skills, they also need the chance to practice resting, being in community, and imagining new relationships and possibilities. Moments like these are necessary for sustaining long-term work.</p>

<p>So, on June 1, 2023, we hosted chapter 2 and <em>a pause for joy</em> officially became an annual event.</p>
<h3>the people</h3>
<p>The gathering is for our local non-profit grantees, including volunteers and community members who make significant contributions. “Significant” is open to interpretation by our grantees, but we clarify that this is not necessarily intended to include board members. We also extend invitations to select individuals in the public and private sectors, those who we typically call “our partners” because they have done work directly with us in recent years or consistently work in collaboration with our grantees.</p>

<p>Saying “no” to some is uncomfortable, but a necessary part of the process. We want to maintain a welcoming and inclusive environment, while sticking to capacity limitations and a budget. It also gives us room to enthusiastically say “bring them!” when parents or other caregivers share that they’ll have to choose between the needs of their family members or attending, or when grantees share that they have an intern starting the day of the event. Both have happened each year.</p>
<h3>the event</h3>
<p><em>a pause for joy</em> is simultaneously a love letter to our grantees and partners, and what can be heard on the other side of the universe on days when we scream into the void out of frustration.</p>

<p>Ideally we would have time to thank each person for attending and their contributions to the collective work. But, this isn’t a wedding, so there’s no receiving line. Instead, we include a few personal touches that are especially meaningful to us. They are intended to serve as “hello”s from each of us on the Mobility Team, and include: multiple joyful and restful activities, an element of surprise, curated swag, sassy signage, flowers for guests to take home, and an inclusive food and drink menu that includes frosé (plus other cocktails and mocktails).</p>

<p>In addition to working to ensure that people feel our gratitude, we strive to make room for others by considering the different ways that people find joy at events. Our event planner, <a href=""https://www.mmeliteevents.com/"">Myriam</a>, ensures that in a single venue guests can choose how they’d like to be together – from mingling in a crowd to sitting quietly away from the noise.</p>

<p>We invite individuals to come as they are or want to be. Myriam and the broader <a href=""https://barrfoundation.app.box.com/s/g456s8zei4973j6itifx4bdhqh48kh4q"">team of people</a> who staff the event, make sure that the community is well taken care of. It quickly becomes clear that the most universal human experience is wondering where the bathrooms or closest garbage bins are.</p>

<p>There’s one primary rule: <em>you may not talk about work</em>. It’s not a cocktail hour, it’s a pause. By exploring who we (the collective) are as people and fostering interpersonal connections, we learn the value of each person beyond their jobs and strengthen our shared ability to solve the problems facing humanity.</p>

<p>We’re two for two on receiving positive reflections and requests to sustain this space. After this year&#39;s event, a parent shared with us:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I asked [child] if she had a good time, a great time, or an awesome time tonight. She responded, ‘did you know there’s something better than awesome? I had a WONDERFUL TIME.&#39;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And, an Executive Director who could not attend the event passed along this note from an advocate:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I did not bounce, but the food and drink was excellent, and the company was even better. Met up with some known advocates, who introduced me to some new friends. Got to talk with [municipal senior leadership] about non-streets things and it was great. It was really a pause for joy. Just good people getting together.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Connection, joy, and rejuvenation are essential ingredients for creating the impact that we hope to see in the world. We’ve heard from our community that <em>a pause for joy</em> is meaningful and worthwhile. We’ve already started drafting chapter 3.</p>

959,Embracing Risk and Adapting to Change During the Pandemic,"<p>How at the height of the pandemic, a Berkshire County arts organization defied the odds, expanding its services for people with disabilities.</p>","<p><strong><em>An interview with Margaret Keller, executive director, Community Access to the Arts (CATA) written by Pamela Reynolds.</em></strong></p>

<p>In the first year of the pandemic, arts organizations in Massachusetts were struggling to offer the programming and services they were known for - and many had to shut their doors to their audiences. </p>

<p>But one Berkshire County organization dedicated to nurturing the creativity of people with disabilities was able to defy the odds. Instead of shutting its doors, <a href=""https://cataarts.org/"">Community Access to the Arts (CATA)</a>, located in Great Barrington, MA, expanded, opening a 6,355 square foot arts center today serving more than 970 artists with disabilities annually. In the last three years, CATA has opened a gleaming new arts center, broadened its art workshops, hired new staff, and transitioned independent contractors into fixed part-time jobs. CATA’s unlikely expansion, happening as the rest of the world contracted, provides a glimpse of how one organization has reinvented itself in challenging times, thriving, surviving, and even flourishing.</p>

<p>“CATA&#39;s growth during the pandemic was incredibly powerful for all of us here,” reflects CATA executive director Margaret Keller. “There was so much that was unknown, and time moved so quickly… In the end, it was the power of our partnerships and the depth and intensity of those partnerships that helped us to see with clarity the need in our community.” </p>
<h3>Quick Thinking Early On</h3>
<p>In the earliest days of the pandemic, CATA’s full-time staff of eight got blindsided just like everyone else. The non-profit serves people with disabilities in schools, day-habilitation programs, and residences in Berkshire and Columbia counties. Its workshops in disciplines like painting, dance, theater, singing, drumming, and creative writing, have been an exhilarating entrée into unexplored talents, new friendships, and wider vistas for participants since its founding in 1993. Before the pandemic hit, CATA was doing so well that it offered 1,500 workshops led by about 25 independent faculty across different schools, residences, and day programs across 47 different program partners. In February 2020, the organization even celebrated the grand opening of a new art center where many workshops were to take place. The future looked bright.</p>

<p>Then the world changed. Reports of a deadly virus headlined the news every night. And the virus was no longer sweeping across only faraway countries like China and Italy; it had arrived in the Berkshires. Within a week, CATA watched its artists, their caregivers, and staff working at partnering schools and residential facilities fall ill and even get hospitalized.</p>

<p>“It got dramatic quickly,” says Keller. “We were talking to our partners, and they were dealing with a crisis of unimaginable proportions.”</p>

<p>The problem was particularly grave because of the population served by CATA. CATA artists include those with developmental and intellectual disabilities, Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injuries, and Prader-Willi syndrome, among other conditions, putting them at a much higher risk of contracting a severe case of COVID. In addition, many live in group homes in relatively close quarters, and the virus was pummeling those kinds of facilities. And at the time, there was no federal or state money to help out, either.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--staff""> <p>a</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>The answer to that question was counterintuitive: Go big and bold. It was something that many other arts organizations couldn’t afford to do, and if they could, might have avoided through sheer prudence. But instead of pulling back, CATA dipped into its reserves and ramped up course offerings. While the new art center could no longer host in-person classes it could be reshaped to serve as a socially distant Zoom base for faculty who could take advantage of the center’s strong internet connection to lead online courses. Amid all the tumult, Keller asked herself whether dancing and drumming workshops were what the community needed at a time of crisis. What she heard from schools and agencies confirmed her decision: CATA’s acting, juggling, and dancing workshops were exactly what people needed at a time of crushing anxiety, isolation, and loss.</p>

<p>“It was incredibly powerful to see how, through the arts, our CATA artists found connection,” says Keller. “They found engagement. They were able to express themselves creatively. They were still able to work on their own personal growth and personal development. And I think that ability to express themselves creatively was profoundly important at that moment in time.”</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--powerful""> “was” <span class=""u-nowrap"">incredibly</span> </blockquote></p>
<h3>Planning for a Rainy Day</h3>
<p>CATA, it turned out, was oddly positioned to leverage the crisis for growth. One reason was that it was prepared. Since 2018, CATA staff has participated in ongoing training with the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/arts-creativity/barr-klarman-massachusetts-arts-initiative"">Barr-Klarman Massachusetts Arts Initiative (BKMAI)</a> designed to help mid-sized arts nonprofits build financial health, adaptability, and organizational equity. Keller says that what she learned in the program became instrumental in helping the organization increase its capitalization and set aside money for a rainy day. During the BKMAI initiative, CATA more than doubled its organizational budget to $2 million.</p>

<p>That was lucky, says Keller, because COVID came and it wasn’t just raining, it was pouring.</p>

<p>“If we had not done that strategic work, I don’t know if we would have been able to be bold in the moment that boldness was called for,” says Keller. “We had really thought through what our reserves were there for. We recognized that this was the time to be prepared to spend it in service of our community. And that made a huge difference.”</p>
<h3>A Lifeline on the Ground</h3>
<p>On the ground, dipping into savings translated into transformed days for people like Scott Thomas, a resident of Leander House, a Great Barrington non-profit housing adults with intellectual disabilities.    <div class=""Media -aside -left""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img alt=""Artist holding a colorful painting and smiling while looking at the camera. "" class=""Media-image"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/4447/crop_preview.png?1689342934"" /> <div class=""FancyAttribution""> <p><a class=""FancyAttribution-link"" href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/communityaccesstothearts/albums/with/72177720299664490"">Scott Thomas via CATA</a></p> </div> </div> </div>
Instead of spending weeks and months on lockdown with zero stimulation and social interaction, Thomas was able to attend workshops in Shakespeare, writing, music, and painting.</p>

<p>Thomas says he looked forward to each Zoom session and “picking up new techniques.”</p>

<p>Jennie Reins, director of Leander House, says the CATA programming came at a critical moment for Leander House’s six adult residents. 
“It was a godsend for us,” she says. “People were getting stir crazy. It was mid-winter, and they (the residents) weren&#39;t seeing their friends. So they were able to connect with their friends, be involved with their classes again, at least, virtually.”</p>

<p>At a time when students globally found themselves losing social and academic skills, sometimes falling into depression as a result of isolation, having access to art workshops was a way to stay motivated and involved for CATA artists of all ages.</p>
<h3>Deepening, Not Just Expanding</h3>
<p>For CATA, the pandemic served as an unexpected stress test. The organization could see both its strengths and where there was room for improvement. Its strengths included committed donors and rock-solid community ties. Schools and facilities rely on CATA to provide services that nobody else is bringing to people in the area with disabilities. Growing steadily during the pandemic, CATA today runs 2,200 workshops in 22 school programs and 30-day-habilitation programs and residences. It has added five full-time staff members.  </p>

<p>But despite its growth, like many arts organizations, CATA still grapples with issues around racial diversity, especially in a county that is more than 90% white. Acknowledging this issue, CATA has looked for ways to reach more communities of color. One way has been through boosting its partnership in the Pittsfield Public Schools, the most racially and ethnically diverse school district in Berkshire County. CATA has expanded Pittsfield school offerings to include dance, juggling, acting, drumming, songwriting, and yoga. It’s also expanded in the district to 11 schools and 16 classrooms with more than 600 art workshops annually.  </p>

<p>The organization also took an internal assessment on equity issues, encouraged by what it had learned through its Barr-Klarman training. It turned to <a href=""https://www.multiculturalbridge.org/"">Multicultural BRIDGE</a>, a Berkshire grassroots organization to expand equity training for staff, faculty, and board members. 
“It sparked for us a whole conversation,” says Keller. “Who are we not reaching and why?” </p>

<p>Among the questions it has asked itself include what kind of factors might prevent a person of color from being diagnosed with a developmental disability in the first place. A formal diagnosis is often required to access enrichment programs and services. As part of its internal self-evaluation, CATA has also sat down with social service organizations, community groups, and churches to figure out how to better reach communities of color.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--of""> <p>part</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>“We just sat with folks to ask them; do you connect with people with developmental disabilities? Have you experienced or has anyone in your community experienced difficulty in obtaining a diagnosis? What do you know about CATA? What do you think about CATA?” says Keller.</p>
<h3>Lessons Learned for the Long Haul</h3>
<p>The past three years have given the organization ample ideas as to what’s helped them to thrive, even in the face of ongoing fundraising challenges that most non-profit arts groups face. Cultivating a sound financial base is important, but so are soft skills, including building a committed staff.</p>

<p>“There are a lot of lessons about being embedded in the community, about being bold when you need to be bold, about being nimble and flexible and listening to your community about what they need,” says Keller.</p>

<p>The pandemic underscored the importance of building relationships and, in Keller’s words, staying “supple.”</p>

<p>“I think we have a much more profound sense of gratitude for those relationships because of COVID as well,” she says. “Having strong and authentic relationships where people level with you and share with you their challenges, hopes, and dreams, that is how you create and co-create effective programs that serve the community.”</p>

958,"Undeterred, Our Work Continues",<p>Barr’s president responds to the Supreme Court ruling on affirmative action</p>,"<p>It was jolting to learn of the Supreme Court’s decision last week, declaring race-conscious admissions programs at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina to be unlawful, even if it seemed a preordained conclusion. While the Court’s decision narrowly focused on higher education, the door is now open to further legal challenges to affirmative action and race-conscious programs in other settings.</p>

<p>For organizations like our own, where advancing racial equity is a cornerstone of our work, the decision represents a devastating setback for us and our partners. Furthermore, Barr’s Education program is grounded in the unwavering belief that all students—regardless of who they are or where they live—deserve access to high-quality learning experiences that prepare them for college, career, and life. These are among the many reasons the Barr Foundation joined with many other allied philanthropic partners in adding our name last week to this <a href=""https://www.fordfoundation.org/news-and-stories/news-and-press/news/statement-in-response-to-the-us-supreme-court-s-decision-in-students-for-fair-admissions-v-university-of-north-carolina-and-students-for-fair-admissions-v-president-and-fellows-of-harvard-college/"">joint statement</a> in response to the decision.</p>

<p>My response here is a more personal one.</p>

<p>I spent part of this Independence Day weekend reading the full 237-page opinion issued by the Court. I wanted to understand for myself—without expert analysis or political spin to intermediate—how the majority justified its conclusion and how the dissenting justices framed their concerns.</p>

<p>I was particularly struck by this statement in Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s dissent:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today’s decision further entrenches racial inequality by making these pipelines to leadership roles less diverse. A college degree, particularly from an elite institution, carries with it the benefit of powerful networks and the opportunity for socioeconomic mobility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is indeed my story.</p>

<p>I have undeniably been a beneficiary of race-conscious programs that served to open doors, broaden my networks, and forge otherwise unattainable pathways. I was born into a tenuous lower middle-class background, at times relying on public assistance and support. There were no college graduates in my immediate family, and I was raised by my great-grandmother, an immigrant from Nicaragua, who spoke only Spanish.</p>

<p>And yet, it is absolutely the case that intentional efforts to broaden opportunity in a race-conscious manner contributed to where I am today: in a professional position of tremendous privilege—and yes, power—with two degrees from Stanford University, and living in a very different socio-economic context than what I experienced growing up. </p>

<p>My story is hardly unique, and that’s part of the promise of America.  But, with the majority of the Court essentially embracing the tired mythology of “colorblindness,” we are told to set aside the role of race. Again, quoting Justice Sotomayor from her dissent: “Ignoring race will not equalize a society that is racially unequal. What was true in the 1860s, and again in 1954, is true today: <em>Equality requires acknowledgment of inequality</em> [emphasis added].”</p>

<p>As we know from our own work at the Barr Foundation, efforts to dismantle systemic racism, counter racial oppression, and advance racial equity require that we reckon with our past. As our recent <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/a-learning-journey-to-alabama"">staff-wide learning journey to Alabama</a> made plainly evident, the road to equality requires that we understand, recognize, and rectify inequality.</p>

<p>That the Supreme Court would declare unlawful one of the most effective methods for achieving equality—despite mountains of evidence, countless stories like my own, and decades of legal precedent—is deeply saddening, discouraging, and even enraging. As Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote in her own separate dissent: “[D]eeming race irrelevant in law does not make it so in life.”</p>

<p>These decisions are about much more than legal analysis and intellectual disagreement; they profoundly influence lives. The reality now is that certain pathways to achievement will be significantly narrowed, if not entirely closed. Aspirations may be stifled, and opportunities for upward mobility will be diminished. These prospects should trouble us all.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--now""> <p>reality</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>As Barr’s president, all of this just underscores the imperative of the work we do each and every day, along with our partners, and it pushes us to reaffirm our commitment. Barr’s mission to invest in potential, guided by core values that include centering racial equity, is the same today as it was before this ruling.</p>

<p>I close with these powerful words from Justice Jackson’s dissent:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only way out of this morass—for all of us—is to stare at racial disparity unblinkingly, and then do what evidence and experts tell us is required to level the playing field and march forward together, collectively striving to achieve true equality for all Americans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Her words describe eloquently our own commitment at the Barr Foundation: together, in partnership, we will find our way forward to advance equity, expand pathways, and broaden opportunity.</p>

<p>We remain undeterred.</p>"
957,An Invitation: Help Inform Barr’s Racial Wealth Equity Strategy,<p>Seeking Greater Boston leaders working to expand access to wealth for 1:1 conversations with Barr’s Racial Wealth Equity Initiative team</p>,"<p>Since Barr launched its <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/special-initiatives/advancing-racial-wealth-equity-in-greater-boston"">Racial Wealth Equity Initiative</a>, one of our core commitments has been to continually learn from leaders in community – young people, experienced nonprofit leaders, community elders, policy makers, researchers, and other change makers. Our work to date was informed by conversations with dozens of leaders across Greater Boston. And we are going to continue actively listening and engaging as we work to evolve and refine our strategy. We know there are many we have not had an opportunity to learn from yet. </p>

Originally planned for April 2020, our trip kept getting deferred by COVID. While we were disappointed by these postponements, the racial reckoning of 2020 and the isolation and fracturing of community experienced during these COVID years made this long-anticipated experience even more meaningful. Though it will take time to fully process the experience and what it means for our work, I wanted to share why, as Barr’s leader, I felt it was so important to take this journey.</p>

<p><strong>Barr’s Context for the Trip</strong></p>

<p>Since 2016, we have devoted considerable time and resources to an organizational focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion. Our trustees adopted a new core value for the foundation to “<a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/advancing-racial-equity"">center racial equity</a>” and that explicit commitment is radiating through our grantmaking in our core program areas of Arts &amp; Creativity, Climate, and Education; in a <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/special-initiatives/advancing-racial-wealth-equity-in-greater-boston"">new initiative</a> focused on advancing racial wealth equity in Greater Boston; and in the policies, practices, and culture that manifest who we are as an organization.</p>

<p>In 2019, I joined our founding trustees on a trip to Montgomery and Birmingham that was centered on a visit to the <a href=""https://eji.org/"">Equal Justice Initiative</a> (EJI)’s Legacy Museum and National Memorial for Peace and Justice. It was a powerful experience, and we returned from it committed to sharing this opportunity with the entire Barr staff given our deepened work on racial equity.</p>

<p><strong>The National Context for the Trip</strong></p>

<p>Fast forward to today, with all that has transpired and shifted in recent years, the relevance of our trip only expanded. Across the country, political leaders are banning books, and the culture wars seem omnipresent. Our nation’s history is being denied to young people, in the name of protecting them from facing what might make some feel uncomfortable or ashamed.</p>

<p>In direct challenge to such impulses, I was struck on a walk in Montgomery by a quote on a white brick wall at the edge of a half-empty parking lot. Attributed to Maya Angelou, the quote read: “History, despite its wrenching pain, cannot be unlived, but if faced with courage, need not be lived again.”</p>

<p><strong>Why Alabama?</strong></p>

<p>I offer an anecdote to illustrate why a trip to the South was important to us: Bryan Stevenson, the founder of EJI <a href=""https://youtu.be/ggkYSBsxOik?t=1165"">tells a story</a> of an amazing encounter between a middle-aged black woman and a southern white man. Utter strangers, the pair found themselves together beside a dirt road in a rural corner of Alabama at the site of a long-ago lynching.</p>

<p>Together, they filled a clear glass jar with earth from that spot. Hundreds of similar jars line the walls of the Legacy Museum – a sobering tribute to remember and honor the deceased, who were victims of racial terror. Participating in that process, these two strangers faced a gruesome history together and were transformed by it. As Stevenson describes it, the two experienced a moment of transcendent grace.</p>

<p>Stevenson closes that story acknowledging that such moments don’t happen all the time. “But we deny ourselves the beauty of justice,” he adds, “when we refuse to tell the truth.”</p>

<p>Could we have faced these hard truths from our offices in Boston or on our screens from our home offices? Of course. Learning about our country’s history and the legacies of slavery, racial oppression and terrorism, and structural racism takes many forms.</p>

<p>And yet, what we could not have experienced in Boston was the visceral connection to that history and its legacy that being in Alabama offered us – what Stevenson describes as a “landscape littered with iconography celebrating those who defended enslavement” and propagating the false narrative of racial difference.</p>

<p>We would have also missed the moving, inspiring connections we were so fortunate to have with so many local people who welcomed us to their communities, shared their experiences, songs, stories, and such amazing food, with so much wisdom, skill, grace, and care. More than that, they encouraged us to continue to forge our own paths in the vital and necessary work of advancing racial equity.</p>

<p><strong>Fostering Community at Barr</strong></p>

<p>Having led our organization through the pandemic, with all its challenges, especially the isolation and dislocation of working at a distance from one another, one of my priorities for 2023 has been to nurture and sustain our community at Barr.</p>

<p>As we continue to evolve and live into a new hybrid work structure, I know what a tremendous benefit flexibility provides to our team, and how greatly people value it. I do as well. Yet, being in Alabama, I felt we all realized anew the power of togetherness and shared experience. Indeed, the communal time in Alabama was one of the ancillary benefits of our trip: sharing meals, walking around, riding the bus, having conversations without agendas, or calendar alerts, or our titles getting in the way of authentic, meaningful connection.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that it was a privilege for us to take this trip. It required a significant investment of staff time and financial resources. Yet, with privilege comes responsibility, and a significant part of our responsibility is to use our resources to advance justice. <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/the-human-factor"">As I have written here before</a> – channeling Alan Pifer, former President of the Carnegie Corporation of New York – philanthropy is fundamentally a human enterprise. This trip was an investment in our people.</p>

<p>Barr’s ability to advance justice depends in part upon our own team. And I could not be more proud of my colleagues’ willingness to face, grapple with, contend with, and reckon with our nation’s full history – the noble parts and the shameful parts – and to trace their threads to today and to our own lives. It demonstrated our collective willingness to learn, to grow, and to continue becoming the people we need to be to advance justice and the future that we seek.</p>

<p>That’s what this journey was all about.</p>"
954,What does it look like to center equity in HR?,"<p>Irina Cortez, Managing Director of Talent and Culture at Vote Solar on hiring, compensation, and advancement.</p>","<p>In the fall of 2021, the Climate Team invited grantees to participate in an <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/new-tool-for-climate-nonprofits-to-assess-progress-on-racial-equity"">organizational self-assessment</a> to reflect on their racial equity efforts. One of the themes that emerged from the assessment was a desire to learn from peers in the climate field working to advance racial equity. As a first response to that desire, we are excited to share a conversation with <a href=""https://votesolar.org/"">Vote Solar</a> - one of our grantees that participated in the self-assessment. Vote Solar is a national organization dedicated to a just and equitable transition to clean power across the US. Vote Solar’s mission is to realize a 100% clean energy future through a solutions-driven, people-first approach.  It achieves its mission by working on state policy advocacy and energy regulation. We spoke with <strong>Irina Cortez</strong> (she/her), Managing Director of Talent + Culture who shared some of the internal organizational equity work the organization is engaged in to strengthen hiring, compensation and advancement practices.  </p>

<p><strong>Tell us a little bit about what you do at Vote Solar.</strong></p>

<p>I’m the Managing Director of Talent + Culture at Vote Solar, which is basically all things human resources and talent management. I work with managers to hire and support team members across five pillars: Talent Acquisition and Retention, Internal Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Justice, Belonging, Effectiveness (or Talent Management), and Responsibility (otherwise known as Compliance). The role was created in 2020 to support Vote Solar in our work to grow and be more diverse while honoring the ask made by our BIPOC affinity group for more organizational transparency in our HR and Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Justice (DEIJ) efforts.</p>

<p><strong>Why is equity work important to the Vote Solar team?</strong></p>

<p>When our team members are supported by the organization, and receive equitable, transparent compensation, benefits, and advancement opportunities, we feel we are better positioned to fulfill our mission, which is a 100% clean energy future for everyone. </p>

<p>To do that, equity must be at the forefront. I’m most excited to share the work we’ve done around hiring and compensation. Perhaps other organizations will realize that they are not alone as we explore better ways of working. I’d love to build a network of organizations working on equitable and transparent compensation and hiring practices. </p>

<p><strong>What was it like to complete the Barr-sponsored racial equity organizational self-assessment and process the results?</strong> </p>

<p>We had four people who completed the assessment. This assessment confirmed other surveying we had done before: our human resource and talent management systems needed work and we needed to make hiring and compensation processes more transparent, since they <a href=""https://pages.hired.email/rs/289-SIY-439/images/2021%20Impact%20Report%20-%20Wage%20Inequality%20in%20the%20Workplace.pdf?mkt_tok=Mjg5LVNJWS00MzkAAAGBMLi7DLDt738e-q2NJKl1tsJNSfbMDO36_37cTYjHGKHrSSwnKs1IgAMQ98iK0JnxVmhuWfoulmZP0rIgzJvZhU_h3gnk_19pXnQOcAOXYP4BYQ"">disproportionately impacted women and people of color</a>. This was also the same for promotions and career pathways.</p>

<p><strong>Once you identified your priorities how did you go about implementing change?</strong> </p>

<p>We spent a lot of time in our hiring and compensation practices asking where are the gaps?  What do we need to do to ensure that everyone has access to the same information? That’s really critical. </p>

<p>We wanted compensation to be fair, transparent, and we wanted to make sure we were giving people a living wage. We referenced the <a href=""https://livingwage.mit.edu/"">MIT Living Wage Calculator</a> to set a base salary out of the rates for Oakland, CA. We decided that no one at the organization will make less than this amount, on the principle of ensuring everyone at Vote Solar, regardless of position, would earn at least a livable wage.  Then we conducted a compensation and benefits survey where we asked: “How are you engaging with these processes? How do you feel about our benefits?” We used that information to inform a series of focus groups, because part of the challenge was figuring out what the right mix of factors is to use when you’re making your compensation structure. </p>

<p>Ultimately, we made several organization-wide updates: </p>

<ul>
<li>We landed on a national pay structure for any role that is not dictated by location and a high-cost pay structure for roles that are required to be in a place where cost of living is higher.<br></li>
<li>We implemented a uniform cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) increase for everyone in the organization. We give COLA increases in January and include all staff, regardless of how recently they joined Vote Solar. Early on we realized that if we didn’t give COLA raises until staff had been with Vote Solar for a full year or tried to prorate it, we risked salaries getting out of alignment over time. </li>
<li>Additionally, we no longer allow salary negotiation, as this practice can lead to a significant wage gap between individuals who are skilled at negotiating and those who are not. We make sure to explain to candidates why we’ve implemented this policy, and we’ve received positive feedback. This decision promotes fair and transparent pay, particularly for demographic groups such as women and people of color, who have historically been paid less. </li>
</ul>

<p>In order to engage in this work, we first had to separate our personal knowledge of the people in their respective roles from the responsibilities and scope of the positions themselves. We began by evaluating the market data on these positions with a benchmarking study. It was important to emphasize that this analysis was not focused on individuals, but on the positions themselves. We aimed to determine a sustainable compensation structure that was also fair, equitable, and just for all.</p>

<p>One hard lesson learned for us through this process is that there is no single right way. Sometimes you have to make a choice, clearly communicate the rationale behind that choice, and then commit to checking to be sure you are okay with the outcome of your choice. </p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--to""> “you” <span class=""u-nowrap"">have</span> </blockquote></p>

<p>We have made a commitment to re-evaluating our practices and philosophy every three years. But we can still make changes on the fly, as long as we are transparent about why we’re making the changes and apply them equitably across our policies instead of on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p><strong>Are there any other highlights or successes that you’d like to share?</strong></p>

<p>Our hiring process is another story to highlight. </p>

<p>Initially, our organization&#39;s candidate profiles were rigid and limited the pool of candidates to those with similar backgrounds and experience. However, through our equity work, we’ve become more aware of our own biases and how they can influence our hiring decisions. We now allocate time at the beginning of a hiring process to discuss these biases and ask our team members to call out any biases that they may struggle with. For instance, we might say, &quot;I am aware that I have an &#39;affinity&#39; or &#39;like me&#39; bias, and if you notice me displaying this, please remind me of our conversation.&quot; This approach creates a positive environment that invites others to help us avoid biases, rather than feeling like a negative critique.</p>

<p>We all have biases. Acknowledging that you have them and having other people be on the lookout for you has been really powerful for us to overcome some of those biases in our hiring processes. </p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--biases""> “all” <span class=""u-nowrap"">have</span> </blockquote></p>

<p>We also developed a hiring rubric so that people are clear on what we’re looking for with each role. And we identify &#39;nice-to-haves&#39; (i.e., “This person brings this other dimension to a role - perhaps one we didn’t even know we were looking for.”) </p>

<p>Additionally, we now always list salary in job descriptions nationwide as a general equity practice. </p>

<p><strong>Can you share more about some of the successes you are already seeing with these hiring practice changes?</strong> </p>

<p>The hiring process I described evolved over the past three years. Over time and as a result of those changes, we’ve integrated more staff with diverse perspectives and backgrounds. These individuals have continued to shape our thinking. There is a positive feedback loop where diversifying has allowed us to think more and more creatively about our hiring. </p>

<p>One of the areas where we are continuing to evolve is identifying transferable skills. Some of our staff members, whose backgrounds are from outside of the energy or regulatory fields, have helped hiring managers refine their thinking on what core competencies are necessary for roles within Vote Solar. Identifying transferable skills is like looking at a basket of different fruits and, instead of saying “I want an orange,” you dig into what you might get from an orange. In asking those types of questions, you might get a better understanding of the nutrients you’re craving. So instead of “I want an orange,” you could realize that what you really need is vitamin C and you can get that from an apple! Transferable skills operate in the same way. For example, instead of looking for someone who has a background specifically in energy policy, we might broaden our lens to include all policy and then further to include strong researchers as a necessary skill set.</p>

<p>Vote Solar team members can expect to participate in one to two hiring committees per year. This helps us integrate the array of perspectives and networks from within the organization’s staff into each recruiting cycle. </p>

<p><strong>What sort of challenges have you and your colleagues encountered?</strong></p>

<p>There were several challenges: the hiring process and time allocated to hiring continue to be big ones. We are a pretty small team and it’s important for the candidates and the team to engage with each other. I think it’s important for the candidate to know who they’re going to be working with and get a clear sense of what’s expected of them and what they can expect day-to-day. Candidates are choosing us as much as we are choosing them. So being really clear about the time commitment for our internal team members and the timeline that our candidates can expect has been challenging. </p>

<p>With the compensation work, benchmarking is a huge undertaking. One thing that helped was being able to work with an HR consultant who had experience developing compensation philosophies and structures. I would absolutely recommend identifying a qualified consultant to help with this work, especially if you’re a small human resources shop. The consultants we worked with also first helped us define the compensation philosophy prior to showing us any numbers. It was really helpful to have someone who was keenly aware of what we were trying to accomplish. In addition, the fact that the consultant didn’t know any of the individuals in the roles helped us stay focused on the role instead of the person currently holding it.</p>

<p>Lastly, the career pathways piece - both within our organization and beyond Vote Solar - is still stumping us! We’re still trying to figure out what that looks like more fully. We’ve done some work including being much clearer about our leveling guide, which we’ve recently instituted. The leveling guide (also known as job classification) sets expectations and defines skills and responsibilities for each role and includes a pay scale for distinct levels. And in terms of promotions – we’re aiming to be more specific about each role and what it takes to advance. Some pathways are clear and others need a little more specificity to help people see the path and the needs ahead. This is a place where I’m really curious as to what other organizations are up to.</p>

<p><strong>Thank you so much for all of this!</strong> </p>

<p>Thank you! I’m really excited for this. Hopefully, this is helpful for other organizations who are doing this work. We’ve definitely not figured it all out - and I’m curious to know how other people are approaching their work. </p>

951,Arts Engage People in Bettering the Places They Love,<p>Leaders from two Massachusetts community foundations on how arts and creativity enrich civic life.</p>,"<p>Local arts provide a wellspring for community – energizing residents and enriching civic life. Our regions benefit from the remarkable ways that arts and cultural expression help people engage, connect, and contribute to more equitable, vibrant places. It happens on multiple levels.</p>

<p>Merrimack Valley residents join in municipal development through a question that goes to the heart of community life: “What is it about this place that feels like home?” People respond by naming the sites, from museums to parks and neighborhood settings, and contacts that matter to them.</p>

<p>Public officials recognize that these spatial and human touchstones represent belonging. By creating municipal plans – including policies for zoning, transportation, green spaces, and taxation – that reflect cultural practices in each locale they accelerate community and economic development.</p>

<p>“Pride of place is a really important piece,” said Greg Federspiel, Manchester town administrator. “We are a hollow shell if we don’t have that life and soul that the arts bring.”</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.elevatedthought.org/"">Elevated Thought</a>, a youth-focused arts and social justice nonprofit in Lawrence, compiled artist expressions of belonging in Merrimack Valley to complement the region’s cultural planning. Their publication, <em>Connecting Community</em>, carries emotive poetry, drawings, and photos. 
“Art can allow individuals the space to grapple with and define meaning both in an individual and collective way,” wrote Marquis Victor, executive director at Elevated Thought. “Through this project, members of our team were able to consider and reflect on the meaning of others; people geographically close but whose everyday reality is so drastically different.”</p>

<p>The Essex County Community Foundation invested more than $250,000 to demonstrate the impact of cultural planning in the fifteen cities and towns served by the Merrimack Valley Planning Commission. Positive outcomes are spawning broader adoption. Many local leaders envision cultural planning, including ensuring a seat at the municipal development table for artists and arts organizations, becoming a hallmark in the futures of all 34 Essex County communities.</p>

<p>Berkshire Taconic Community Foundation sponsored resident researchers to learn more about how people relate to arts in a region rich in cultural resources. These resources help define the Berkshires as a vibrant place for many but not all because of real and perceived barriers to engagement. The research team contacted 450 people living year-round in Pittsfield – including people of color, immigrants, youth, and people with low incomes – who reported that barriers such as cost, transportation, and social discomfort keep them away from arts venues. </p>

<p>These findings fed the design of <a href=""https://berkshiretaconic.org/initiatives-impact/community-engagement"">Arts Build Community</a>, an initiative now in its sixth year. To date, 60+ partners and nearly one million dollars in funds are creating pathways for all residents to be involved with arts as a powerful means to increase community engagement.</p>

<p>One inventive approach, by the <a href=""https://cpccommunity.org/about/"">Center for Peace through Culture</a> in Housatonic, equips ambassadors to connect underrepresented families with cultural experiences around the county. Volunteer Julie Haagenson was tasked with bringing a couple from her neighborhood to a performance at Tanglewood in Lenox. These older adults had a long-standing love of classical music though, despite living in Berkshire County for five years, they were intimidated to visit this fabled summer home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra.</p>

<em>Julie Haagenson, right, with fellow ambassador Laura Cabrera, left, and Center for Peace Through Culture’s Trudy Manion. The Center helped residents connect with Berkshire County arts through the Arts Build Community initiative of Berkshire Taconic Community Foundation.</em></p>

<p>Julie toured Tanglewood with its director of patron experience to prepare. She organized tickets, transportation, and a pre-concert meal at which the three neighbors talked about involvement with arts. “At the heart of what we’re doing is relationship building,” Julie reflected. “As an ambassador, I’ve experienced a whole series of connections that I didn’t expect. When we started thinking about it, we realized it’s about a sense of belonging.”</p>

<p>Creating welcoming spaces throughout the Berkshires’ many art forms and venues is core to Arts Build Community. Nearly 10,000 year-round residents in historically underrepresented groups are involved in arts through the initiative. Several projects help internationally acclaimed cultural institutions move into closer communion with the diverse population of the region. </p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--spaces""> <p>welcoming</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>For example, local advisors and resident inputs are now essential to designing program and outreach strategies at <a href=""https://massmoca.org/"">MASS MoCA</a> in North Adams. In Great Barrington, the <a href=""https://mahaiwe.org/"">Mahaiwe Performing Arts Center</a> convened a Spanish-language advisory committee to shape film screenings that drew nearly 200 attendees from a variety of Latin cultures. “It really felt like home for some people,” said Melissa Canavan, who coordinated the advisory committee. “It was great to see such a wonderful environment and exchange of dialogue.”</p>

<p>These stories from our distinct parts of the state speak to the ways that local arts nurture bonds and bridge divides. Research affirms these anecdotes. A wide-ranging study, <a href=""https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED598975.pdf"">The Arts and Civic Engagement</a> (Nick Rabkin, 2017) reported that people who engage with arts, especially those involved in creating art, are more likely to be active in their communities and to be making a difference in the lives of others.</p>

<p>Closer to home, research on <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/arts-creativity/culture-and-community-in-a-time-of-transformation"">Culture + Community in a Time of Transformation</a> (Slover Linett, 2021) shows that arts and creativity are deeply integrated in the lives of state residents. During the pandemic, 93% have done personal creative activities. In the years before Covid, 96% joined arts and culture activities in-person – with more than half directly participating in group art making like a community mural, play, or protest.</p>

<p>The advantages of local arts go well beyond the value they deliver to creative economies. There is an ample additional case for investing in arts as an engine for civic life. We encourage leaders from all sectors – including newly seated elected officials at the state and local levels – to embrace and expand the stunning public benefits that emanate from a resourced, resilient arts sector. </p>

<p>Arts are a community enabler that radiates belonging, connection, and caring. Civic life rises as people engage in arts. Ensuring that all residents have access to, and a voice in shaping, cultural assets in the places they love is a worthy goal. And it’s within our reach.</p>

950,Moving from Vision to Practice with School Transformation,<p>An update on the nine communities in a Portrait of a Graduate cohort as they make their plans a reality.</p>,"<p>For the past three years, the nine New England communities in the “Portrait of a Graduate” cohort have been taking steps to do high school differently to support more equitable outcomes and success for all students. They started by exploring the question, “What do we want all of our students to know and be able to do when they graduate?” Many conversations with students, families, teachers, local businesses, and other community members resulted in a collective vision for student success, also known as a portrait of a graduate. At its core, a portrait of a graduate is intended to serve as a north star for equitably serving all students and ensuring that when they leave high school, they are prepared for what’s next.</p>

<p>At Barr, we believe that building a community vision is an important step to anchor school transformation work. This vision should be centered on students, driven by local context, and informed by research. We support many Catalyze New Models grantees in developing and implementing a portrait of a graduate, including this specific Portrait of a Graduate cohort.</p>

<p>After developing their portraits of a graduate, teams of district and school administrators, teachers, families, students, and community members began laying the groundwork to bring their portraits to life.</p>
<h4>Common areas of work completed over the 2021-22 school year included:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Deepening their understanding of how their high schools currently did and did not align to the portrait of a graduate competencies, so that proposed solutions and changes would address the root causes of any key gaps;</li>
<li>Building momentum and deepening engagement of stakeholders around the need for change; and</li>
<li>Re-envisioning the student experience, including rethinking instructional practices and ways of measuring student learning.</li>

<p>In the current 2022-23 school year, the nine communities in the Portrait of a Graduate cohort are building upon last year’s groundwork and taking the first steps to implement changes in their high schools in response to their portraits. As part of that work, each community committed to focusing deeply on at least one of two areas: <strong>the depth and quality of student learning experiences, and/or the academic systems surrounding those experiences.</strong> These two focus areas are important indicators of school quality and are areas being explored by many of Barr&#39;s Catalyze New Models partners. Detailed information about the two focus areas is available in the <a href=""https://barrfdn.issuelab.org/resource/indicators-of-school-quality.html"">Springpoint Indicators of School Quality framework</a> (see Indicators 3 and 4).</p>

949,High Hopes for State's New Charitable Deduction,<p>A conversation with Massachusetts nonprofit leaders on the vital importance of giving by individuals and the opportunity this new law opens for the nonprofit sector.</p>,"<p>One of the most inspiring things about the U.S. nonprofit sector is that it is fueled by generosity. While organized philanthropy is a major source of support for nonprofits, its contributions are a fraction of what’s provided by the enormous generosity of individuals. In fact, individual donations are the largest source of charitable giving, making up nearly 70% of total giving in the U.S. in 2021.</p>

<p>America’s generous individual giving culture has long been amplified by policy incentives, including the well-known federal charitable tax deduction. This policy allows those who make donations to nonprofits to deduct qualified contributions on their tax return, creating a classic <em>win-win:</em> nonprofits gain by raising funds through giving programs, and individuals gain by reducing their tax liability and advancing a mission they care about. But due to changes in tax law, far fewer people take advantage of the federal charitable deduction today than they did even a decade ago.</p>

<p>However, a new Massachusetts law aims to encourage more generosity. Starting this tax year, Massachusetts taxpayers can deduct charitable donations on their state tax returns. This deduction is universal, meaning it is available to all Massachusetts taxpayers, whether or not they itemize their federal deductions. It also applies to all nonprofit donations, even those to charitable organizations located outside of Massachusetts. The hope is that more Massachusetts residents will give—and give more generously—with the knowledge that their contributions are deductible on their state taxes.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--year""> <p>tax</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Recently, I sat down with two Massachusetts nonprofit sector leaders to better understand the potential impacts of this new law for donors and nonprofits, and for advancing equity and democratizing the social sector. Here’s my conversation with Jim Klocke, CEO of <a href=""http://massnonprofitnet.org/"">Massachusetts Nonprofit Network</a> (abbreviated to MNN and Barr grantee), and Yi-Chin Chen, Executive Director, <a href=""https://friendsboston.org/"">Friends of the Children, Boston</a> (and MNN Board member).</p>

<p><em>This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.</em></p>
<h3>Rory Neuner (RN): We’re here to talk about a very exciting topic: tax policy! For over a century, our tax system has encouraged Americans to give back to their communities by providing tax deductions for contributions to charitable organizations. Why is the charitable deduction so important to the nonprofit sector?</h3>
<p>Jim Klocke (JK): The first thing I would say is that it provides both an incentive and a signal to increase giving. Many people want to give. But sometimes we need a nudge to do so—we&#39;re all human! If there is an incentive associated with something, we’ll see more of it. That&#39;s what the charitable deduction does.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--to""> “people” <span class=""u-nowrap"">want</span> </blockquote></p>

<p>Yi-Chin Chen (YC): Yes, Jim said it well. These incentives are also saying something important through policy. Think about the other incentives that tax policy creates – this legislation legitimizes charitable giving as something just as important as owning your home, pursuing higher education, and caring for your family, which are typically expenses that you can deduct on your return. By adding this to the list, it sends a message that charitable giving is something that folks should participate in.</p>
<h3>RN: Here in Massachusetts, we have some good news in this regard, right?</h3>
<p>JK: Very good news! Beginning January 1, 2023. Massachusetts now has a statewide, universal, charitable deduction. This is available to every Massachusetts taxpayer. That is, every Massachusetts taxpayer who makes a charitable contribution from now on can deduct that on their state income tax return. It&#39;s great because it provides that support, that incentive, that signaling, and it&#39;s also great because of its universality. The federal deduction is no longer available to most people. But the Massachusetts deduction is available to everyone.</p>
<h3>RN: This is really great news. Can you put this in the context of where the sector is in terms of giving? How has individual giving been changing over time – especially since the changes to federal tax law in 2017?</h3>
<p>JK: When the federal tax law was changed in in 2017, it raised the standard deduction, greatly reducing the pool of people who were able to itemize deductions. There were many people who had been donating and receiving a federal deduction—but since they’ve seen that deduction go away, they have been disincentivized from giving. That has reinforced a negative trend that we&#39;ve been seeing for the last decade or so, which is that the number of donors to many areas of the nonprofit sector has been shrinking. Some people are writing bigger checks, so total dollars appear to be stable, but the total number of donors has been shrinking.</p>

<p>And not only is that a bad thing writ large, but it’s also been shrinking among low- and middle-income groups – people whose donations are so crucial to helping organizations grow and diversify their support base.</p>

<p>YC: Yes. On the organizational level, we certainly see that trend, and what is most alarming is that you see the gap widening. Now the wealthy give through venues like donor advised funds, where there are tax incentives right out front. But the smaller donors or the mid-size donors don’t have access to the same carrots.</p>

<p>These smaller donors are giving simply out of their generosity, and not getting any incentives. And because of inflation and economic pressures, these donors have really taken quite a hit. And we’re hopeful the new Massachusetts State Charitable Deduction is the start of a more positive trend from this point forward.</p>
<h3>RN: You’ve painted a clear picture of how the deduction helps those who donate. What evidence do you see among our nonprofits about the importance of this new policy?</h3>
<p>JK: Well, the fact is that individual donations are an important part of the revenue model for nearly all nonprofits. The first time we did a member survey a few years ago, we asked the question “what types of revenue do you rely on?”</p>

<p>We listed 4 or 5 options. One option was government funding, and 50% said they rely on that. Other options included earned income, corporate gifts, and foundation dollars. A lot of organizations rely on those –60 to 70% of those who took our survey. But the top choice – 80 to 90% of respondents – reported that they rely on individual donations.</p>

<p>We often overlook how important the individual donor pool is to nonprofits. Anything that can encourage, strengthen, and diversify this pool is something that’s going to benefit nearly every nonprofit out there.</p>
<h3>RN: You’ve painted a clear picture of how the deduction helps those who donate. Yi-Chin, how does this impact nonprofit organizations like yours?</h3>
<p>YC: Friends of the Children - Boston is an organization that makes a twelve-and-a-half year commitment for every child that we select for our program, and that means that we have to rely on a diverse pool of revenue sources, including individuals of all giving levels. In fact, 90 percent of our individual donors will be beneficiaries of this new policy change, and I&#39;m just absolutely thrilled they have access to this.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--rely""> “have” <span class=""u-nowrap"">to</span> </blockquote></p>

<p>While I do firmly believe that our donors would give anyway—because they see our mission as a vehicle to align their vision of the world—this policy has the potential to stimulate an increase in their giving. In turn, that means we have more ability to be able to carry out our mission.</p>

<p>I also think that the new deduction can be a tool to level the playing field and bring about equity in fundraising for organizations and leaders that don&#39;t have the same access to resources and networks as some. For example, we know from numerous research and data that BIPOC-led organizations often don&#39;t have access to the same donor resources and relationships as similar white-led organizations. I think this will allow organizations to build a different fundraising model—one that can lead to greater participation in giving from a broader community.</p>

<p>Third, and last – this is the part that I think it&#39;s going to be really interesting – is how greater participation in giving from a broader community can create greater accountability for organizations. Organizations are guided by their stated missions; through donations and gift designations, donors support the delivery of those missions.  If you don’t have a diverse pool of donors from all corners of your community, there’s a possibility that a selective few can unintentionally have too much influence on your organizational priorities through their giving. Building a broader donor base can help balance the scales.</p>
<h3>RN: Let&#39;s move up a level, from organizations to the nonprofit sector as a whole. Why is the nonprofit sector so important to Massachusetts?</h3>
<p>JK: We have a large nonprofit sector in Massachusetts. 550,000 people work in the nonprofit sector. That&#39;s a bigger employment base than Massachusetts manufacturing and financial services sectors combined. Making sure that those 550,000 people are working for financially stable organizations is critical to a vibrant state economy.</p>

<p>Yi-Chin Chen: Our nonprofit sector is the connective tissue of our society, where idealism is realized and innovated into social impact. The sector’s work helps make our humanity whole.</p>

<p>In many communities, particularly marginalized communities, the social sector and the people who work in it help create better conditions in critical moments. Systems and policies take their time to create a transformation that they need – nonprofits are there in moments of need, and in the longer-term.</p>
<h3>RN: Let&#39;s talk a little bit about the timing of this policy change, and some of the challenges that the sector has been facing the last couple of years.</h3>
<p>YC: How long do we have for this?</p>

<p>[Laughter]</p>

<p>Seriously though—the social sector is never shy to step up. And everyone knows this story, but in the last couple of years, we’ve had some big events: a global pandemic, a racial reckoning. These events put a spotlight on how much more we have to do.</p>

<p>JK: The sector has been riding a demand roller coaster, an emotional roller coaster, and an overtaxed workforce roller coaster. There&#39;s been a financial roller coaster too. Early in the pandemic there was a terrific wave of new financial support to meet these increased needs. Philanthropy stepped up in a big, strong way right at the start, and that was great. The government stepped up with added funding, and a lot of those federal Paycheck Protection Program loans (PPP) turned out to be lifesavers for nonprofits.</p>

<p>We&#39;re a few years in now, and so the PPP loans are done. Some of that increased funding has continued, but many nonprofits are now financially strapped. Inflation affects the sector. Economic uncertainty affects the sector. The financial picture is still uneven. We hope that collectively, we can continue to make it possible to meet the needs that are out there. We also need to support the sector’s workforce, which was taxed, which did innovate, which was resilient – but which still needs our support.</p>

<p>YC: Coming through this pandemic, for the first time ever, I&#39;m beginning to hear more conversations about new things that we really need to pay attention to. It&#39;s really music to our ears that folks finally realize that equity matters. That mental health matters. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. And I think supportive public policy like this can make a difference in realizing our potential.</p>
<h3>RN: Who should know about this new policy? And what&#39;s your advice to nonprofit leaders for getting the word out?</h3>
<p>JK: We see three primary audiences. First and foremost: donors at all levels. Most people don&#39;t know about this yet, so the more who know about it, the more we can broaden nonprofits’ financial support.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--know""> “people” <span class=""u-nowrap"">don</span> </blockquote></p>

<p>The second, of course, is people who lead nonprofits. We want them to use this as a tool to encourage donations. The third is their colleagues who lead fundraising or development efforts in the nonprofit sector. I think people in the development business know the federal charitable deduction very well. It&#39;s a terrific incentive, and development professionals point to it to encourage giving. We want people to do the same thing with the state deduction.</p>

<p>YC: As an organizational leader, I’m speaking about this to my colleagues to really think about and take advantage of this. This is an opportunity for organizational leaders to go back to the fundraising playbook to say “who else can we really bring in? What other communities have we never thought of that should be a part of supporting our mission?”</p>

<p>This is something we can take seriously as an opportunity to rethink fundraising approaches. I represent a community-based organization, and I love building that ground up support. And I think this new policy has the potential to be able to shift more organizations in that direction.</p>

<p>JK: One other thing we like about this policy is that if you&#39;re trying to build support for your organization, any mechanism that begins to get people connected is a plus. Frequently, people begin to engage with your organization in one way, and then down the road they do more.</p>

<p>Maybe somebody begins with a donation. And that&#39;s their introduction, and they learn more about your organization, and then they become a volunteer, and then they become a board member. The state charitable deduction opens the door to encouraging much more engagement, not just financial support.</p>
<h3>RN: I thought we were just going to talk about taxes, but you have each shown how this policy has a much bigger impact. As our partners in the nonprofit sector think about how to take advantage of this new policy, where can they go for more information?</h3>
<p>JK: At MNN, we’re getting the word out and providing direct support to nonprofits. We began in January when the deduction became available, and we&#39;ll be doing it throughout the year. We anticipate that this will become especially important in the Fall, as everyone gears up for year-end giving campaigns.</p>

<p>We’ll work to spread the message throughout the year, because the state deduction is universal, and is usable by any nonprofit. There&#39;s really no limit to the number of nonprofits or the number of people across the State whom we&#39;d like to get this message out to.</p>

<p>We&#39;d love to partner with people in the development and fundraising business. So if you&#39;re in that line of work, and there are ways that we can be helpful to you, if there&#39;s information we can provide you, please let us know. We&#39;ve already crafted sample language for nonprofits to put in their donor letters. We can connect you with experts that will help you make the most of this of this new opportunity.</p>

948,Jamilah Bradshaw Shares Perspective as a New Arts & Creativity Program Officer,"<p>Jamilah Bradshaw joined the Barr Foundation in July 2022, bringing experience as a social justice leader to the Foundation. In this conversation, she shares the perspectives she brings to this new role.</p>","<h3>You’ve been at Barr for a while now. What surprised you most in your first few months as a program officer for Arts &amp; Creativity?</h3>
<p>I came to Barr from an organization that had over 100 employees. In contrast, the Barr Foundation has under 50 employees and is in a time of expansion. It has been cool to be a part of the new wave of folks joining Barr and to learn about the Foundation’s history and trajectory. When I moved to Massachusetts, the amount of compassion, grace, and generosity that was offered by my new colleagues was so welcoming. I didn’t know what to expect. People kept asking me “What do you need?” and “How can I help?” It speaks volumes about the culture at Barr.</p>
<h3>From your studies in psychology, African Diaspora, and Black Feminism to your work in community health and environmental justice, you bring multiple ways of thinking to this work. Tell us a bit about how your interdisciplinary background informs your grantmaking approach.</h3>
<p>I should say first that being part of the Arts &amp; Creativity team and being able to focus on the arts is a dream. I grew up in a creative family, with people who sang, danced, choreographed, and created art in many ways. Since I was little, I’ve been involved in theater, dance, and spoken word poetry. Growing up, I knew exceptionally creative folks who seldom got put on stage, were often overlooked, or found that a career as an artist was unsustainable. As I started to travel and meet more artists, I kept seeing the same thing.  Being able to be a grantmaker in this field, to support artists and arts ecosystems, feels spacious, like a big “yes.”</p>

<p>I’m from Oakland, California - a hub of movement-building, cultural innovation and diversity, youth activism, and intellectual rigor. Where folks make their own way when no others are available. I’ve been a youth organizer and cultural organizer, and I’ve practiced theater for social change. My previous role focused on achieving health equity locally and statewide through centering grassroots organizing and building people power across interrelated systems and focus areas. If anything, I have learned that when people connect their issues, map out plans, and make sure that all are cared for, then people can affect change. I think about: What are the issues facing artists? What are challenges in resourcing and proliferating the arts and how do they reflect and intersect with local, statewide, racial, and economic justice challenges?</p>

<p>Coming from work where I primarily engaged with movement builders to now engaging with arts leaders, I’m learning about the different questions to ask, the different things to listen for. And I’m bringing an awareness that while both communities may work to analyze and change local and regional conditions and to bring people together, arts leaders are also focused on creative work and the capacity to do that well.</p>

<p>We don’t live siloed lives, or as Audre Lorde put it, “There is no such thing as a single-issue struggle because we do not live single-issue lives.” So when we think about building just and healthy communities - where artists, arts, and creativity can thrive - we need to approach it in every generative way possible.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--sit""> <p>needs</p> </blockquote></p>
<h3>What led you to a career in philanthropy?</h3>
<p>It was not what I had in mind growing up or knew existed until I became an adult. I just knew I wanted to contribute to the health, well-being, and rights of communities. Working in the nonprofit sector - doing everything from service delivery to programming to grant writing - I’ve seen all the ways organizations will bend and stretch to get the grant or to build the right relationships with funders in order to be sustainable. And I always wondered what happens on the other side.</p>

<p>As I wondered about the world that funders were coming from, it also led me to learn about the ways in which folks from Black, Native, and im/migrant communities of color have always engaged in philanthropy — not just formal, organized philanthropy, but also informal networks like mutual aid. I started to learn more about mutual aid networks and legacies, like the social aid and pleasure clubs in Louisiana, where my mama’s folks are from.</p>

<p>That inquiry led me serendipitously to find out about a fellowship program that was placing community health advocates within The California Endowment (TCE), one of the largest private health foundations in the United States. This fellowship led to a permanent placement, and I got to work alongside brilliant folks with deep experience in philanthropy, grassroots organizing, public health and health care, social work, local government, state policy, and the arts.</p>

<p>Institutional philanthropy historically was built on a white savior, charity model. It was fraught with complications and has done harm. At TCE, I learned that philanthropy, if it is to be effective, must be accountable to the complex needs, ideas, and visions of the people. This understanding has brought me here to Barr, where there is a strong stance of being in authentic partnership.</p>
<h3>Barr has been working to embody a new core value to center racial equity. What does that look like for the Arts &amp; Creativity team?</h3>
<p>Artists have this uncanny way of leading by saying and doing the things that others won’t. They are the folks who dream big and who are bold and radical. When it comes to imagining and dreaming about what’s possible, artists are leading the way as multifaceted people: visionary thinkers, activists, conveners, organizers, educators, health practitioners, caregivers, and so on.</p>

<p>I believe that strong arts ecosystems characterize the livability, innovation, and liberatory and revolutionary nature of places. Although critical to social change, arts, and creativity continue to be sidelined. Artists’ needs sit at the intersection of multiple issues – housing, workforce, health care, sustainable economies – and the voices, decision-making power, and leadership of artists and creatives are critical in order to make substantive change.</p>"
945,Learning to Support Equitable School Transformation,<p>Barr evaluation partners from SRI Education share three insights on what it takes to design for and support whole school change.</p>,"<p>As foundations grapple with how to advance equity, many are seeking to <a href=""https://www.evaluationinnovation.org/publication/toward-a-trust-based-framework-for-learning-and-evaluation/"">reimagine learning and evaluation</a> in their grantmaking. In <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/to-center-equity-we-must-learn-differently"">a recent blog post</a>, Yvonne Belanger described how for Barr, centering equity has meant a more collaborative approach to evaluation that is inclusive of a wider range of voices, including grantee voices. This approach involves more purpose-driven learning with shorter cycles of reflecting and acting on varied forms of data and evidence.</p>

<p>One of the places Barr has begun to put these principles into action is the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/education/engage-new-england"">Engage New England (ENE) initiative</a>, for which SRI Education serves as the external evaluation partner. Barr’s Education Team launched Engage New England in 2017 as part of its strategy to Catalyze New Models of high schools. With this initiative, Barr set out to demonstrate how schools can support the success of all students—including and especially those who have not been well-served by the education system in the past and are currently off track to graduate from high school. To maximize learning, Barr approached the first phase of the initiative as a developmental stage, during which the Education Team and the initiative’s technical assistance partner, <a href=""https://www.springpointschools.org/"">Springpoint</a>, could adapt their strategy and supports as they learned more about grantee needs.</p>

<p>Specifically, Barr established multiple mechanisms for collecting information on initiative progress, including regular conversations between foundation staff and grantee leaders, monthly updates from Springpoint, and formative feedback from our team at SRI Education. Several key learnings about supporting equitable school transformation emerged from this process.</p>
<h3>Prioritize instructional improvement</h3>
<p>As Barr and Springpoint worked with grantees to design schools that better meet the needs of their student populations, they found that ENE schools had strong student–staff relationships but needed more support to make students’ learning experiences rigorous and purposeful. This finding is consistent with research on schools that predominantly serve students who are off track to graduate from high school. In response, the partners determined that instructional improvement had to be the “lead domino” for changing schools and students’ experiences therein. But as a Barr staff member noted, “What we could see was that [when school leaders said], ‘We will eventually or in parallel get to the instructional work,’ that wasn&#39;t happening.” Barr staff found that schools were juggling too many efforts to prioritize instructional improvement and needed outside support to maintain this focus.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--found""> <p>staff</p> </blockquote></p>
<h3>Select leaders with equity-aligned mindsets</h3>
<p>Barr sought to identify and develop ENE grantees that could ultimately serve as exemplar high schools. These schools did not have to be high performing at the start of the initiative, but their leaders had to be committed to the work. One lesson that emerged from the initiative was the importance of selecting leaders who shared Barr&#39;s vision for equity.</p>

<p>Barr identified two key equity-aligned mindsets leaders needed to be successful: an assets-based orientation including high expectations for students, and a conviction that staff development can transform instruction to better meet students’ needs. Most importantly, the foundation pressed to make sure school leaders believed all students could succeed and were not dismissing any groups. The Barr Education staff came to prioritize these mindsets over specific leadership competencies in selecting grantees because they found that leadership skills could be developed but mindsets were harder to change.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--two""> <p>identified</p> </blockquote></p>
<h3>Recognize that transformation requires a long-term investment</h3>
<p>As the ENE initiative evolved, Barr revised its expectations of the time horizon and investment needed to support change and create exemplary alternative high schools. By extending the initiative’s funding timeline, including the launch of Beyond ENE in 2022 for continued support for a subset of the school partners, the foundation acknowledged the reality that school reform is an iterative process that requires a long-term commitment. This understanding is consistent with studies of school design that have shown the necessity of lengthened planning and funding timelines,  and with the need to take the long view in assessing how organizational change impacts student outcomes. </p>

<p>Throughout the ENE initiative, Barr sought to balance having high expectations for progress with providing time for all the partners to learn and adjust. Additional learnings from the first phase of the initiative are summarized in a new research brief from the SRI evaluation team, <a href=""https://collegecareerpathways.org/publications/transforming-high-schools-to-serve-students-who-are-off-track-to-graduate/""><em>Transforming High Schools to Serve Students Who Are Off-Track to Graduate</em></a>. By sharing our approach to learning and some of the insights gained from Barr&#39;s ENE initiative, we hope to help inform other school transformation efforts.</p>

944,How Ready is Greater Boston for Climate Change?,"<p>Barr’s recent climate resilience survey reveals climate progress and greater climate awareness in Greater Boston, with room for advancement.</p>","<p>As the climate crisis continues, local governments must manage and navigate current and anticipated hazards. To support local municipalities in understanding and meeting the needs of their communities, the Barr Foundation’s Climate Resilience strategy team partnered with <a href=""https://www.stantec.com/"">Stantec</a> to develop <a href=""https://barrfdn.issuelab.org/resource/climate-resilience-analysis-a-rubric-to-measure-climate-resilience-in-greater-boston.html"">a survey and scoring rubric</a> to measure progress on climate resilience.  Climate resilience, as defined for this effort, is the ability of communities to prepare for, adapt to, and transform in response to the impacts of climate change.</p>

<p>While municipalities in the Greater Boston area are actively working toward resilience, most communities have not yet established the structures, systems, and enforcement mechanisms required to truly be ready for whatever a changing climate brings.</p>
<h3>Creating a Climate Resilience Survey</h3>
<p>Barr and Stantec identified and gathered a committee of practitioners across local governments, nonprofits, and planning agencies. This committee developed a survey and scoring rubric to measure municipalities’ climate resilience efforts and to identify barriers and opportunities to become more resilient.</p>

<p>The study assessed local municipal performance across five core indicators:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Climate Information:</strong> Accessing, understanding, and using climate information. </li>
<li><strong>Communication and Engagement:</strong> Communicating, engaging, and educating the whole community on resilience topics.</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal:</strong> Advancing climate resilience with limited funding resources. </li>
<li><strong>Development Policies and Procedures:</strong> Establishing policies and planning processes that encourage development in a climate resilient manner.</li>
<li><strong>Project Design Implementation:</strong> Designing, reviewing, or approving projects that promote climate resilience.</li>
</ol>

<p>The team embedded questions relating to social equity across the study, rather than having social equity exist as a stand-alone indicator. This decision is consistent with our view that centering equity must happen at every step of a process and a solution. Barr and Stantec then sent the survey to over 100 municipalities across Boston. Participating municipalities each received a personalized report explaining their placement and offering suggestions and frameworks for follow-up action and climate resilience improvement.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/4338/small.jpg?1678201017 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/4338/medium.jpg?1678201017 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/4338/large.jpg?1678201017 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/4338/x_large.jpg?1678201017 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""Stantec Graphic 1 high quality"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/4338/small.jpg?1678201017"" /> </div> </div></p>

<p><em>Pictured above: A visualization of the resilience rubric. Municipalities were placed on a scale from initiating to institutionalized to indicate their progress towards achieving climate resilience.</em></p>
<h3>Key Findings</h3>
<p>The complete report contains a number of important insights on the challenges and opportunities that come with embedding climate resilience into municipalities.</p>
<h4>Municipalities need more support and capacity to embed climate resilience data into planning tools</h4>
<p>The volume and technical nature of climate and resilience data can be overwhelming and difficult to distill into local decision-making. 97% of municipalities consider some climate information in planning, with 90% of those municipalities employing a tool known as a vulnerability assessment. While these numbers are heartening, unfortunately, a quarter of those who use the vulnerability assessment use it as their sole source of information in their climate preparedness planning. The quality and application of vulnerability assessments varies dramatically between communities, further complicating municipal preparedness.</p>

<p>Our survey also found that municipalities integrate climate data into other planning mechanisms (e.g. land use ordinances and building codes) on a more ad-hoc basis. There are  significant opportunities to help communities more successfully incorporate climate information into their planning mechanisms. Some possible avenues for municipalities to explore are community-to-community knowledge-sharing opportunities and technical assistance, though the most high-impact solution will vary based on each municipalities’ needs.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/4337/small.jpg?1678200277 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/4337/medium.jpg?1678200277 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/4337/large.jpg?1678200277 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/4337/x_large.jpg?1678200277 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""esaadfdasf"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/4337/small.jpg?1678200277"" /> </div> </div></p>

<p><em>Pictured above is a chart that shows the variety of ways that responding cities and towns incorporate climate information into various municipal-led planning efforts.</em></p>
<h4>Better oversight of private development increases climate resilience</h4>
<p>In addition to making resilience strides on publicly owned property, municipalities are aware of the need to manage private development. With limited control over private development projects, many municipalities are currently considering how best to require or encourage climate resilience. Municipal requirements can lag behind best practices for climate-resilient development as it takes time to turn today&#39;s best available information into regulations and requirements. While the majority of municipalities consider climate resilience beyond codified requirements, only three responding municipalities have resilience-focused review bodies with the authority to approve or deny projects.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -aside -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img alt=""Stantec Graphic 3 Climate Resilience"" class=""Media-image"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/4330/crop_preview.jpg?1677601134"" /> </div> </div></p>

<p><em>Pictured aside: 19 of the 27 responding municipalities (70%) promote climate resilience in reviewing private development plans, only three municipalities have climate-focused review bodies that possess the authority to approve or deny projects.</em></p>

<p>For approved projects, municipalities reported a lack of innovative approaches (or staff capacity) to ensure that project implementation matched what was approved, undercutting municipalities&#39; ability to ensure that resilient developments are as effective as intended. Our study found that municipalities would benefit from private project guidelines and procedures that support project review and oversight  from initiation to completion. Post-construction monitoring practices would also ensure that private developments deliver climate resilience as intended.</p>
<h4>Municipalities making progress on climate resilience are prioritizing equity</h4>
<p>A key goal of this project was to better understand how well equity is integrated into climate resilience efforts. How are priority populations’ needs and interests taken into account throughout resilience planning and beyond? Priority populations are defined as those disproportionately at risk from climate events due to pre-existing conditions (e.g. health, income, education); increased exposure (e.g. poor housing); and inability to recover after an extreme event (e.g. job loss or low financial resources); and structural racism.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -aside -left""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img alt=""Stantec Graphic 4 Climate Resilience"" class=""Media-image"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/4331/crop_preview.jpg?1677601471"" /> </div> </div></p>

<p>Overall, communities advancing toward climate resilience are also making progress on equity. The figure to the left shows the correlation between the responding municipalities&#39; Equity Sub-score and its relation to their Climate Resilience Overall Score.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -aside -left""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img alt=""Stantec Graphic 5 Climate Resilience"" class=""Media-image"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/4332/crop_preview.jpg?1677601501"" /> </div> </div></p>

<p>Beyond that, our findings revealed that municipalities with larger Environmental Justice (EJ) populations tend to prioritize integrating equity into their climate resilience discussions and plans. The figure to the left shows how Equity Sub-scores relate to EJ populations. However, we also found that three municipalities with larger EJ populations had lower equity scores, revealing an opportunity to promote equitable approaches to resilience where EJ populations are highest.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The Climate Resilience Survey revealed that most respondents are leaning into resilience, but are in the beginning phases of doing so, illuminating areas for improvement. In general, the survey results validated what many suspected: there is notable intent by communities to be more resilient, but the requirements and tools to do so (i.e., codification, enforcement, and measurement of resilience performance) lag behind.</p>

<p>More consistently integrating climate resilience into public planning mechanisms and private developments offers municipalities avenues to transform notable intent into tangible progress. The survey provided encouraging evidence that municipalities addressing climate resilience are doing so with equity in mind.</p>

940,New Funding Opportunity to Transform the High School Experience  ,<p>Barr seeks proposals from teams of high school and system leaders who are ready to meet the moment.</p>,"<p>Now is the time to challenge the status quo and move towards a vision of educational excellence that our students deserve. Many pandemic restrictions have been lifted and it is tempting to return to the way things were. Yet, the way things were was not working for many students. Too often, school and system structures, policies, practices, and belief systems limit access to opportunity and
contribute to inequitable outcomes for students of color, low-income students, students learning English, and students with special needs.  </p>

<p>The Barr Education Program supports high schools and school systems to fundamentally change in order to break the patterns that have prevented students from thriving. All high school students deserve an excellent educational experience that lifts up their strengths, provides meaningful learning experiences, helps them chart paths based on their passions, and prepares them to embrace the opportunities and challenges life will present. We believe that all young people – regardless of their background – can thrive in and beyond high school. </p>

<p>Barr seeks to partner with high schools and systems that are ready to embrace a pivotal opportunity to pause, understand the context and student need more deeply, challenge assumptions about how things need to be, and move toward a vision of excellence that our students deserve.  </p>

<p>This unique opportunity is intentionally designed for teams that combine leadership from both central office and schools to set a new, holistic vision of success, with a comprehensive strategy and roadmap to meaningful, deep, and lasting change. The year-long opportunity will provide time, resources, and facilitated support in a community of practice for school and system leaders to step out of the day-to-day whirlwind of urgent needs and come together for the necessary deep conversations and rigorous planning that this moment demands. </p>

<p>Applicants are invited to submit a proposal for up to $100,000 to support internal learning and planning, stakeholder engagement, and project management from July 2023-July 2024.</p>

939,Introducing Green Dash Northeast,<p>New interactive tool showcases progress toward energy transition in the Northeast.</p>,"<p>Have you ever wondered how Massachusetts compares to its neighbors in terms of  greenhouse gas emissions? Or how many clean energy jobs are being produced in each state in the Northeast? Over the years, our advocates and our grantees have had trouble understanding and comparing climate data since it is notoriously fragmented and hard to track. The Clean Energy strategic focus area of the Climate Program sought to make this information more accessible to nonprofit organizations, policymakers, and the public to stay informed about the region’s energy transition progress. By being able to compare and contextualize data related to jobs, energy, and emissions, we hope that staff at environmental NGOs, community-based organizations, and state and local governments have the data to support their work, studies, and recommendations.</p>

<p>Free and interactive, <a href=""https://www.synapse-energy.com/tools/green-dash-northeast-0"">Green Dash Northeast</a> allows website visitors to compare state-to-state climate information regarding energy and emissions in the Northeast. Using publicly available data, Green Dash Northeast aggregates, standardizes and offers standardized datasets and mapping tools to allow its users to assemble and analyze energy state-level data from a variety of sources.</p>
<h4>Users can explore and assemble data across the following categories:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Greenhouse gas emissions and targets</li>
<li>Electric energy generation and efficiency</li>
<li>Heating fuel sales</li>
<li>Battery storage</li>
<li>Clean energy jobs</li>
<li>Energy rates and energy burden </li>
</ul>
<h3>From Download to Dashboard</h3>
<p>Green Dash Northeast was originally developed as an Excel tool based on requests from grantees and other colleagues working throughout the region. After releasing the beta Excel tool, our grantees emphasized that we could increase accessibility and collaboration through a web-based tool. Developed through a consulting agreement between Barr and Synapse Energy Economics, Green Dash Northeast offers data aggregation and analysis to climate change-makers and policy advisors at organizations of all sizes. The hope is that with streamlined access and accessible data, our climate advocate community would gain context from neighboring states and make more targeted policy and programmatic recommendations. </p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>One of the updates in the web version that we are most excited about is the addition of mapping features. Green Dash is now able to offer visual insight into how the energy system impacts communities by mapping energy rates, social vulnerability, the percentage of household income spent on electricity and gas, and the locations of power plants and energy infrastructure. These data layers offer a more complete picture of how energy burden is distributed across the Northeast region. </p>

<em>Image from Green Dash Northeast mapping feature showing electric energy burden data and power plant locations.</em></p>

<p>In addition, the online dashboard offers supplemental resources for each topic area, offering easy access to information on policies and programs active in each state – allowing for compilations and tracking of policy impacts. With this information, users are able to more easily contextualize the data compilations and track both past policy impact and projected trend lines.</p>

<p>Users can also explore state-by-state data on greenhouse gas emissions and energy goals for both states who have created targets and those states who have not. That data can be seen comprehensively or on a per million-resident basis, offering both a full-picture and a resident-to-resident comparable analysis of the positive impact of policies and emission reduction targets.</p>

<h3>Climate Data Accessibility</h3>
<p>Despite an increase in web-friendly data science tools and climate information, the energy sector tends to lack transparency and/or accessibility. We applaud early efforts, like the recent <a href=""https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massachusetts-clean-energy-and-climate-metrics"">Massachusetts Climate Dashboard</a>, RMI’s beta <a href=""https://rmi.org/energy-policy-simulator/"">Energy Policy Simulator for New England</a> and the <a href=""https://www.theodi.org/article/industry-data-for-society-partnership-challenge/"">Open Data Initiative’s Local Environments Challenge</a> to share information dynamically with climate-focused organizations and the public. </p>

<p>Often, climate and energy data remains behind private paywalls, institutional logins, or buried in corners of the internet. We encourage philanthropic organizations beyond ourselves to create free and publicly-available frameworks to help our community leaders, advocates, policymakers, and governments in their implementation of climate and energy programs and future policy development.</p>

<p>Green Dash Northeast is currently available for use with desktop devices. The Barr Foundation and Synapse will continue to work together to keep the data in the Green Dash Northeast tool refreshed and updated. For more on the different metrics and how to use this new tool, we encourage you to visit and explore Green Dash Northeast.</p>

936,Change from the Inside Out,<p>What does prioritizing racial equity in an arts organization look like? A new series shares stories and reflections from Barr partners.</p>,"<p>It has been evident from my conversations with leaders of arts organizations across the state that the arts field has been transformed by both the pandemic and the racial justice reckoning. This took many shapes and forms, ranging from furloughs and layoffs due to pandemic program shutdowns to internal self-assessments and public call outs about how organizations need to meet the moment. These fraught times have been full of difficult changes in reaction to difficult circumstances. But they have also been full of proactive and inspiring examples of arts organizations re-imagining themselves and the roles they can play in their communities, as they build knowledge and skills to embed and advance more equitable practices.</p>

<p>One consistent theme in my conversations with arts leaders in recent years - they are hungry for an exchange of ideas. They know that their peers are wrestling with the same challenges and critical questions around equity and anti-racism.
<blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--theme""> <p>consistent</p> </blockquote>
Myriad questions have surfaced, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>What does it mean for an arts organization to take on political and social challenges of the times? </li>
<li>What to do when the staff’s vision gets ahead of that of the board?</li>
<li>How does one navigate long-time audiences and donors not seeing themselves reflected in the new goals of an organization and withdrawing their support? </li>
<li>How does one advance pay equity, when the business model might not support it? </li>
<li>How can an organization form more authentic and trusted relationships with communities they wish to serve? </li>
<li>What might new models of leadership and power sharing look like that could support greater equity within organizations?</li>
<li>How could organizations transform to support employee wellness and better work/life balance? </li>
</ul>

<p>Arts leaders long to hear case studies and promising practices – especially on the “brass tacks” of implementation. That’s why I am so excited to introduce a <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/arts-creativity/partner-stories"">new series entitled <strong><em>Change from the Inside Out</em></strong></a>. It shares grantees’ reflections, inspiring practices, and interesting ideas at the forefront of organizational change.</p>

<p>This time of great upheaval and reimagining deserves to be documented and shared, so that we can hold ourselves accountable to change and help propel it forward.  With the power of the Black Lives Matter movement and activism, we saw a lot of messages of solidarity and affinity, along with pledges to break down white supremacy and honor new commitments to racial equity. Several years on now, people of color are asking, “What’s changed?&quot; In this series, we offer a partial response. We have chosen to highlight organizations that are in the thick of the hard work of navigating new territory and learning how they can be more equitable. They are digging deep. We are capturing them at a moment in time on their journeys, sharing what’s working and lessons learned along the way. </p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--of""> <p>time</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>We want to thank our partners for being courageous enough to share their journeys. Executive leaders are still at a challenging crossroads, trying to keep their organizations afloat without a road map, while deepening their knowledge and expertise on becoming anti-racist organizations and leading organizational change management processes.</p>

<p>Our hope is that this series will be a brave space that can inspire leaders to connect, to be vulnerable with one another, to share strategies, and support one another on making the arts field more equitable. We hope that arts organizations will be accessible to all, bastions of belonging and inclusion in their communities.</p>

935,Francisco Torres Shares His Perspective as a New Member of the Arts & Creativity Team,"<p>Francisco Torres recently joined the Barr Foundation as Arts & Creativity Program Officer. A city planner by training, Francisco describes how the arts influenced his career and work in philanthropy.</p>","<h3>You joined the Foundation in July. What have you been thinking about in your first few months at Barr?</h3>
<p>I just came out of a meeting with the Climate team so top of mind for me is how we can find ways to work together across the Foundation and bridge the gaps between our priority issues.</p>

<p>I am very much a people person. I love meeting people, and I get my energy from talking with people. So one of the most important things for me in my first few months at Barr has been getting to know my coworkers and our partners. It’s so impressive to think about the ways that our team members are dedicated to their advocacy work and overall impact, and the ways in which our grantees are passionate about the work they do.</p>

<p>I am impressed with the reach that the Arts team has across Massachusetts as a whole. Although Boston is where our offices are located, there are so many communities across Massachusetts where we have an impact.</p>
<h3>You’re a city planner by training. What drew you to that work?</h3>
<p>Before I was a city planner, I traveled the US and other countries as a performer and dancer. When I was traveling and seeing different cities, I was always intrigued by the elements that make them vibrant and unique, whether it be a little coffee shop or a promenade. I’ve found that spaces are more vibrant when they are designed around and meet the needs of the people who use them.</p>

<p>Ultimately, that’s what got me into city planning - the admiration and curiosity for the ways in which places are designed and, more importantly, how they impact people’s experiences at a local level.</p>

<p>I try to bring this mindset of “people first” to my work. A great (and maybe overly simplified) example of this is when I walk my dog at the park. I’ll usually walk on the trails, but my dog isn’t staying on the trails. He’s running around, through the woods, chasing squirrels and finding his own path. He’s not thinking about how there’s a trail he needs to follow, and sometimes you’ll look into the grass to find an “undesigned” trail from people that have veered off to make their own path. This is because there is not one trail that fits everyone’s journey -  that’s not how people live their lives.</p>

<p>What questions does that raise for us as program designers? For me, I think the answer lies in getting to know the people with whom you are working to better understand their needs, and start there.</p>
<h3>How has that experience and your personal background as a performer informed your thinking and approach to grantmaking in the arts?</h3>
<p>I see this role as a perfect hub of my experience as an artist and as a city planner.</p>

<p>As a performer and in my current experience, I have found that if you look carefully enough, you can find art everywhere around you. Yet, I think a lot of people don’t recognize themselves as artists. For example, when I was growing up, we would have lots of get-togethers where my family would put on a little theater, music would be playing, and my friends and family would be performing. It touched every part of our lives. Did any of us call ourselves artists? I don’t think so, and I find this a common issue in my work. Because I believe everyone is artistic in some way, I think about how I can help people see themselves as artists and understand the ways that art and cultural activities play a role in their lives. To me, art isn’t an afterthought - it is a central and essential part of life.</p>

<p>In city planning, projects often involve taking a long-view approach, where you might work on a citywide plan for goals to achieve by 2050. I find this to also be the case at Barr as we’re not necessarily looking for systems change in a one-year grant timeline. Our investments often focus on how to improve things for the now but always with an eye toward the future so that it’s easier for artists to do what they do best - create art.</p>

<p>So, my experiences in taking the long view, combined with the belief that art is everywhere, influences my day-to-day interactions with grantees and program design. I try to maintain empathy for the artists facing struggles on a daily basis while trying to address the systemic issues that may cause harm within our communities. I have also been on the other side of philanthropy (by seeking grants), so I definitely bring an understanding of those needs to my work at Barr.</p>
<h3>Are there specific projects or initiatives you’re excited to be working on?</h3>
<p>I am excited to bring my city planning expertise to questions at the nexus of real estate and culture. In the near term, I’m just excited that this job allows me to view and participate in the art presented by our grantees. In the fall, I went to the American Repertory Theatre’s re-series of Anna Deavere Smith’s <a href=""https://americanrepertorytheater.org/shows-events/twilight-los-angeles-1992/"">Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992</a> about civil unrest in the wake of the Rodney King beating. Smith revised the piece for a five-person cast, where each person plays multiple roles, sometimes playing characters of a different race or gender. They did an incredible job, and I was in tears watching it and seeing how relevant it was today.</p>"
932,In Conversation: Seattle Waterfront Director Marshall Foster,<p>A virtual conversation about innovations and strategies driving progress along the waterfronts in Seattle and Boston.</p>,"<p>If you spend any time at all talking about cities and their waterfronts, you’re bound to hear about Waterfront Seattle. Seattle tops the list for strategies and innovations that have helped reimagine and rebuild an iconic waterfront. Their recent progress, and the story of how they got where they are is incredible.</p>

<p>To see what kind of ideas and inspiration we might glean from the other coast, I invited Marshall Foster, Director of the Seattle Office of the Waterfront and Civic Projects, to join me for a Barr Foundation &quot;In Conversation&quot; - a virtual discussion on the important work being done to transform Seattle’s waterfront, and the lessons we might be able to bring to our collective work to transform Boston’s waterfront to be more welcoming, fun, productive, and resilient.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full""> <div class=""u-fluid-iframe""> <div class=""u-fluid-iframe-inner""> <iframe src=""//player.vimeo.com/video/770432227?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0"" title=""Featured Video"" frameborder=""0"" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen loading=""lazy""> <a href=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/770432227?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0"">A video on Vimeo</a> </iframe> </div> </div> </div></p>

<p>Even with the inevitable technical glitches, we covered a lot! Here are three of my top takeaways (with links to those parts of the conversation):</p>

<p><strong>Takeaway #1: A Dedicated City Waterfront Office Makes Big Change Possible.</strong>   </p>

<p>At the outset of Seattle’s efforts to overhaul its waterfront, the City engaged a wide range of stakeholders — including, state and city departments and leaders, local businesses, and community organizations — to develop and adopt a single vision for the future of the waterfront. A key component of advancing that shared vision was <a href=""https://vimeo.com/770432227#t=33m10s"">the creation of Seattle&#39;s Office of the Waterfront and Civic Projects</a>. Responsible for coordinating the City&#39;s waterfront improvement efforts, the office plays a host of roles, including project management, design, construction, and financial management. Importantly, they keep close relationships with key community groups to sustain excitement and buy-in from all those involved in the visioning process, and to keep the focus on action - not the “analysis paralysis&quot; that plague large-scale projects in almost any city.</p>

<p>Boston and other waterfront cities would do well to take a close look at Seattle&#39;s Office of the Waterfront and Civic Projects.</p>

<p><strong>Takeaway #2: Consistent Community Engagement Can Transform a Place &quot;Just For Tourists&quot; into &quot;Our Place.”</strong></p>

<p>The community and civic groups the City of Seattle engaged in the initial planning of the waterfront have remained engaged in the project. They now serve as a consistent voice advocating for waterfront issues - even through changes in state and city elected leaders. These same groups also work with the Office of the Waterfront and Civic Projects to ensure all communities feel welcome at the waterfront, and to support programming that brings local artists, speakers, activities, and festivals from throughout the region to the waterfront’s new spaces.</p>

<p>When Marshall started his work, Seattle locals <a href=""https://vimeo.com/770432227#t=29m01s"">used to describe the waterfront as a place just for tourists</a>. Now, they see it as their own, and as a place where all of Seattle’s diverse communities and cultures feel welcome and at home.</p>

<p><strong>Takeaway #3: Diversified Funding Enables Bold Plans and Sustainable Action.</strong></p>

<p>Beyond ensuring buy-in on a shared vision for Seattle’s waterfront, the city also worked to secure <a href=""https://vimeo.com/770432227#t=12m50s"">diverse funding streams</a> for the effort — a combination of investments from philanthropy, the business community, and the public — which has made it possible to sustain both enthusiasm and financial support. According to Marshall, of the 20 acres of parks and public spaces currently being built along Seattle’s waterfront, a whopping third of that is privately funded.</p>

<p>I am so grateful for the time Marshall gave us for this discussion, and I will continue exploring how to engage other colleagues from around the country in conversations about the challenges, opportunities, and innovations on their waterfronts. I welcome suggestions for people you’d like to hear from next.</p>"
930,Boston Public Schools Showcase Innovation Amid Ongoing Challenges,<p>Four high school options provide inspiration for what's possible.</p>,"<p>In many ways, this new school year looks like a return to normal. But alongside the more familiar, deep and persistent challenges remain in many districts, and these concerns were exacerbated during the last two years. In Boston and across the region, we are faced with the challenge of not merely “returning to normal” because we know that normal was not supporting all students to be successful.</p>

<p>I have the privilege of working with dedicated school leaders across New England who are setting bold visions with their community to intentionally define their school purpose and model so that all students thrive in their high school and leave their K-12 education fully informed about their options and prepared to pursue their goals. There are school leaders committed to multi-year journeys to transform curriculum and instruction, the most important drivers of equity and excellence for students. Bright spots, representing the fundamental change we need to see in schools, exist. Coupled with an understanding of the deep concerns and challenges, bright spots provide an opportunity to show what is possible – not because their work is done and should be simply replicated – but because they provide inspiration for what could be.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--school""> <p>are</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Below are four high school options in Boston launched over the last decade that deserve recognition and can serve as inspiration for what’s possible in this time of change in the Boston Public Schools and across New England. These examples blend the lines between high school, college, career, and community and demonstrate that rigorous, purposeful learning experiences can be a core part of school, rather than on the periphery. They provide inspiration that it’s possible to design a school for all students – including and especially those who have been historically marginalized – to build the knowledge, skills, experiences, and social capital to pursue their dreams.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.munizacademy.org/""><strong>Margarita Muñiz Academy</strong></a> in Jamaica Plain is the first dual-language high school in the district, and is home to educators who work closely with students, families, and the community to prepare students for higher education, careers, and civic leadership.</p>

<p>The arts, technology, wellness, and a focus on culturally responsive approaches are underpinnings of their work. Striving for excellence, Margarita Muñiz Academy recently engaged their community to define their school’s “Portrait of a Scholar,” which describes what they want all students to know and be able to do by the time they graduate. The school is now establishing a “city as a campus” model to help make their portrait of a scholar a reality. Students are embarking on internships, dual enrollment opportunities, community service, and expeditions to learn in a broader context and acquire all the knowledge and skills identified in their portrait of a scholar.</p>

<p>One of the partners in the city as campus model is the <a href=""https://hale1918.org/climb-the-mountain/intrepid/""><strong>Intrepid Academy at Hale</strong></a>, launched in 2018 with Barr Foundation support, which brings high school students and their teachers to a 1,000-acre preserve southwest of Boston each day for a semester of outdoor learning focused on leadership, community-building, and wellness. Students participate in the semester-long experience as their main education option, engaging in interdisciplinary and experiential curriculum based in nature while meeting state standards for math, science, and humanities.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.digitalready.org/""><strong>Digital Ready</strong></a> offers comprehensive programming for BPS students in grades 11 and 12, and recently graduated (“year 13”) students that combines college, work-based learning, and rigorous academics.</p>

<p>In partnership with local industry and higher education partners, Digital Ready focuses on STEM-tech pathways that put students on a path to economic mobility. In addition to their Boston studios, Digital Ready is the key partner for an existing high school, SeaCoast High School in Revere, as they convert into <a href=""https://www.citylabrevere.com/"">CityLab Innovation High School</a>. CityLab is reimagining the high school experience by using the city as a lab for learning so students can experience relevant and college-and-career-connected learning. The Revere partnership is an example of what is possible for Boston to sustain a new model as part of the high school ecosystem.</p>

<p>A Brighton-based Horace Mann (in-district) charter middle and high school, <a href=""https://www.bostongreenacademy.org/""><strong>Boston Green Academy</strong></a> offers a unique environmental science and technology program and helps students find their individual paths after high school. Only five years ago Boston Green Academy became a full school for grades 6-12, serving about 500 students from every neighborhood and background in Boston. Now, it stands as <a href=""https://www.bostonpublicschools.org/school/boston-green-academy"">one of the most improved and innovative in the district</a>. </p>

<p>It’s a model that “ignites curiosity and allows students to push past their preconceived ideas of what they can achieve.” 
<div class=""Media -aside -left""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img alt=""Boston Green Academy photo from Commonwealth"" class=""Media-image"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/4266/crop_preview.png?1667494293"" /> <div class=""FancyAttribution""> <p><a class=""FancyAttribution-link"" href=""https://www.bostongreenacademy.org/"">Boston Green Academy</a></p> </div> </div> </div>
Boston Green is continuing to deepen its impact with a concentrated focus on increasing instructional rigor.</p>

<p>It’s important to reflect on examples of ingenuity that can be living models for schools all over New England. It’s not enough to just see them as one-off bright spots. The intentional – and ongoing – journeys of these education options to transform core learning experiences for all students can be supported and scaled. Across each of these examples, students, families, and educators continue to be engaged in co-designing and refining the vision and model. <span class=""InlineTweet""> <span class=""InlineTweet-content"">must</span> <a class=""InlineTweet-cta"" href=""https://twitter.com/intent/tweet/?dnt=true&amp;text=be""> <svg width=""48"" height=""48"" viewBox=""628 -718 2048 2048"" class=""Icon"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg""> <path d=""M2417.2-86.6c1.2,17,1.2,33.9,1.2,50.9c0,517.3-393.8,1113.4-1113.4,1113.4c-221.7,0-427.7-64.2-601-175.7 c31.5,3.6,61.8,4.8,94.5,4.8c183,0,351.4-61.8,485.8-167.2c-172-3.6-316.2-116.3-365.9-271.4c24.2,3.6,48.5,6.1,73.9,6.1 c35.1,0,70.3-4.8,103-13.3C916.1,424.7,781.6,267.2,781.6,76.9c0-1.2,0-3.6,0-4.8c52.1,29.1,112.7,47.2,176.9,49.7 C853.1,51.5,784-68.4,784-204.2c0-72.7,19.4-139.3,53.3-197.5C1030-164.2,1319.6-9.1,1644.3,7.9c-6.1-29.1-9.7-59.4-9.7-89.7 c0-215.7,174.5-391.3,391.3-391.3c112.7,0,214.4,47.2,285.9,123.6c88.4-17,173.3-49.7,248.4-94.5c-29.1,90.9-90.9,167.2-172,215.7 c78.7-8.5,155.1-30.3,225.3-60.6C2560.2-211.4,2493.6-142.4,2417.2-86.6z""/> </svg> Tweet This </a> </span></p>

<p><em>This article <a href=""https://commonwealthmagazine.org/education/boston-public-schools-showcase-innovation-amid-ongoing-challenges/"">originally published in Commonwealth Magazine</a> on October 27, 2022.</em></p>"
929,Kathryn Wright Shares Perspectives from her First Year at Barr,<p>Barr's senior program officer reflects on her career in clean energy and what excites her about her new role at the Foundation.</p>,"<h3>You’ve been at Barr since January 2022. What surprised you in your first few months as a senior program officer?</h3>
<p>I came to Barr from one of our grantee organizations, so I was used to being on the other side of the table, either applying for grants or as a researcher. I didn’t have a full picture of the operation.</p>

<p>One area that surprised me was our team&#39;s approach to strategic communications. Our grantees have done excellent work creating a steady drumbeat of climate-related articles in our regional media outlets.</p>

<p>So I had been seeing all of this coverage and only realized when I joined Barr that it was part of my new job! And it’s become one of my favorite areas of work, so that was a very pleasant surprise.</p>
<h3>You bring deep experience in renewable energy and energy efficiency, having worked across sectors on policy and implementation. How has your background shaped your approach to philanthropy?</h3>
<p>My background does inform how I structure grants. Specifically, how long I assume things will take.</p>

<p>When I was a consultant, I worked with a lot of cities on energy policies, from the beginning of forming an idea, through research and data analysis of potential impact, all the way to implementation.</p>

<p>What I’ve seen is that, even for something simple, it can take three to four years to take something from idea into fruition. That informs how I approach grantmaking. Longer timelines are necessary, even when people have the best intentions, because of the policymaking apparatuses and the practicalities of trying new things. In clean energy, many ideas are new and have limited examples to follow. We need to factor in the startup costs. You just don’t know how things will evolve when trying something new.</p>
<h3>What led you to get into this area of work?</h3>
<p>It’s not a straightforward answer! I received a scholarship to study marketing at the University of Pittsburgh, but it wasn’t actually what I wanted to do. I wanted to study environmental science, but when I declared a second major in environmental science, I lost part of my scholarship. Pennsylvania was gas country at the time, and it wasn’t exactly a promoted career path. (I ended up talking to the academic office and they got things straightened out.)</p>

<p>I focused on tropical ecology, which many people think sounds fun, but my fieldwork was in the rainforest. I spent a month in a hot, humid hut with no human interaction, using a calculator through a ziploc bag. I wondered if this was how I wanted to spend my life.</p>

<p>I loved the science of ecology, specifically energy and system flows, so I pivoted and went to graduate school in industrial ecology at Yale. I wanted to take the industrial ecology approach of mapping energy and waste flows in industrial processes and companies, and apply the same concepts to energy and carbon reduction in cities.</p>

<p>After graduate school, I worked with a small consulting firm in Boston that was very focused on local issues. We worked on local, community-directed clean energy planning in cities and towns across Massachusetts years before that became a popular concept, so it was fun to be a part of that. I was also driving all across Massachusetts facilitating public meetings about what people wanted to see in the future of energy, so it was a nice way to get to know a new state.</p>
<h3>What is unique about energy challenges and solutions in the Northeast and Massachusetts?</h3>
<p>A couple of things are unique, and I’ll start with what’s positive. We have a lot of political will in the Northeast and Massachusetts, with some of the nation&#39;s most ambitious climate and energy commitments. You don’t quite understand how important that is until you’ve worked somewhere that isn’t the case.</p>

<p>But what’s challenging about our unique situation is that our energy system is tied together regionally. In larger states like Texas or California, the system is state-wide. But in the Northeast and New England, we have a regional system operator connecting the electricity grids from Connecticut to Maine.</p>

<p>So even though we have individually ambitious states, we have a lot of diverse perspectives and dynamics that make it complex. We also don’t generate much electricity in New England, so we have to work with Hydro Quebec in Canada and New York to import power, adding another complex dynamic.</p>

<p>There are goals to change this with offshore wind, but if you look at our electricity grid and power mix now, we have much less renewable energy than other parts of the country. That’s why our <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/climate/clean-energy"">Clean Energy portfolio</a> is structured the way it is. We work from Connecticut to Maine because that’s how regional energy planning is done.</p>
<h3>Our clean energy partners are doing incredible work across the region. Are there specific projects or initiatives you’re excited about?</h3>
<p>The communications collaboration that I mentioned before allows our grantees in Massachusetts to increase their impact through greater collaboration on communications. It also allows us to present research coming out of universities in a useful way to advocates, simultaneously providing researchers with salient messaging that will help their research reach a broader audience.</p>

<p>Another initiative I’m excited about is the collaboration of several of our grantees on reforms to the Mass Save program, which is our statewide energy efficiency program in Massachusetts. The program has a public oversight board to ensure that it serves everyone.  However, unfortunately, it has still done a very poor job of serving low to moderate-income homeowners, renters, and people who speak English as a second language. Even though everyone pays into the program through a portion of their utility bill, not everyone has benefited equally.</p>

<p>Many organizations made this inequity a central point of their advocacy, and in response, the public oversight board, which is called the Energy Efficiency Advisory Council, hosted feedback sessions and created an equity working group. The working group includes several of our partners, including Clean Water Action, Conservation Law Foundation, Healthcare without Harm, and the Metropolitan Area Planning Council. Participants in the consultative process also included Acadia Center, Alternatives for Community and Environment, GreenRoots, LISC, Massachusetts Climate Action Network, and Neighbor to Neighbor.</p>

<p>The pressure these organizations put on the Mass Save program resulted in several changes to the energy efficiency program, including a new program that provides enhanced incentives to community-centered energy campaigns and a new initiative targeting rental properties and landlords.</p>

<p>Ensuring Mass Save is implemented equitably is so important, because many organizations across the country look to Massachusetts as a leader in energy efficiency. Our programs provide a model for other states, so when we can make strides in equity, it affects our neighbors and beyond.</p>
<h3>Racial equity is a core value for Barr and increasingly drives our grantmaking across portfolios. How do we need to think about equity when it comes to energy efficiency and renewable energy?</h3>
<p>We need to start by recognizing that fossil fuel infrastructure sited in communities of color has imposed an outsized burden on those communities. We also need to acknowledge the environmental health impacts of these legacy infrastructure systems.</p>

<p>Some of that was siting that was done intentionally, through redlining policies and restrictive covenants. There were aspects of restrictive covenants that were tied to access to green space that directly affected how certain communities were coded. This legacy can be seen today through energy burden because areas with less green space tend to be hotter and need more mitigation.</p>

<p>Often, because of how our energy system works, these processes were extractive and not sending wealth back to those communities.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--that""> <p>know</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>So, if we are building a clean energy and climate strategy that is focused on transitioning to a better energy future, it is impossible for us to ignore the history of injustice. We have to think about how those communities have been burdened, who benefits from the transition first, where renewable energy gets sited, who owns the new systems, and how we build a path to community ownership.</p>

<p>To do this work well, we have to ask these questions. We know that our previous systems came with a lot of harm, pain, and suffering. With that knowledge, we have a duty to do better.</p>"
928,Top Five Urban Parks Ideas from the 2022 Greater and Greener Conference,<p>Our Boston Waterfront Initiative director shares five inspiring ideas for our waterfront from a recent learning journey in Philadelphia.</p>,"<p>With fall cool in the air and Boston’s leaves starting to turn, I didn&#39;t want to let any more time pass before sharing the top five most inspired ideas from our summer gathering at the Greater and Greener Conference in Philadelphia, presented by the <a href=""https://cityparksalliance.org/"">City Parks Alliance</a>. I had the opportunity to travel to the City of Brotherly Love with a group of Barr&#39;s waterfront grantees and other partners. We joined mayors from cities large and small, community organizers, landscape architects, philanthropic innovators, journalists, urban planners, and transportation and environmental influencers from across the country. The first live “Greater and Greener” gathering since 2019 in Denver, Colorado, it was such an inspiring trip. I asked folks who joined me what left the strongest impressions on them and what Boston could learn from the presenters, panelists, participants, and our host city. From their comments (below, in their own words), I heard five inspired ideas:</p>
<h3>Inspired Idea #1: Creative, Varied, Targeted Public Access to Industrial Spaces</h3>
<p>Boston has a rich industrial waterfront history. From the 1600’s to today these areas continue to serve an important economic and social role for the city. While conversations today often focus on the tricky balance between industrial water dependent uses and non-water dependent real estate trends, less energy has been invested in breaking down the invisible barrier between working waterfronts and their abutting neighborhoods. With imagination, intentional planning, and collective effort, it’s possible to create exciting, welcoming spaces that will add new life to Boston’s waterfront and shine a light on the importance of these spaces to the overall economic health of the city.</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking a lot about how inspiring it was to walk Phase One of the Rail Park with ED Rebecca Chan, and to see an industrial reuse open space project that is underway with a quarter mile section complete but still a long way to go towards their end goal of three miles. The smaller section that is open now truly feels like a restorative oasis in the city. Visiting the space, experiencing its effects—literally feeling the cooling effects of trees and vegetation on a hot day, and hearing about their diverse public programming was a good reminder of how open space in the city can be small but mighty.”</p>

<p>“I especially appreciated going to the Delaware River waterfront where historic piers have been transformed into public spaces, each with their own identity from the high design of Race Street to the industrial grit of Cherry Street (complete with art studios and paletas) to the pop-up carnival at Penn&#39;s Landing. It was interesting to imagine an alternative universe where the Seaport&#39;s finger piers had evolved into something more closely resembling this.”</p>

<p>“Going to the Waterworks highlighted the multifaceted uses of a city park in an equitable manner: private receptions happening alongside fishing and exercising.”</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img alt=""Group of people walking on an elevated bridge in an urban park - industrial buildings on the left, green leafy trees on the right"" class=""Media-image"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/crop/4818/wide_crop.jpg?1665520030"" /> <div class=""FancyAttribution""> <p><a class=""FancyAttribution-link"" href=""https://cityparksalliance.org/"">City Parks Alliance</a></p> </div> </div> </div></p>
<h3>Inspired Idea #2: Authentic Engagement of Diverse Stakeholders</h3>
<p>Much of the neighborhood-level work around the harbor is focused on amplifying community voices and reserving their seat at the table when important decisions are made. Part of the challenge in this work is that deep, authentic engagement requires time and resources. To undo a long history of exclusion from its public process, Boston must commit to a future of inclusion.</p>

<p>“We found it valuable to learn from how Philadelphia is engaging key partners—specifically youth and older adults in authentic community building and mobilization.”</p>

<p>“I went on a &quot;walking tour&quot; (by bus) to meet small parks friends groups, and I was so excited to see how a structure for enabling local groups to adopt and program small parks can activate all sorts of spaces. The City of Philadelphia&#39;s systems feel so much more collaborative than what most folks experience when trying to work with DCR or Boston Parks, especially when it comes to event permitting and small repairs.”</p>

<p>“When revitalizing parks it&#39;s important to maintain and support the existing, organic uses - work with those existing users to come up with a design and operations plan.”</p>

<p>“Even if the park itself it not displacing existing people (i.e. in a post-industrial area with no existing residents), it can contribute to gentrification at the city/neighborhood scale - so it&#39;s important to think about who the park is serving and centering those that need it most.”</p>

<p>“You can&#39;t change a community without their participation.”</p>

<p>“Historic exclusions means that we have to work hard to promote inclusion.”</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img alt=""Two women in an urban garden sharing vegetables and a smile."" class=""Media-image"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/crop/4823/wide_crop.jpg?1665521260"" /> <div class=""FancyAttribution""> <p><a class=""FancyAttribution-link"" href=""https://cityparksalliance.org/"">City Parks Alliance</a></p> </div> </div> </div></p>
<h3>Inspired Idea #3: Prioritize Access for People, Not Cars</h3>
<p>As we think about remaking some of Boston’s current waterfront spaces (like Moakley Park) and creating new resilient ones, we must ensure that design and usability prioritize people and reflect the varied ways in which they will arrive, utilize the space, and get back home. Strong public spaces reflect important connections between parks and recreational spaces and other city services from housing, transit, economic development, and more.</p>

<p>“The Schuylkill River waterfront, which I explored both on a morning run and at the closing reception, felt like a world where Roxbury and the ICA were right on the Charles River. I appreciated the racial diversity of the folks spending time along the waterfront and the volume of people relaxing along the length of it that I explored. Although there were places where cars drove near the water, the quiet contrast to the buzz of Storrow made it feel even more pleasant and spread people more throughout the park.”</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img alt=""A group of bicyclists biking away from the viewer on a urban park bike path."" class=""Media-image"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/crop/4817/wide_crop.jpg?1665519838"" /> <div class=""FancyAttribution""> <p><a class=""FancyAttribution-link"" href=""https://cityparksalliance.org/"">City Parks Alliance</a></p> </div> </div> </div></p>
<h3>Inspired Idea #4: Robust Programming and Amenities</h3>
<p>The experience of diversity and interconnection speak to the importance of open space planning and programming that is intentional, inclusive, and creative. From the micro to the macro, the most engaging public spaces incorporate different design elements – from swings, to playgrounds, walking paths, and sports fields – that create opportunities for different types of events and programming to occur.</p>

<p>“The importance of youth education in parks - parks have the potential to make good people!”</p>

<p>“Free time is like a petri dish - it can grow good or bad bacteria (idea of programming parks and having places for kids/teens to hang out that is safe, healthy and fun).”</p>

<p>“Parks that serve families can help to offset gentrification issues associated with parks/green infrastructure - things like playing fields, food kiosks, youth programing can serve everyone regardless of income/background.”</p>

<p>“Observation: Philly loves hammocks and swings in public spaces! I saw 5+ parks, plazas, beer gardens, bars, etc with hammocks. We should add them to Boston parks.”</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img alt=""Urban park full of people with a red letter sculpture spelling out the word LOVE on a pedestal in the center"" class=""Media-image"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/crop/4816/wide_crop.jpg?1665519475"" /> <div class=""FancyAttribution""> <p><a class=""FancyAttribution-link"" href=""https://cityparksalliance.org/"">City Parks Alliance</a></p> </div> </div> </div></p>
<h3>Inspired Idea #5: Preserve Natural Uses and Honor Sacred Spaces</h3>
<p>As we envision and plan for the next generation’s waterfront, we should remain committed to highlighting the diverse history, uses, and impact the harbor has had on residents and visitors alike.</p>

<p>“The presentation about Singapore stayed with me thanks to the notion of the city being embedded in nature - as opposed to the other way around. We often approach policy with the idea that we can bend nature to our will....but we can&#39;t fight Mother Nature.”</p>

<p>“My visit to the historic African American Eden Cemetery outside Philly showed me the importance of using sacred spaces to honor the legacy of those who fought for freedom. Established in 1902, Eden is the oldest existing Black owned cemetery in the United States. Among the notables buried there are abolitionist William Still and contralto Marian Anderson.”</p>

<p>Boston’s waterfront is already a treasure. But it could be so much more so, for many more people than the few who already benefit from and enjoy it today. The waterfront also has enormous potential to help Boston achieve its goals of becoming a more inclusive, equitable, thriving, and climate resilient city. Achieving that potential requires robust funding, inclusive planning strategies, and a willingness to spot and implement good ideas, no matter where they come from.</p>

927,Five Community-Driven Actions for Change in Arts and Culture Organizations,<p>Cultural researcher Matthew Jenetopulos recaps a series of convenings across Massachusetts focused on turning research into action.</p>,"<p>This spring, my colleague, Jen Benoit-Bryan, president of <a href=""http://www.sloverlinett.com/"">Slover Linett</a> wrote about <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/arts-creativity/culture-and-community-in-a-time-of-transformation#research-massachusetts"">Massachusetts findings</a> from the national <em>Culture &amp; Community in a Time of Transformation</em> research supported by the Barr Foundation. <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/ma-residents-deeply-value-the-arts-and-hope-for-change"">She shared</a> how vital arts and culture organizations are to communities in Massachusetts, who have high rates of arts participation, and that most Commonwealth residents want to see arts or culture organizations change to become even more relevant to, and reflective of, their communities.</p>

<p>This post shifts our focus towards action. I’ll share five data-driven action options for arts and culture organizations and practitioners reflective of community priorities that we developed in collaboration with our team of advisors across the state.  I will also provide an example from a Massachusetts-based organization on the leading edge of action in each of these areas. These examples and insights were initially shared during Massachusetts regional convenings (video clips featured below) that paired community research findings with reflections from local arts and culture leaders about how they’ve worked in each action area.</p>
<h3>1. Become an anti-racist organization and combat systemic racism</h3>
<p>A main finding in our study was that a substantial minority of Massachusetts residents believe that systemic racism is present in arts and culture organizations—from 20% to 47% depending on the type of organization in question. In the <a href=""https://vimeo.com/697191010"">Berkshires convening</a>, we heard from Gwendolyn VanSant who is the founding director and CEO of <a href=""https://www.multiculturalbridge.org/"">BRIDGE</a> (Berkshire Resources for Integration of Diverse Groups through Education). She has partnered with many arts and culture organizations on cultural competence training and internal work toward equity and inclusion. Gwendolyn emphasized how critical internal anti-racism work is to do in order to engage authentically in this work with communities.</p>

<h3>2. Seek deeper community participation and collaboration</h3>
<p>Two-thirds of residents in Massachusetts wanted to see arts and culture organizations collaborating more deeply on programming with their communities. During our <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4np5ywYh-A"">South Coast and South Shore presentation</a>, Margo Saulnier, Creative Strategist at <a href=""https://newbedfordcreative.org/"">New Bedford Creative</a> (and an advisor on this study), shared about how their team updated the Wicked Cool Places Grant after seeking, receiving, and acting on feedback from the community. Originally, the grant was designed as a place-making grant program, but they found it was overlooking members of the community who were already contributing to community spaces. They simplified the application process, shifted their focus more toward community organizers and artists, and reframed their purpose towards place-keeping as well as place-making.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“[The way we originally positioned this grant] was incredibly insulting if you were a resident of New Bedford, especially if you were a resident that had been and has been contributing to your neighborhood and community for years. This came to light when we did a series of conversations with BIPOC artists…and through these conversations we made several adjustments to our process to make it more equitable.”</em> – Margo Saulnier</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>3. Support all people in feeling welcome to your space, programs, or events</h3>
<p>When asked what the most important qualities of arts and culture organizations are, nearly two-thirds of Massachusetts residents (62%) said it is to be welcoming for all kinds of people. In our Boston presentation, Ben Hires, CEO of the <a href=""https://bcnc.net/"">Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center</a> (BCNC) reflected on the work BCNC had done during the pandemic to host Covid-19 vaccination clinics for their community. They were able to leverage their position as a familiar and welcoming space for the Chinese-speaking community to increase the comfort of community members while getting their vaccines.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“What was special about [the vaccination clinic] being at our arts center is that being a welcoming known location to the Chinese-speaking community is important. This was really important at a time when language access and accessibility was a challenge for non-English speakers. Community members had no doubt that they would be welcome and would have a smooth process here.”</em> – Ben Hires</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>4. Explore your digital frontier (and the new audience it brings)</h3>
<p>Another key finding from our study was the vast number of people who were engaging with arts and culture online (74%) and how, for many organizations, people were engaging online that had not visited in person in the past few years. When we presented in Worcester, we heard about digital experimentation from Zach Coombs and Issa Coulibaly, co-founders of <a href=""https://crocodilerivermusic.com/"">Crocodile River Music</a>, an organization that brings African music, art, and dance to schools and educational settings. After operating entirely in-person for 10 years, the pandemic forced them to shift and create digital teaching tools—not to supplant the in-person work they did, but to supplement that work. And one of the benefits they talked about was being able to reach audiences in parts of the country that they would never physically travel to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“We were just in person for 10 years and we kind of felt like, without being in person there was no way for our work to be successful. And then the pandemic hit and we realized “We don’t have that option” so now it’s not just what we can do in-person but it’s also: How can we augment with the digital and double down on that so what we’re doing in-person can be a part of it, but not all of it. And if there’s someone in Kansas City we’re never going to go see. We go up and down the East Coast but we’re not driving west, but we have something they need an digital is the way we can get it to them. ”</em> – Zach Combs</p>

<h3>5. Find your role in social change</h3>
<p>We found that more than three-quarters of Massachusetts residents (77%) want arts and culture organizations to step up to address social issues—especially systemic racial injustice (46%), income inequality (37%), and climate change (35%). In our <a href=""https://vimeo.com/697191549"">Western Massachusetts conversation</a>, we heard from Carlos Uriona, Co-artistic Director and Ensemble at <a href=""https://doubleedgetheatre.org/"">Double Edge Theater</a>. He spoke about the ways they start every new planning process in their organization with values-based questions and exploration, opening themselves up purposefully to different perspectives and views both from within and from the community as well.  This supports the creation of art around the social issues that are important to them and brings in new perspectives that help them broaden and grow their priorities. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“We never start envisioning something from a funding or monetary perspective. The first question that we always ask ourselves is: what are our desires? And then the plan comes from the responses that we all give to that question. What actions are we willing to commit to and are we willing to show up for these actions to sustain them over time?”</em> – Carlos Uriona</p>

925,New Tool for Climate Nonprofits to Assess Progress on Racial Equity,<p>Self-assessment helps organizations evaluate and benchmark efforts to change culture and ways of working; and helps funders better understand partners’ efforts and how to target resources.</p>,"<p>In my previous <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/money-talks-here-s-what-we-want-it-to-say"">blog post</a>, I discussed the steps we are taking on the Climate Program team to assess how our work can better reflect Barr’s core value to center racial equity.</p>

<p>Open conversations and honest feedback from our grantees have been critical—both in terms of what Barr can change and how we can best support our partners’ related efforts. That’s why we commissioned an organizational racial equity self-assessment tool.</p>

<p>In the fall of 2021, we engaged Maricela Piña and Nayeli Bernal at Community Centered Evaluation and Research (CCER) to develop a <a href=""https://barrfdn.issuelab.org/resource/baseline-findings-from-the-racial-equity-organizational-self-assessments-of-barr-foundation-climate-program-grantees.html"">self-assessment</a> for organizations to reflect on their racial equity efforts and to help them benchmark progress over time.</p>

<p>In this post, I’ll be sharing information about our process, the tool, and key findings. While we recognize that the self-assessment is just one way to obtain a snapshot of racial equity practices, it is our hope that organizations in the climate movement (including philanthropic organizations) will consider taking concrete steps to examine their own organizational practices and culture.  It is also our hope that other funders will dedicate resources to help their grantees align their expressed intentions with their actions. We believe that lasting change will result when organizations in our field are willing to engage in uncomfortable conversations, execute plans to strengthen areas they have identified, and learn from and support each other.</p>
<h3>The Process</h3>
<p>The tool CCER developed drew upon the contributions of many experts in the racial equity field. As we worked with CCER to design the organizational self-assessment for our grantees, we prioritized creating space for our grantees to shape the tool that they would be using. We formed a compensated advisory team, comprising grantees from across the program to help steer and inform each phase of the process. 
We also tried to be clear in our expectations: this is a self-assessment, not a test. Honest self-reflection is essential, and organizations will only get out what they put in. Recognizing that people would have questions and concerns, we organized an informational webinar and made ourselves and our consultants available for conversation about the self-assessment.</p>
<h3>The Tool</h3>
<p>What CCER created was a self-assessment that offered an opportunity for organizations to reflect on their internal and external work to advance racial equity.</p>

<p>We aimed to be comprehensive and gathered information about:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Respondents’ demographic information</strong>, including position, tenure, and experiences at the organization</li>
<li><strong>Organizations’ internal efforts</strong>, such as learning activities, communications, and operations - for staff, board, and committees</li>
<li><strong>Organizations’ external efforts</strong>, such as the organization&#39;s competencies on community engagement and inclusion, as well as power and systems analyses </li>
<li><strong>Organizations’ previous history</strong>, including successes, challenges, and opportunities to work on (including places where additional support would be welcome) </li>
</ul>

<p>In creating a tool to gather all this information confidentially, we ended up with three slightly different versions tailored to the respondent’s role: Leadership, Staff, and Board.</p>

<p>After receiving the completed self-assessments, CCER created an Organization Profile for each grantee which provided a score for various dimensions of their internal and external work, as well as reflection questions to prompt discussion among staff, leadership, and board members.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--that""> “would” <span class=""u-nowrap"">ask</span> </blockquote></p>
<h3>Key Findings</h3>
<p>While full details and findings can be found in <a href=""https://barrfdn.issuelab.org/resource/baseline-findings-from-the-racial-equity-organizational-self-assessments-of-barr-foundation-climate-program-grantees.html"">a summary report</a>, here are some high-level findings that we’re excited to share:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Climate nonprofits welcomed the chance to use this new tool.</strong> We made this self-assessment available and optional for all our current grantees. 81 organizations (90% of current grantees) chose to invest the time to complete the self-assessment. </li>
<li><strong>Barr and our partners are mission-aligned.</strong> 96% of respondents reported that centering racial equity fits within their mission and that they include racial equity in their work.</li>
<li><strong>Climate grantees are in varying stages in their progress.</strong> Almost half (46%) are in the early stages of racial equity development. 

<ul>
<li>Grantees in the early stages reported less meaningful mechanisms of including community voices, and were more likely to identify senior management, board members, or funding sources as an impetus for engaging in racial equity work. </li>
<li>Organizations led by people of color reported more advanced practices across both internal and external dimensions. They reported more practices reflecting deep engagement with their communities, and less often reported development of working groups and internal structures specific to racial equity.</li>
</ul></li>

<h3>Continuing the Work</h3>
<p>After participating organizations were provided with their profiles, we received feedback on how the racial equity self-assessment prompted or accelerated conversations about areas of growth. We are eager to continue to learn about actions our grantees are taking, as well as hear about the continued challenges they face. We’re dedicated to learning together with them, being reflective about how we can keep improving, as we work to ensure our program’s resources are going to those organizations who are operationalizing their commitments to racial equity.</p>

<p>To date, this process has affirmed our intention to set a clear direction – for Barr and our partners–without expecting that everyone go at the same pace or approach the work in the same way. We view this effort as an ongoing, iterative learning exercise for ourselves and our partners. We are thankful for the feedback that we’ve received thus far about the self-assessment process and look forward to improving future versions.  We’ll also continue sharing what we are learning, the actions we are taking, as well as grantee perspectives in upcoming blog posts.</p>

<p>Justin Beatty makes visual art in Western Massachusetts based on his worldview as a person of Anishaabe (Ojibwe) and African American heritage. “We’re all related. We’re all relations – the humans, the animals, the trees, the grass, the water, they all encompass what it means to be a being on earth,” he said. “We’re not separate from the spiritual world even though we maybe can’t access it readily. The visual aspects of my art often try to evoke some of that sense of understanding.”

Justin is one of 60 artists to date who have received a working capital grant of $1,000 through the <a href=""https://communityfoundation.org/nonprofits/valleycreates/"">ValleyCreates initiative</a> of the Community Foundation of Western Massachusetts. These funds are accompanied by coaching and workshops delivered in partnership with MASS MoCA’s Assets for Artists. “The workshops teach you about the business of being an artist,” Justin said, citing sessions on licensing, courting businesses that sell art, and marketing, including making better use of his website, as particularly valuable. “Doing business is not what art is about,” he stated. “But it is important for artists to learn to be business people.”</p>

<p>This support for individual artists brings broad benefits. “Launching a grants program that funds artists directly has strengthened our relationships with BIPOC artists across the Valley,” said Vanessa Pabon-Hernandez, a ValleyCreates advisor. “Organic collaborations are forming, and projects are evolving in ways we could not have anticipated.”</p>

<p>Chandrea Grant began dancing and writing poetry as a child after moving with her mother and siblings to New Bedford. Attending a free concert at age 14 sparked the idea of putting her words to music – and set Chan on a life path. “It inspired me to leap into arts,” she said. The concert was hosted by <a href=""https://3rdeyeunlimited.org/"">3rd EyE Youth Empowerment</a>, a nonprofit that engages young people through hip hop and other art forms, helping them grow through creative expression.</p>

Today, Chan writes and performs across the hip hop, R&amp;B, and pop genres. She choreographs and dances with a New Bedford troupe and hosts a collective of three young musicians, helping record and promote their songs. Chan is the driving force in a group of youth advocates who secured grant funding to take 16 local students on a cultural journey to the United Kingdom this summer. Her expansive interests include culinary arts: Chan is opening a food truck business based on a string of successes with pop-up food booths.</p>

<p>Chan’s lengthy relationship with 3rd EyE Youth Empowerment is woven into these endeavors. “The journey of life is lonely and can lead to depression and anxiety,” said Chan. “They have taught me the value of togetherness. And they helped me see that I don’t have to narrow my choices – I can be a musician and entrepreneur and still dance. They guided me in understanding I can put my mind to whatever I want to do.”</p>

<p>The 3rd EyE approach is to meet young people where they are, tying into the creative interests that intrigue them as a starting point for self-awareness, confidence, and empowerment. “We help them gain a perspective on limitations they perceive, and open their minds to new concepts,” said Peter Lonelle Walker, Program Director for 3rd EyE Youth Empowerment. “We know that young people can use their creative skills and interests to create a life for themselves, and to have an impact on others.”</p>

<p>SouthCoast Community Foundation supports 3rd EyE and other partners that champion BIPOC arts and culture through its “Building Blocks” program. The program combines grants, workshops, and expert assistance to help organizations across New Bedford and Fall River grow their abilities in strategic planning, fundraising, and financial management.</p>

<p>Our community foundations support BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) artists in ways illustrated through these examples. We recognize that, for too long, the talents and aspirations of BIPOC artists and their communities have not been a priority for philanthropy. Representation within established arts and culture institutions has been limited as well.</p>

<p>In fact, a sizable number of Massachusetts residents believe systemic racism is present in arts and culture organizations. A 2021 survey by Slover Linett Audience Research shows that, for example, 47% of all residents think systemic racism is present in history museums, and 42% think it exists in art museums. And these percentages increase substantially, to 83% and 78%, respectively, for residents who identify as Black or African American.</p>

<p>At a time when racism and inequity tear at the fabric of communities, BIPOC artists and the often-small organizations that support them are pursuing ways to elevate their work, expand their networks, and engage new audiences. Local donors, foundations, public agencies, and businesses can make a big difference by funding their efforts. These investments yield greater access to the arts and cultural expression of BIPOC communities – and help ensure that all voices are part of conversations that shape the trajectory of Massachusetts cities and towns.</p>

<p>Realizing a more equitable future, with places where everyone thrives, depends on bringing forward the hopes, creativity, and resiliency inherent in all population groups that call Massachusetts home. In this light, individual artists from diverse cultures are vital to the well-being of all Commonwealth communities. Their brilliance propels social, economic, and physical progress in the places we love.</p>

<p>In July, President Biden arrived in Somerset to tour the former Brayton Point power plant and bring attention to our state’s emerging wind energy sector. <a href=""https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-boston-d694ba0c-9e1b-4d04-816c-7b9e3dd1d5e6.html?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslocal_boston&stream=top"">President Biden’s</a> visit underscores the critical role Massachusetts will play in this industry for decades to come.</p>

<p>As our state ramps up to harness the <a href=""https://files.masscec.com/2018%20MassCEC%20Workforce%20Study.pdf"">highest</a> offshore wind capacity in the contiguous U.S., and takes advantage of the White House’s recently-<a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/23/fact-sheet-biden-administration-launches-new-federal-state-offshore-wind-partnership-to-grow-american-made-clean-energy/"">announced</a> Federal-State Offshore Wind Partnership, we must ensure that Massachusetts develops a diverse, equitable, and inclusive offshore wind industry.</p>

<p>As leaders of two organizations that fund and support Black, Latino, Indigenous, and other communities abandoned by our current economic system—<a href=""https://www.newcommonwealthfund.org/"">New Commonwealth Racial Equity and Social Justice Fund (NCF)</a> and the <a href=""https://bostonimpact.org/"">Boston Impact Initiative Fund (BII)</a> — we are uniquely aware of the necessity to implement structural changes and develop solutions that address systemic disparities that harm Black and Brown communities.</p>

<p>That is why, we applaud the State Legislature in their incorporation of inclusive language into its clean energy legislative package (H.4544 and S.2842). <a href=""https://www.utilitydive.com/news/massachusetts-passes-landmark-climate-bill-to-decarbonize-multiple-sector/627916/"">The bills passed</a> include a clean energy equity workforce program that will provide educational and professional development, workforce diversity requirements, jobs for Black and Brown communities in the clean energy industry, start-up opportunities, and grants to certified minority-owned businesses and women-owned businesses.</p>

<p>There’s no denying the reality that clean energy opportunities – including those directly resulting from this legislation – can be a gamechanger for closing the racial wealth gap in Massachusetts. Workers and companies engaged in offshore wind in its early stages – including at the <a href=""https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-approves-first-major-offshore-wind-project-us-waters"">Vineyard Wind</a> project, America’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm – will be getting in at the ground floor of what could turn into a $100 billion industry and <a href=""https://files.masscec.com/2018%20MassCEC%20Workforce%20Study.pdf"">power</a> thousands of jobs. By 2050, offshore wind will become our state’s <a href=""https://www.mass.gov/service-details/offshore-wind-study"">dominant</a> source of clean energy.</p>

<p>It is imperative that as we develop offshore wind, Massachusetts designs policies and processes — from training programs to turbine supply chains — with racial justice in mind.</p>

<p>We recently joined a group of Massachusetts business leaders on a week-long trip to Denmark to gain insight into the nation’s green economy. We learned how the small Nordic country — with a population around the same size as that of Massachusetts — built a stable, climate-friendly energy economy. Today, <a href=""https://stateofgreen.com/en/about/denmarks-green-transition/"">40%</a> of Danish energy comes from wind. The country has created more than <a href=""https://stateofgreen.com/en/about/denmarks-green-transition/"">75,000 green jobs</a> and is on pace to meet its net zero climate goals before 2050. A remarkable <a href=""https://www.osti.gov/biblio/827946"">80%</a> of Denmark’s wind turbines are owned by individuals or cooperatives as opposed to commercially.</p>

<p>Massachusetts can learn three lessons from Middlegrunden and Denmark’s communal ownership structures and workforce development programs. First, the equity of outcomes depends on the equity of the processes that generate them. When developers impose a vision for a project from the top down, they generate top-down gains. When community members are able to articulate their insights, have a say in the solutions, and share in the eventual profits, everyone benefits from the long-term wealth generated by renewable energy infrastructure.</p>

<p>Second, communal ownership requires political support — it isn’t spontaneous. In Denmark, there are <a href=""https://www.resilience.org/stories/2019-07-16/rebel-cities-these-community-wind-farms-in-denmark-and-scotland-are-decentralising-power-to-the-people/"">tax incentives</a> to buy into cooperative wind farms to jolt individual investment. A <a href=""https://www.resilience.org/stories/2019-07-16/rebel-cities-these-community-wind-farms-in-denmark-and-scotland-are-decentralising-power-to-the-people/"">2011 law</a> requires new wind farms to have at least 20% community ownership, so that no project can proceed without public participation. As we develop our own offshore wind industry, Massachusetts should adopt similar incentives and requirements for community ownership and voice, with an intentional focus on ensuring the participation of Black, Brown and Indigenous communities. </p>

<p>Third, our commitment to community benefits must also extend to workforce development. Massachusetts must also cultivate diverse, statewide, human infrastructure. Offshore wind development requires <a href=""https://files-cdn.masscec.com/reports/MassCEC%20OSW%20Workforce%20Final%20Report_Sept%202021.pdf"">119 distinct occupations</a>. Vineyard Wind alone will <a href=""https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-approves-first-major-offshore-wind-project-us-waters"">create</a> 3,600 well-paying union jobs.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Massachusetts <a href=""https://files-cdn.masscec.com/reports/MassCEC%20OSW%20Workforce%20Final%20Report_Sept%202021.pdf"">has an advanced</a> vocational technical high school system. Our state universities are a leading pipeline of engineers and professionals into offshore wind. But we need to expand and increase investments in these programs, and prioritize the recruitment of people of color, women, and those in low-income communities throughout the Commonwealth for new jobs.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -turbines -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> </div> <div class=""Media-caption""> <p>in</p> </div> </div></p>

<p>Danish public and private sector leaders also stressed to us the role of long-term policymaking built on <a href=""https://stateofgreen.com/en/about/denmarks-green-transition/"">political consensus</a> in facilitating their renewable energy revolution. While our climate and energy policies remain splintered along partisan lines, the Biden-Harris Administration is a potent partner for offshore wind development, and we should take full advantage of their commitments to forwarding the industry.</p>

<p>And no matter what happens federally, Massachusetts can continue to drive climate leadership from within by championing pro-climate policymakers and legislation, while also working with neighboring states.</p>

<p>As Massachusetts accelerates its offshore wind development, we must work collaboratively to use our resources, connections, and expertise to bring forward an equitably developed and distributed clean energy economy. This includes creating meaningful incentives and regulations to make community ownership accessible, participation and recruitment of diverse communities, support of minority owned start-ups and innovators, and accountability for developers to see these through.</p>

922,Massachusetts Voters Want More Clean Energy: Insights from our 2022 Poll,<p>Kathryn Wright shares key findings from new polling of Massachusetts voters' attitudes on the future of clean energy.</p>,"<ul>
<li><p>For the past three years, the Barr Clean Energy program has polled voters in New England about their opinions on climate change and the clean energy transition in <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/connecticut-voters-are-ready-for-bold-action-on-climate-and-clean-energy"">2021</a> and <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/six-things-massachusetts-voters-are-saying-about-clean-energy"">2020</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>In May 2022, over 600 registered Massachusetts voters participated in a new survey, conducted by <a href=""https://globalstrategygroup.com/about/"">Global Strategies Group</a>. This survey showed Massachusetts voters are optimistic about renewable energy and continue to be concerned about climate change.</p></li>
<li><p>In alignment with voters&#39; views, Massachusetts, policymakers have begun to respond, as evidenced by last year’s <a href=""https://malegislature.gov/Laws/SessionLaws/Acts/2021/Chapter8"">landmark climate legislation</a> and the July 2022 <a href=""https://www.wbur.org/news/2022/07/22/massachusetts-climate-bill-baker-desk"">Act Driving Clean Energy and Offshore Wind</a>, which the Governor recently signed.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The purpose of the 2022 Clean Energy Survey</strong> was to understand how voter attitudes have evolved towards climate change, clean energy, and the transition away from natural gas. The survey also tested the persuasiveness of different messaging.</p>

<p>There are several trends, which have persisted from our previous polling:</p>

<ul>
<li>Consistent with our findings from previous polls, <strong>Massachusetts voters remain concerned about climate change.</strong> Since the 2020 poll, there was a 5% decrease in the number of voters who were unsure if climate change was a problem or thought it was not a problem, signaling an increase in awareness.</li>
<li><strong>Support for renewable energy has continued to grow.</strong> Since our 2020 poll, the percentage of voters who want to see more solar and wind in the energy mix has increased from 88% for solar and 85% for wind to 92% for solar and 86% for wind. Wind and solar are by far the most popular choice for new electricity sources. Voters were considerably more mixed about using additional natural gas or nuclear energy and a greater percentage expressed interest in using less coal and oil. </li>
<li>As we observed in our 2021 <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/connecticut-voters-are-ready-for-bold-action-on-climate-and-clean-energy"">Connecticut poll</a>, <strong>Massachusetts voters of color also support the renewable energy transition at a higher rate than the general population.</strong> While the majority of voters believe clean energy will protect their communities from climate change, voters of color also believe there will be positive economic impacts from the clean energy transition. These findings reemphasize the importance of centering communities of color and their perspectives in regional energy transition dialogues and policymaking. </li>
</ul>

<p>For our 2022 poll, we added questions to understand voter awareness regarding the key institutions impacting the clean energy transition and tested voters’ perceptions around some of the Commonwealth’s recent climate goals and commitments.</p>
<h3>2022 Poll Findings:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>There is widespread support and optimism for Massachusetts’ transition to renewable energy.</strong> Two thirds of voters called a transition to renewable energy realistic, a major shift from the 2020 poll. There was also broad support for policies which would require further energy efficiency and incentivize the transition away from fossil fuels in buildings.</li>
<li><strong>Voter sentiment on natural gas is evolving.</strong> Since 2020, there has been a decrease in voters who think natural gas is safe for home heating or cooking. Voters are also very divided on using more natural gas in the electricity mix with 54% of voters wanting less natural gas and 46% wanting more. Recent science has demonstrated the negative health impacts of natural gas on indoor and outdoor air quality, which may be influencing these trends. </li>
<li>The survey finds an <strong>overwhelming lack of awareness from all voters about ISO-New England</strong>, which operates our regional electric grid and plays a large role in the speed of the clean energy transition. Very few voters could identify ISO-New England and even fewer could directly identify its role in the region’s clean energy transition. </li>
</ul>

<p>We took a deeper dive into the numbers, and pulled out <strong>five key data points that can inform the strategies of clean energy advocates</strong> to increase awareness and articulate next steps for Massachusetts going forward:</p>

<ol>
<li>85% of voters say climate change is a problem, with 25% of voters calling it a crisis and 37% of voters calling it a very serious problem.

921,Green Power at Lower Cost: Green Municipal Aggregation in Massachusetts,<p>Green Energy Consumers Alliance shares findings and opportunities for growth from a new report on green municipal aggregation in Massachusetts.</p>,"<p><em>As Massachusetts seeks to accelerate its clean energy transition, more communities have begun to pursue green municipal aggregation (GMA)  – also known as community choice aggregation or community choice electricity. GMA allows Massachusetts and cities and towns to request bids from electricity suppliers to meet their community’s energy needs. In Massachusetts, GMAs have emphasized securing cleaner energy than is provided by basic utility service.</em></p>

<p><em>Barr’s Climate program has long supported educational efforts led by community advocates across the region to support GMA implementation. We view these aggregations as a critical strategy to increase energy affordability, protect consumers from <a href=""https://www.mass.gov/news/new-ag-report-massachusetts-residents-lost-426-million-through-competitive-electric-supply-contracts-in-last-five-years"">predatory retail electricity providers</a> and drive towards the Commonwealth’s decarbonization goals. In Boston, all customers, from those receiving default service to those opting-in to the 100% renewable energy tier, are receiving electricity at less than the Eversource basic service rate.This program saves residents money in one of the <a href=""https://www.equitymap.org/boston-energy-burden-impacts"">most energy burdened cities</a> in the country. Many more communities are still waiting for their GMAs to be approved by the Department of Public Utilities so that they can access the public health, climate, and cost saving benefits of the program. It is our hope that these approvals can be accelerated ahead of the winter season so that more Massachusetts residents can benefit from the impact of renewable energy.</em></p>

<p><em>Green Energy Consumers Alliance (GECA) has served as a long-time partner and leader for GMAs. GECA recently released a new report analyzing the collective impact of green aggregation programs on emissions reductions and cost savings for ratepayers in Massachusetts.</em> </p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>GECA is excited to present our new report on the great benefits brought to the Commonwealth through Green Municipal Aggregation (GMA) programs. Our report includes data on over 200 communities, and we show how there are opportunities to build upon a great record of success to achieve even more if state government provides the support aggregation deserves.</p>

<p>Municipal aggregation is the process by which a town or city purchases electricity in bulk from a competitive supplier on behalf of the residents and businesses within the community. The fundamental characteristic distinguishing GMA from traditional aggregations is that the default electricity supply in a GMA includes more Class I renewable content than required by the Massachusetts Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). Class I renewable energy is wind, solar, anaerobic digestion, and low-impact hydro, as <a href=""https://www.mass.gov/service-details/program-summaries"">defined here</a> by the Commonwealth. </p>

<p>Aggregation impacts the supply portion of energy bills. This report compares the renewable energy content and pricing of supply offered by aggregations to that of Basic Service products offered by utilities and products offered by competitive suppliers.  With an aggregation, electricity is still delivered or distributed by the local utility and rates for distribution are regulated by the Department of Public Utilities.</p>

<p>Green Energy Consumers Alliance serves several GMAs by supplying them with renewable energy over and above the amount required to meet the state mandates: Arlington, Bedford, Brookline, Dedham, Fairhaven, Gloucester, Hamilton, Medford, Melrose, Millis, Milton, Rockland, Somerville, Stoneham, Waltham, Westford, and Winchester. Green Energy Consumers Alliance also supplies additional renewable energy for consumers in these communities who opt-up to 50%, 65%, or 100% renewable energy content.</p>
<h3>Findings</h3>
<p>Our report is based upon Green Energy Consumers’ direct experience as well as our analysis of similar programs throughout Massachusetts.  Here are the key facts:</p>

<ul>
<li>215 cities and towns have an approved aggregation plan, have participated in aggregation in the past, or are currently researching aggregation or waiting to be approved by the Department of Public Utilities.  This color-coded map shows which communities have aggregations and how much they are adding in terms of Class I renewable energy. </li>
</ul>

<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/4126/small.jpg?1659470411 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/4126/medium.jpg?1659470411 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/4126/large.jpg?1659470411 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/4126/x_large.jpg?1659470411 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""GECA GMA map"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/4126/small.jpg?1659470411"" /> </div> </div></p>

<ul>
<li>Of that total, 50 communities have, “dark green” programs with a default electricity supply product with 5 percent or more Class I renewable content than required by the RPS.<br></li>
<li>Over 20 more are “light green” with some extra renewable energy content but less than 5 percent.<br></li>
<li>Over 40 communities don’t have a default product with Class I renewable content but offer an opt-up option. </li>
<li>Altogether, these programs are increasing demand for renewable energy by one million megawatt-hours per year beyond state requirements. That’s the equivalent of about 300 large wind turbines. These programs are achieving success without public subsidy. </li>
<li>We analyzed data on the 38 communities with default products that include between 5 and 11 percent Class I renewable energy beyond the RPS (which is 24% in 2022).  Ratepayers enrolled in those products saved an average of 1.3 cents per kilowatt-hour compared to the Basic Service energy supply offered by Eversource or National Grid.  For an average consumer using 6000 kilowatt-hours per year, the annual savings would be <strong>$78 per household.</strong> That’s significant savings for programs offering significantly more green power than the investor-owned utilities. </li>
</ul>

<p>If every family throughout the Commonwealth enrolled in such an aggregation program, with 5-11% extra green power, the savings would amount to over $200 million per year and the additional renewable energy would amount to 1.6 million megawatt-hours. It is important to note, however, that savings for GMA compared to utility Basic Service are not guaranteed. However, our analysis of the empirical data shows that recent history has been in favor of aggregation. We have observed that GMA is not always less expensive than Basic Service, but in the case of three-year contracts, which include six 6-month cycles of Basic Service pricing, GMA is less expensive most of the time. </p>

<h3>Relevance</h3>
<p>Green Municipal Aggregation is solid evidence that we can speed up the transition to green power affordably. The climate deniers who insist that fossil fuels are always better for the consumer are wrong.</p>

<p>With GMA, consumers can opt-out, if they choose not to participate, at any time without penalty or, in many cases, stay with the aggregation and “opt-down” to a product that isn’t greener than state law requires and that costs the least. </p>

<p>This report documents that bill savings are possible for people in aggregations compared to Basic Service, with the potential for even larger savings compared to products offered by competitive power suppliers working outside of aggregation programs.  The Attorney General’s office has produced <a href=""https://www.mass.gov/news/new-ag-report-massachusetts-residents-lost-426-million-through-competitive-electric-supply-contracts-in-last-five-years"">three reports</a> demonstrating that competitive power suppliers generally over-charge customers, especially customers who are low-income and people of color.</p>

<p>Despite all these measures of success, the Mass. Department of Public Utilities has been incredibly slow to approve plans proposed by new communities and even minor amendments proposed by existing aggregations. As H. Jackson Brown wrote, nothing is more expensive than a missed opportunity.</p>

920,New Funding Extends Transformation Efforts in Five High Schools ,<p>Beyond Engage New England is a $2.85 million investment in five schools committed to ensuring post-secondary success for all students.</p>,"<p>I am excited to announce new Barr Foundation grants totaling $2.85 million over three years to New England schools and school districts committed to doing high school differently. These awards mark the launch of a new initiative, called Beyond Engage New England (Beyond ENE) that extends work that began in 2016 with Barr’s <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/education/engage-new-england"">Engage New England</a> initiative. Beyond ENE will continue to ensure that all young people in New England - but especially the students who have often been most failed by our system and for whom people often have the lowest expectations - thrive in high school and are on a trajectory for lives of choice and opportunity.</p>

<p>Engage New England provided financial support and technical assistance for teams of educators to develop high school models that champion success for all students. Schools and programs also participated in a learning collaborative to share lessons with each other and like-minded peers from across the country.</p>

<p>Now, with Beyond ENE, five schools that went through rigorous planning and implementation of their school models have committed to press further with ongoing iteration to reach excellence and to continue sharing their learning. The selected Beyond ENE schools share our belief that all students can and must be prepared for success in college, regardless of their race, personal characteristics, or academic background. We know that not every student will choose to pursue a college degree immediately after high school graduation. But, we are supporting our partners to ensure that all students are prepared for that opportunity, and graduate with an explicit plan for true post-secondary success.</p>

<p>Barr will continue to partner with the national school design organization, <a href=""https://www.springpointschools.org/"">Springpoint</a> to support Beyond ENE schools to <strong>deepen and enhance</strong> the most promising and impactful work from the Engage New England initiative, <strong>embed and sustain change</strong> with strong systems and plans for succession and sustainability, and <strong>expand impact</strong> by documenting and sharing what is possible for students who have fallen off-track to graduation so that other schools and systems can replicate effective practices. Springpoint supports will focus on five key areas, which are aligned with common areas of growth in the <a href=""https://barrfdn.issuelab.org/resource/indicators-of-school-quality.html"">Indicators of School Quality</a> framework:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Prioritized competencies</em> that clearly articulate the most essential skills students will need to be successful in college, career, and life</li>
<li><em>Transformative learning experiences</em> – robust project-based learning units – that can help students develop identity, pursue interests, find purpose, and build fundamental mastery of skills, especially those articulated in the prioritized competencies</li>
<li>A <em>primary person model</em> explicitly focused on ensuring every student is known well and has a relationship with an adult charged with supporting their success and pathway to graduation</li>
<li><em>External partnerships</em>, including implementing a school-based coordinator role, so that student learning experiences and supports fully come to life for students</li>
<li><em>Post-secondary planning</em> to build intentional structures for college and career planning to ensure that all students have informed, individualized, rigorous, and realistic post-secondary plans</li>
</ul>

<p><div class=""Media - -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> </div> </div></p>

<p>The five partners in this new initiative include three public school districts in Massachusetts, a regional education council in Connecticut, and one public charter school in Rhode Island:</p>

</ul>

<p>New England’s schools have done a good job for many students. Yet, too many still leave high school early or graduate unprepared for what’s next. The current system is not working for them. This is why Barr supports a wide range of public schools across New England that believe in the potential of all students and are working hard to make deep and lasting change.</p>

<p>The five Beyond ENE partners have made impressive progress creating high schools where all young people can thrive and build lives of choice and opportunity. We are excited to support their continuing work and to share what they learn along the way.</p>

916,Growth and Opportunity: Education Team Updates,<p>Exciting additions and transitions within Barr’s Education Program Team. </p>,"<p>School transformation takes vision and persistence. Vision and persistence take leadership. For us at Barr, that means having an Education team with a deep understanding of the work of schools and systems, the commitment to center students in all of our work, and the ability to build strong and trusting relationships with our partners. Just as bold leadership is a critical factor for school change, highly knowledgeable and skilled program leadership is essential to effective school partnerships for Barr.</p>

<p>I am pleased to announce two new colleagues joining Barr’s Education team, who bring extensive school and system experience, as well as exciting new opportunities for our current Education team leaders. </p>
<h3>Expanding Team Expertise</h3>
<p>Our Education strategy includes three strategic levers: <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/catalyze-new-models"">Catalyze New Models</a>, which focuses on transforming the high school experience to put success within reach of all students across New England; <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/invest-in-educators"">Invest in Educators</a>, which seeks to increase teacher and leader capacity to support and sustain that kind of transformation; and <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/build-public-will"">Build Public Will</a>, which seeks to engage and support advocates for transformational change. We are excited to bring on board two Senior Program Officers to advance and accelerate our work on two of those strategies.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. John Travis</strong> will be joining us as the new Senior Program Officer for the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/invest-in-educators"">Invest in Educators</a> portfolio. Most recently, John has been a school principal in Boston Public Schools, leading his community through a number of school improvement initiatives and, for the past two years, the challenges presented by the pandemic. He will also bring his experience as a high school and middle school math teacher and former Director of Human Capital for Boston Public Schools to lead grantmaking strategies in support of teacher and school leader development. John’s first day will be September 1. 
<div class=""Media - -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> </div> </div>
<strong>Dr. Patrick Tutwiler</strong> will join the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/catalyze-new-models"">Catalyze New Models</a> strategy team in a new Senior Program Officer position focused on elevating system-level impact. Over the course of a more than twenty-year career in education, Pat has applied his student-centered philosophy while leading classrooms, as a high school history teacher, schools, and school systems in Massachusetts. Pat is currently the Superintendent of Lynn Public Schools, the fifth largest school district in the state. He will officially join the Barr team on August 29.

<h3>Education Team Leadership Transitions</h3>
<p>Seven years ago, Leah Hamilton joined Barr as Director of Education, immediately embarking on an in-depth review of Barr’s education strategy, engaging in extensive conversations with grantees and other stakeholders, and gathering a comprehensive fact-base to inform our current strategy launched in 2016. Since that time, the Education Team has invested boldly in pioneering efforts across the region, built extensive partnerships, crafted focused evaluation and outcome measurement efforts, and continuously tested and evolved its thinking and approaches – always centered on students. <strong>Leah has now accepted an offer to take on an exciting new leadership role as Vice President of Philanthropy for Barr’s affiliated family office, Pilot House Associates</strong>. She will work alongside Barr’s co-founders, Barbara and Amos Hostetter, as they continue to advance their philanthropy. Leah has adeptly led the Program through a major period of growth and development, and we will miss her leadership and thoughtfulness – but are so glad to know she’ll remain in the building as a family office colleague. Leah will be available to support Barr’s work as needed through this transition period.</p>

<p>In turn, I’m very happy to report that <strong><a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/jenny-curtin?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Barr%20Education%20Team%20Update&utm_content=Barr%20Education%20Team%20Update+CID_3bceffab695ac3a86ad96e677e0405ed&utm_source=cm_email&utm_term=Jenny%20Curtin"">Jenny Curtin</a> will assume leadership of the Education Program as Acting Director, effective July 1st</strong>. Jenny joined Barr in 2016 from the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. Since that time, she has led the development and growth of Barr’s <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/catalyze-new-models?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Barr%20Education%20Team%20Update&utm_content=Barr%20Education%20Team%20Update+CID_3bceffab695ac3a86ad96e677e0405ed&utm_source=cm_email&utm_term=Catalyze%20New%20Models"">Catalyze New Models</a> strategy. Jenny is a trusted partner to education leaders across New England. She has provided invaluable, steadfast, and strategic partnership to Barr colleagues and our grantees and I am looking forward to working with her as she continues to move the Education Program forward into new opportunities.</p>

<p>We are proud to support more than 150 partners across New England in the work of creating more equitable experiences and outcomes for high school students. We at Barr are grateful for their partnership and I’m personally grateful for the expertise, talents, and commitment of Barr’s Education team. We remain focused on supporting our partners and continuing the forward momentum of our collective work to design high-quality schools that all students deserve.</p>"
913,Closing the Racial Wealth Gap,<p>Jim Canales describes Barr’s initial grantmaking focused on racial wealth equity in Greater Boston.</p>,"<p>A few years ago, I wrote about the Barr Foundation’s <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/an-enduring-commitment-to-racial-equity"">enduring commitment to racial equity</a>. Since that time, we have outlined various ways in which this commitment has been made manifest in our priorities and our grantmaking (examples include the efforts in our <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/racial-equity-and-barr-s-arts-creativity-program"">Arts</a> and <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/racial-equity-and-barr-s-climate-program"">Climate</a> programs as well as our <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/investing-in-leadership-for-racial-equity"">leadership investments</a>). Our focus to date has been on expanding and deepening Barr’s commitment to racial equity within our core programs and existing initiatives.</p>

<p>Last year, in conversation with <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/about#trustees"">our trustees</a> about our work, we found ourselves frequently returning to a central truth: addressing the persistent racial wealth gap is perhaps one of the most important levers to advancing racial equity.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--persistent""> <p>the</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>What would it look like to achieve racial wealth equity in our region? To start, it would mean that an individual’s racial or ethnic identity does not predict or restrict their capacity to deal with financial adversity, care for themselves and their family, or take advantage of economic opportunities, including home ownership, business ownership, and asset accumulation. There are many reasons for the existing racial wealth gap, but at its heart, we cannot ignore the role that systemic racism and our history of exclusionist legal and social policies have contributed to this reality.</p>
<h3>Listening and Learning</h3>
<p>Realizing that no single entity can tackle this complicated issue, we sought to explore over the past several months if there was a constructive role for Barr in addressing this imperative, with a focus on the Greater Boston region. In this exploration, we listened. We listened to and centered the voices and perspectives of those who have been working on addressing the racial wealth gap to learn from their experiences and to benefit from their advice to us.</p>

<p>These discussions were insightful, productive, and—importantly—candid, especially in their guidance to Barr. We not only learned more about the substance of the issue and the range of solutions underway, but we learned how we should engage. And much of what we were told echoes themes we have heard across the foundation: the value of investing significant and unrestricted resources, especially in organizations serving and led by people of color; the imperative to trust our partners and to behave as co-learners in this work; and the value of using Barr’s voice and platform to amplify issues and solutions and to bring new allies to the table.</p>

<p>Based on this, we resisted the natural impulse in philanthropy to take a great deal of time to shape a perfected strategy. Instead, we have already started to move resources to organizations that have proven commitment and understanding in advancing racial wealth equity in Greater Boston.</p>
<h3>Grantmaking to Date</h3>
<p>Over the course of 2022, we will invest a total of $15-20 million to support a cohort of allied organizations who are eager to learn from each other and who can help us to shape Barr’s strategy going forward. As a starting point, our grants will focus in three areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Supporting leaders and organizations advancing racial wealth equity in the Greater Boston region</li>
<li>Deepening and broadening research and evidence about the nature of the racial wealth gap and prospective solutions</li>
<li>Exploring the role of narrative efforts to expand understanding of multiple perspectives and support space for community dialogue</li>
</ul>
<h4>To date, Barr has awarded over $9 million in grants to the following organizations:</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://www.bfit.edu/"">Benjamin Franklin Cummings Institute of Technology</a> ($1,000,000)</li>
<li><a href=""https://www.becma.org/"">Black Economic Council of Massachusetts</a> ($1,500,000)</li>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>In 2023, we will share more detail on Barr’s plans, including the scale and scope of this special initiative focused on advancing racial wealth equity in Greater Boston. We invite anyone interested in learning more to <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/special-initiatives/preview/e8c9f5d3-1848-4eb6-a192-9cf8f7f1ecea#our-approach"">sign up for updates</a> about this evolving initiative.</p>

<p>A key element in Barr’s work going forward will be to hire a dedicated staff leader for this initiative, someone who will work in partnership with our grantees and others to give further shape to this collective work. We will be taking next steps on that new role soon.</p>

<p>As we enter this space, we bring the clear understanding that addressing the racial wealth gap will require concerted effort across many sectors as well as a willingness to tackle the policies and practices, rooted in systemic racism and oppression, that have contributed to our reality.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--racial""> <p>the</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>We also bring the humility that philanthropy’s role in this work is but a small part, but we approach the work with optimism that by working in close partnership with others, by being willing to learn and iterate with those partners, and by building a larger coalition toward collective action, we can together make a difference.</p>

<p>Our continued quest for an equitable society demands this work, and our future generations deserve nothing less.</p>

912,"To Center Equity, We Must Learn Differently ",<p>Three practice shifts in how we learn alongside our grantee partners.</p>,"<p>Effective philanthropy is fundamentally about learning. We want to learn how systems work, about barriers faced by communities seeking change, and how our resources might be best put to use in support of those changes. But we are increasingly mindful that the process of learning, while well-intentioned, has at times been at odds with our values and may need to be redesigned to advance our equity goals. As Barr’s President <a href=""https://www.2022barrfoundation.org/?utm_source=Barr+Home&utm_medium=website&utm_id=YIR22&_ga=2.151365055.762952783.1648582047-1751403927.1637351512#black-sections"">Jim Canales recently noted</a>, “To confront structural racism, massive wealth inequality, power imbalances, and other obstacles to the equitable world we aspire to, we must understand our role, as a philanthropic institution, in how we got here.” We wanted to share a few concrete ways we are reimagining our learning practices to better align with our commitment to building trusting relationships with our grantees and centering racial equity in our work.</p>
<h3>Learning together in real time.</h3>
<p>Urgent needs, frequently changing context, and a commitment to advance equity have all increased the importance of timely and collaborative learning. This collaboration must include shaping our learning priorities and questions as well as who we listen to. Equity requires us to center the experiences of those most impacted and least heard, and to share these experiences broadly, hopeful that elevating their voices can shape a different future. Examples included surveys of Massachusetts high school students on <a href=""https://barrfdn.issuelab.org/resource/distance-and-disruption-listening-to-massachusetts-students-during-covid-19.html"">COVID learning disruptions</a>; understanding the work of grassroots community-led groups <a href=""https://barrfdn.issuelab.org/resource/opportunities-to-invest-in-community-resilience-for-covid-and-climate.html"">building resilience in Boston, Chelsea, and Revere</a>; and learning from leaders of <a href=""https://tdcorp.org/2020/12/arts-creativity-field-scan/"">artistic and creative organizations forging new relationships to audiences and communities</a> in light of prolonged closures and a racial justice reckoning. </p>
<h3>Shorter cycles, lighter lifts, and purpose-driven learning.</h3>
<p>Navigating the uncertainty and disruption of the past two years pushed us to scrutinize our data collection and reporting practices. Final reports delivered at the end of a grant have never been an ideal philanthropic learning practice, but this format of reflection was entirely inadequate during the pandemic given the need to adapt and rethink with our grantees in real time. In terms of evaluation and reporting, we focused our efforts on places where data was essential to inform decision-making toward more equitable outcomes and pushed ourselves to further streamline wherever possible. Like many funders (<a href=""https://cep.org/foundations-respond-to-crisis/"">Foundations Respond to Crisis series, CEP</a>), Barr sought to reduce burden and bureaucracy so grantees could put their time and effort into the work. Program officers found opportunities to replace written reporting requirements with documented conversations and debriefs. For Barr’s Arts &amp; Creativity Team for example, these conversations have served as moments to reflect and take a breath amidst chaos; to strengthen relationships with grantees and combat feelings of isolation; and to listen to grantee needs. Being flexible and employing a variety of approaches for how grantees share their work with us also enabled grantees to lead the way with their expertise, freeing them up to test and adjust new approaches in the face of shifting context and demands. </p>

<h3>Coming together in new ways.</h3>
<p>Convenings are the roads and bridges of the social sector, a standard tool for building relationships, advancing collective work, and supporting field learning. The last two years have forced us to question and rethink this practice as well. The 2020 scramble to shift in-person convenings and conferences to virtual platforms did fill a critical gap and offer an opportunity to connect, but in 2021 our grantees and the social sector at large experienced significant virtual event fatigue. Moving into an uncertain hybrid future, we hope to continue to evolve how and when we come together, holding purpose, value to our partners, accessibility, relationship building, and the benefits of collective learning front and center. A few examples of how our partners have stayed connected and supported cohort and network learning include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Our Education Program’s Catalyze New Models grantees stayed connected through weekly virtual discussion as needed when in rapid response mode as well as via a quarterly newsletter produced by The Learning Agenda and the Barr Education Team to share resources and profile the inspiring transformation work of schools and systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Social platforms such as Mobilize became more popular during the pandemic and were particularly useful for our Arts grantees in initiative-based cohorts to share ideas, track rapid shifts in government funding opportunities, and solve timely problems.</p></li>
<li><p>After community infection rates began to drop last fall, small group outdoor meetups were a welcome chance to reconnect, particularly among executive directors seeking support and community during the crisis (such as among our Barr Fellows).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>A more equitable approach to learning in the sector is long overdue, and we cannot advance equity without uprooting and unlearning harmful practices that impede our equity goals. We also cannot do this work alone. In addition to the work with our grantees outlined above, we are also inspired by thought leaders in the field who envision a different and more equitable role for philanthropic learning, such as the Center for Evaluation Innovation (see “<a href=""https://www.evaluationinnovation.org/publication/toward-a-trust-based-framework-for-learning-and-evaluation/"">What does a more equitable and trust-based approach to learning and evaluation look like?</a>”), and the <a href=""https://www.equitableeval.org/"">Equitable Evaluation Initiative</a>. Our Learning Officer Rory Neuner will share some reflections in an upcoming blog post on Barr’s internal journey to more equitable learning, including our ongoing efforts to embed these ideas in our organization as well as in our region.  </p>"
911,Six Questions with Barr's Mobility Program Officer,"<p>Through an interview with Jules Faña, Barr’s communications coordinator, Najah Casimir, our Mobility Program Officer, discusses what drives their work, lessons from past experiences that they’re applying to their current role, and their priorities at Barr.</p>","<h3>Q1: <span style=""color: #008578;"">What led you to working in mobility?</span></h3>

<p>Nothing matters if you can’t get to it or it can’t get to you. Growing up in Philadelphia, I saw first-hand how transportation was a tool for granting or limiting access to the things people need. History also shows us that from enslavers using ships to import people to planners building highways through communities, restricting or forcing movement has long been a tool for oppression. Creating a world where people can move freely, in ways that don’t cause collective harm, is key to a just society.</p>

<p>One thing I love about working on mobility at Barr is that we’re thinking about both transportation and land use. How can we support a responsive, sustainable transportation network that allows people to efficiently get from point A to point B? How can we help facilitate clustering points together to make it easier for people to get what they need or want without having to travel long distances? Real solutions to our transportation challenges must be holistic and account for all the intersections of people’s lives.</p>

<h3>Q2: Before joining Barr, you were the Communications Manager for the City of Cambridge's Traffic, Parking, and Transportation Department. <br /> <br /><span style=""color: #008578;"">What did you learn from that experience that will shape your work as a program officer?
</span></h3>

<p>Listening is an active form of communication. That’s something I reflected on a lot when I worked at the City of Boston, carried over to the City of Cambridge, and have now brought with me to Barr.</p>

<p>We’re sent a lot of messages that tell us more is more and that the best thing for us to do is keep talking and producing. But these approaches ignore that there are people who have been thinking about solutions longer than I’ve been alive and folks who carry generational knowledge about how we can heal our earth. Listening, and ultimately responding, to what others in the community know is the most efficient way for me to participate in this movement.</p>

<h3>Q3: In <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/fair-transit-fares-for-an-equitable-and-climate-friendly-future"">your first Barr blog post,</a> you reflected on why comprehensive solutions to transit fare policies must shift burdens away from people and onto systems.<br /> <br /><span style=""color: #008578;""> How does this relate to the larger climate movement?</span></h3>

<p>We know that many individual decisions are driven by the choices presented to us. For example, a significant portion of my personal waste is generated by what I eat. I’d love to buy more food with less packaging. But when I go to the grocery store, the only things I can buy that aren’t wrapped excessively are fruits, vegetables, and nuts. With my many food intolerances I’m further limited in my choices. As a result, I’m often toting home 75% food and 25% trash/recycling.</p>

<p>One reason the Mobility Strategy is part of the Climate Program is that we know transportation is a major source of greenhouse-gas emissions in Massachusetts. I have no discretion over the way the goods I buy are produced or transported. Most of the negative impacts on the climate happen before I even take a product off the shelf. The burden lies on the system, and more specifically those who control it, to make sure we reverse course and maintain a livable earth.</p>

<h3>Q4: As part of the Climate Team’s continued work to center racial equity, you led on updating the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/climate#inquiries"">Climate inquiry process</a>. This included making it clear that the Program is focused on building relationships with more equity-centered organizations led by People of Color.<br /> <br /><span style=""color: #008578;"">What other changes do you look forward to implementing and supporting in the Program’s work?</span></h3>

<p>In this moment, where it sometimes feels like everything is on fire, it’s important to move with intention. To me that means being upfront with people and not wasting time on unnecessary processes.</p>

<p>I saw a <a href=""https://nonprofitaf.com/2022/05/subtle-ways-power-dynamics-manifest-between-nonprofits-and-funders/"">recent blog post from Nonprofit AF</a> that started with, “Last week, a colleague told me they wrote a grant proposal that totaled 72 pages, for a $5,000 grant.” I immediately thought to myself, “Nope.” I know it happened, but I also know that’s not the approach I want to take to my work. As a funder, I believe my primary responsibility is to invest in work that contributes to the greater good. Unnecessary paperwork reinforces power dynamics and contributes to the culture of urgency. Rather than stressing to make sure each document is in order and edited to perfection, I’d prefer people spend time on real work, which is outside and in communities, not in the grantee portal or my inbox.</p>

<p>After accounting for the huge burden that lengthy proposal requirements put on people, I also wonder about the environmental impact of storing all these documents. Back in the day (and still some today), signatures included “Save a tree, think before you print this email!” Now we need, “Save a tree, think before you create another large document that contributes to the need for more data centers. Remember, the ‘cloud’ is on the ground.”</p>

<p>I’m glad to have joined the Barr Foundation at a time when there&#39;s a strong emphasis on reworking our systems to better support people who work with us. I am excited to help build on the work that started well before I arrived. Updating the inquiries section of our Climate page was one part of that. I hope it makes it easier for people to introduce themselves to us and that, for people who become our grantees or partners, we carry the spirit of the inquiry form throughout our collaboration.</p>

<h3>Q5: <span style=""color: #008578;"">What intersections do you see between the climate crisis and other issues people are facing?</span></h3>

<p>I think it all goes back to how we live and work. Back when our work was more collective and connected to the earth, we had more freedom and flexibility in how we lived. Now that much, if not most, work globally is related to producing for exponential consumption, things have changed. The earth is responding accordingly.</p>

<p>Before the industrial revolution, many people slept in two chunks rather than one. But, you can get the most out of factory machinery by having the people who operate them work in regimented shifts. So, sleep schedules were altered. The machines need fossil fuels to run. So, we extract continuously no matter the societal cost. As long as so much of our work is organized around increasing profits in perpetuity, there will always be excessive and harmful extraction of resources and a need for a large worker class. It’s not lost on me that as the chosen response to COVID resulted in the death of one million people in the US alone, and as workers continue to win their organizing efforts, we’re also living through an attack on education and reproductive rights. Uteruses are being treated as manufacturing plants for the human bodies that will be pushed toward becoming extensions of the machines.</p>

<p>The system of white supremacy is so complex that at this point it’s also pretty simple. No matter the specific issue, if you want to solve problems in ways that benefit people and our planet, it’s imperative that solutions are defined by the communities who live with the largest negative impacts of oppression. And, since these systems propel themselves by building off each other, if you’re actually addressing the root cause of one, you’re deconstructing others at the same time. That’s why I’m focusing on the larger structure from the intersection of mobility and climate change.</p>

<h3>Q6: <span style=""color: #008578;"">Looking forward, what’s the most important thing you hope to achieve during your time at Barr? What is your primary focus?</span> </h3>

<p>Ensuring our work is rooted in supporting and building community power. And, encouraging others to do the same. It’s the only way out of these crises.</p>"
909,"How School Leaders Prioritize Equity, Achievement, and Wellness - Even in Challenging Times","<p>While the last two years have been challenging for all, some leaders have redoubled their focus on equity, achievement, and wellness in their classrooms. In a new series, Relay follows exceptional leaders from across the country to document and share their effective leadership strategies.</p>","<p>As part of our work with school and system leaders across the nation, Relay Graduate School of Education has <a href=""https://medium.com/relay-gse-follow-the-leaders"">followed nearly a dozen exceptional leaders</a> as they aim to create schools where children and adults thrive, not simply survive. While the pandemic has created challenges for all, these leaders typify the mindset of adaptive leaders committed to meeting the changing needs of their schools. As TS Hoard, principal of the Excellence Boys Charter Middle School in Brooklyn, New York, emphatically stated last fall, “<a href=""https://medium.com/relay-gse-follow-the-leaders/transforming-teaching-and-learning-through-modeling-and-practice-73270e223bef"">This will not be a lost year</a>.”</p>

<p>Effective leaders have always had this mindset. But during a challenging and unpredictable time, these leaders led their schools through a process of addition by subtraction: in other words, by honing their vision, narrowing their priorities, and focusing their time on three pillars: equity, achievement, and wellness.</p>

<p><strong>Equity</strong>. As the pandemic has exacerbated the challenges faced by young people from historically marginalized populations, these leaders are focused on ensuring their students have access to and support reaching grade level expectations every day.  Rather than lower these expectations, <a href=""https://medium.com/relay-gse-follow-the-leaders/supporting-high-expectations-for-student-learning-no-matter-what-b17af42ae37a"">Dr. Brandi Chin</a>, founding school director of DSST Middle School at Noel Campus in Denver, stepped up efforts to teach students the habits of rigorous learning, like analysis, conceptual understanding, and application of skills to real world problems. “This is how we fight the good fight: By engaging students in critical thinking, so they can access positions of power and make changes in our country,” she says.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full""> <div class=""u-fluid-iframe""> <div class=""u-fluid-iframe-inner""> <iframe src=""//player.vimeo.com/video/548876981?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0"" title=""Featured Video"" frameborder=""0"" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen loading=""lazy""> <a href=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/548876981?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0"">A video on Vimeo</a> </iframe> </div> </div> </div></p>

<p><strong>Achievement</strong>. For the leaders we followed, putting that vision into practice involves doubling down on the classroom—by engaging students with <a href=""https://medium.com/relay-gse-follow-the-leaders/transforming-teaching-and-learning-through-modeling-and-practice-73270e223bef"">rigorous, discourse-driven lessons</a> and <a href=""https://medium.com/relay-gse-follow-the-leaders/they-know-to-find-me-in-classrooms-how-one-principal-develops-a-culture-of-real-time-feedback-b9326ef24341"">providing teachers with feedback and support in the moment</a> to ensure that they maximize student learning, even as their schools face an overwhelming array of pandemic-related challenges. In Denver Public Schools, regional instructional superintendent Heather Haines  <a href=""https://medium.com/relay-gse-follow-the-leaders/narrowing-the-focus-honing-a-plan-to-close-equity-gaps-in-instruction-38c45d1f555a"">simplified the “playbook”</a> by narrowing priorities for teachers and staff at all levels to ensure that all students—including those from historically marginalized populations—were engaged in grade-level, curriculum-based tasks at least 90 percent of the time. </p>

<p><strong>Wellness</strong>. These leaders understand that being ready to learn means feeling safe—that students feel like they’re understood, listened to, and cared for, particularly given the ongoing challenges and accumulated trauma of the past two years. At Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Early College in Denver, Principal Kimberly Grayson shared a video of students discussing the impact of the pandemic and remote learning to help staff better understand what students were going through and <a href=""https://medium.com/relay-gse-follow-the-leaders/i-hear-you-i-see-you-responding-to-teacher-burnout-and-student-trauma-in-one-denver-high-school-abcdc4af49d0"">build stronger connections</a>. She and leaders like Tihesha Henderson, head of school and executive director of the Sankofa School of Success in Indianapolis, also recognize the toll that tending to students’ needs can take on educators and staff by helping them <a href=""https://medium.com/relay-gse-follow-the-leaders/i-hear-you-i-see-you-responding-to-teacher-burnout-and-student-trauma-in-one-denver-high-school-abcdc4af49d0"">reflect and reconnect with their peers</a> and <a href=""https://medium.com/relay-gse-follow-the-leaders/teachers-were-hurting-how-one-principal-invested-in-teacher-wellness-5108b493ba87"">tend to their own emotional needs</a>.</p>

<p>At Relay, we believe that nearly every problem has been solved by someone, somewhere. The challenge of the 21st century is to find out what works and scale it up.  With the <a href=""https://medium.com/relay-gse-follow-the-leaders"">Follow the Leaders</a> series, we invite you to examine the approaches these exceptional leaders have taken and the practical strategies they have put to work in their schools.  Each is focused on helping the students who need it the most by finding new ways to increase rigor, provide meaningful instruction, and support their overall well-being, largely centered in the classroom during the regular school day. As Chin puts it, “It’s not either-or. It has to be ‘Yes, and.’”</p>

908,"Arts Help Communities Connect, Heal, Imagine",<p>Local partners across Massachusetts are addressing social issues.</p>,"<p>LeLand Gantt’s performance of <em>Rhapsody in Black</em> was an entry point for people in an overwhelmingly White region to talk about race. This compelling one-man show exploring racism, identity, and self-image was presented virtually in 2021 through a Berkshires community collaboration.</p>

<p><a href=""https://clintonchurchrestoration.org/"">Clinton Church Restoration</a> is revitalizing a historic Black church as an African American cultural center rooted in the life and legacy of civil rights pioneer W.E.B. Du Bois, whose hometown was Great Barrington. This relatively young nonprofit partnered to host Rhapsody in Black with <a href=""https://mahaiwe.org/"">Mahaiwe Performing Arts Center</a>, a Great Barrington institution dating to 1904 that is making strides to engage a broader audience with work that fuels community interaction and dialogue.</p>

<p>“LeLand’s art gave us a great vehicle to talk about a difficult subject, racism, in a place where many audience members don’t think about racism on a daily basis, but where people of color face racism every day,” said Dr. Frances Jones-Sneed, a Clinton Church Restoration board member and African American heritage scholar.</p>

<p>Jones-Sneed moderated a post-performance online conversation with more than 50 people. “LeLand brings his own story, and in that story, his comedy and misery and whole range of emotions,” she reflected. “People can empathize with it. That’s what art does, it can show you another view.”</p>

<p>Across the state, an art-infused growing and gathering space is taking form at one of Gloucester’s public housing developments. The process of envisioning this “agriCulture” site, slated to open this fall and serve the diverse population of the Willowood housing complex, is already benefiting residents. Four teens received stipends and training in the summer of 2021 to invite neighbors to express hopes for their community and imagine uses of vacant land adjacent to the community garden operated by Backyard Growers, the nonprofit guiding this project with architect and public artist Claudia Paraschiv. Participants envisioned a place that would connect food, art, and people, with aesthetics that would be a source of pride and shared identity for all. The process involved community gatherings and input sessions that energized Willowood.

<p>“Our goal was to revitalize this space to be reflective of, and inspired by, the community,” said Corinne Lippie, program director at Backyard Growers. A series of designs were put forward and residents weighed in with their top priorities. The approved plan features spaces for growing food and perennials, an outdoor stage for performances and workshops, including cooking classes, as well as children’s play and picnic areas, outdoor art, and more.</p>

<p>Backyard Growers is partnering with the Gloucester Housing Authority and the Greater Cape Ann Chamber of Commerce to support this resident-led effort. Projects like these respond to the ambitions that Massachusetts’ people hold for arts organizations.</p>

<p>A <a href=""https://sloverlinett.com/news-notes/announcing-the-release-of-massachusetts-focused-insights-from-the-culture-community-research/"">recent study from independent researchers at Slover Linett</a> shows that 80 percent of state residents look to arts and culture organizations to support connection and learning. And 77 percent want arts and culture organizations to address social issues such as systemic racial injustice, income inequality, climate change, and political divisions.</p>

<p>We know that community-rooted arts organizations can be a wellspring of cultural understanding, supplying content and shared experiences that lead to individual insights, meaningful dialogue, and new collective possibilities.</p>

<p>For example, the Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohicans voiced its story of forced removal, genocide, loss of language and traditions, and resilience through a public exhibit titled, “The Mohican Journey: Homelands, History and Hope.” This multi-media exhibit attracted significant community-wide interest in fall 2021 and now tours area schools and community centers. It resulted from a year-long collaboration with the Stockbridge-Munsee community, Sheffield Historical Society, and the art department at Mount Everett Regional School.</p>

<p>In Lynn, a group of residents, business owners, and placemaking enthusiasts formed Beyond Walls, a nonprofit focused on large-scale works of public art downtown. A 2021 project, Taking Classroom to the Streets, provided about 300 area youth and their families with opportunities to create and relate to art in ways that spoke to history, culture, identity, and community.</p>

<p>These efforts, each supported by community foundation donors and program staff, illustrate the signal role that artists and arts organizations play in cities and towns throughout Massachusetts. That’s why, at a time of extreme polarization and eroding social cohesion, we invest in arts and culture to grow relationships and trust within communities. We value the change agents who are confronting racism and inequities, and striving for reconciliation over division, through artistic expression.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--time""> <p>a</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Art has unique power to help people and groups bridge differences and drive positive change. Community-minded individuals and enterprises across the public, private, and nonprofit sectors must do our part to encourage, fund, and bolster the efforts of artists and the organizations that present their work. Our cities and towns are hungry for the connections and understanding they can produce.</p>

907,New Tool Calculates Value of Public Benefits in Waterfront Projects,<p>Residents have never had a model or formula to estimate the value of public benefits – until now.</p>,"<p>As a Massachusetts resident, you have the legal right to access and use waterfront areas called “tidelands.” That right is so important that a state law – <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqEXKW8CANE"">the Public Waterfront Act</a>, also known as Chapter 91 – dictates how those waterfront areas can be used for real estate development. The law states the maximum height and overall dimensions of new buildings. It also says how much public open space a development must have and the publicly accessible uses it must include.</p>

<p>But what happens when a developer wants to go bigger or build beyond those legal requirements? What if their plans limit public waterfront access more than the law permits?</p>

<p>When state authorities grant exceptions to the law, developers must make up for any loss of public access. This usually occurs through financial compensation to the community, called “mitigation.” The intent is for that compensation to equal the value of the lost public access. However, no consistent method exists for agreeing on that value – and by extension, the payment to the community. Until now.</p>

<p>With support from our partners, CLF has developed an <a href=""https://www.tidelandcalculator.com/"">online calculator</a> that will assess the value of public access. The calculator will help provide greater transparency when balancing waterfront development and the public’s access rights.</p>
<h3>Residents Deserve Greater Transparency and Consistency in Waterfront Projects</h3>
<p>Every waterfront development should be held to the same fair and transparent standards when  making up for the loss of public access. However, current methods for assessing the value of that lost access have lacked transparency. Mitigation payments have been negotiated inconsistently with developers site by site.</p>

<p>That’s why CLF and our partners developed the <a href=""https://www.tidelandcalculator.com/"">Massachusetts Tidelands Development Calculator</a>. The online tool was created with HR&amp;A Advisors with funding from the Barr Foundation. The calculator provides the public with market information about the monetary value that developers capture by departing from Chapter 91 requirements.</p>

<p>For instance, the online tool can determine the additional private value captured by a developer that builds to 150 feet high instead of 55 feet. Or that provides 30% open space on the site instead of the legally required 50%. The calculator then suggests using this value to estimate the appropriate compensation to the public in the form of a mitigation payment.</p>

<p>Having the same market information available to developers, city governments, and the public helps level the playing field and increases transparency about financial trade-offs. It also promotes consistent expectations for mitigation payments, which can reduce uncertainty in the project review and permitting processes.</p>

<p>As a result, the tidelands calculator not only benefits the public – who can better understand the value of the trade-offs made – but also the development community.</p>
<h3>Everyone should pay their fair share – no more, no less.</h3>
<p>With a deeper understanding of the value of trade-offs, developers, city leaders, and residents can make more informed decisions about new waterfront development. Developers may even find it more cost-effective to meet Chapter 91 requirements. They also may decide to propose ways  to offset the loss of public access onsite, which could eliminate the need for a mitigation payment altogether. By allowing the public to engage in informed discussions about private gains and public trade-offs, the Massachusetts Tidelands Development Calculator can help lead to waterfront development that truly prioritizes the needs of the public.</p>

906,Planning with Purpose on Boston's Waterfront,<p>Three essential components to creating a waterfront all residents can access and benefit from.</p>,"<p>Boston residents are ready for change. At public forums, the voting booth and in the community, they are declaring loud and clear that we need to embrace a vision of a more equitable, inclusive and resilient city — including along Boston’s waterfront.</p>

<p>Stretching more than 40 miles from East Boston to Dorchester, Boston’s waterfront is a complex, interconnected and essential resource for our city; it encompasses housing, commercial and industrial areas, beaches and parks, cultural institutions and more. The waterfront is critical to the public health, safety, economic prosperity and wellbeing of every neighborhood and community in Boston.</p>

<p>In this moment of enormous opportunity, when the new administration of Mayor Michelle Wu has demonstrated a willingness to rethink traditional approaches — including appointing a new, cabinet-level Chief of Planning — how can Boston achieve tangible, sustainable and inclusive change on the waterfront? Along with community-focused work already underway on the waterfront, city officials, advocates and residents can — and should — consider examples from other cities that have embraced innovative and intentional efforts to improve their waterfronts.</p>

<p>In our work at the Barr Foundation, we have identified three essential components to creating a waterfront all residents can access and benefit from. These components seek to answer three key questions around any new developments: How does planning happen? Who is involved in that planning? And how do projects get funded?</p>
<h3>How Planning Happens: Coordinate Waterfront Efforts</h3>
<p>To realize a more robust, equitable vision for Boston’s waterfront, more intentional city-level coordination of waterfront projects, led by a single individual or entity, should be a key priority for city leaders.</p>

<p>In Seattle, the city’s Office of the Waterfront and Civic Projects is leading the development of Waterfront Park, a 20-acre redevelopment that will create opportunities for education and recreation, along with vital habitats and natural areas. The park will be among the most accessible areas of downtown Seattle, reachable by bike, bus, foot, ferry, water taxi, light rail and automobile. The Office of the Waterfront and Civic Projects is a city entity specifically charged with oversight of waterfront efforts.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--of""> <p>Office</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Such an entity does not exist in Boston. As a result, strategic planning discussions about the waterfront, opportunities for public engagement, conversations about financing and more are too often siloed in different areas of city government, bogged down by competing interests or deprived of the focus they deserve.</p>
<h3>Who’s Involved: Engage a Diverse Group of Stakeholders</h3>
<p>At the same time, creating a dedicated office or official in City Hall to oversee waterfront projects will not meaningfully improve things unless that office or official remains deeply engaged with every community impacted by changes to the waterfront. In Boston, we must be committed to engaging broad and diverse groups of residents, advocates, businesses and others, from the earliest planning stages through project completion and beyond.</p>

<p>Today, Brooklyn Bridge Park is a jewel of the New York City waterfront — an 85-acre park on the Brooklyn side of the East River that includes walking paths, playgrounds, picnic areas and more. Creating the iconic park required decades of evolution — from an initial, small group of advocates to a much larger, more diverse group of stakeholders who ultimately joined in the planning. At Philadelphia’s Bartram’s Garden, a public park and 50-acre National Historic Landmark next to a public housing development, inclusivity meant going beyond opportunities for residents to engage in planning. Park officials and leaders first had to help neighbors understand their right to be in the park and enable them to see their community enjoying the space. Clearly, the building blocks of a thriving waterfront evolution are rooted in community.</p>
<h3>How It’s Paid For: Share the Financial Burden</h3>
<p>Finally, given the scale of Boston’s waterfront, it is clear that the financial burden cannot fall solely on either public funding, private financing or philanthropy alone; it must be shared across sectors.</p>

<p>The power of collaboration and shared investment is reflected in Seattle, where the total Waterfront Park price tag of $739 million is shared between philanthropy ($110 million), city funding ($262 million), state funding ($207 million) and a local improvement district ($160 million). Going back a little further in Boston’s history, the Boston Harbor clean-up in the 1970s and ‘80s leveraged billions of dollars in public and private investment to safeguard the harbor for generations to come. As we plan for other ambitious projects along Boston’s waterfront, city leaders and advocates must be intentional about pulling in different funding streams to generate the necessary resources.</p>

<p>Our city, our community and our waterfront is unique. But as we look to respond to the public call for change and take bold action to make our waterfront more equitable, inclusive, and resilient, we can learn from the experiences and innovations of other cities. Both successful and unsuccessful, urban waterfront revivals can inform how city officials, advocates and communities connected to the waterfront in Boston can work together to build the future of this vital resource.</p>

904,"We Know Principals Are Important, So Why Doesn’t Anyone Want to Be One These Days?","<p>The pandemic is driving principals out, and preparation programs don’t give them the support they need.</p>","<p><em>This blog post was originally published as an op-ed on March 8, 2022 by The Hechinger Report under the title: <a href=""https://hechingerreport.org/opinion-we-know-principals-are-important-so-why-doesnt-anyone-want-to-be-one-these-days/"">&quot;OPINION: We know principals are important, so why doesn’t anyone want to be one these days?&quot;</a></em></p>

<p>Over the last two years, we have interviewed dozens of educators about school leadership. At the end of every conversation, we always ask the educator if they might want to be a high school principal one day. Their answers are consistent: “No, thank you.”</p>

<p>Take Sonjah McBain. As an instructional coach at a small high school in New York City, Sonjah was beloved by students, staff and families. She was credited with drastically improving students’ results through rigorous, relevant instruction. Sonjah was quickly tapped for school leadership, and she apprenticed at her school, where she added leadership tasks to her plate while juggling her core responsibilities.</p>

<p>But the more Sonjah saw of school leadership, the less she wanted it. As she looked around, she saw a role focused on compliance, numbers, testing and operations, rather than creating a high-quality school where every student is known, challenged and supported.</p>

<p>“I wanted to develop culture, systems, figure out curriculum and co-teaching, be with the students,” she explained. “Principals don’t get that time. So much of their time is stolen. It becomes easy for school leaders to lose sight of the building and what makes it work.”</p>

<p>After completing her apprenticeship, Sonjah was firm — though school leadership wanted her, she did not want the job. Not in its current form. She opted for an assistant principal position instead.</p>

<p>Sonjah’s story is one we’ve heard often. Additionally, many leaders are calling it quits, walking away from a principalship in favor of roles as assistant principals, instructional coaches, teachers — or leaving the profession altogether. Nationally, the tenure of school leaders has decreased significantly over the last decade. <a href=""https://www.edworkingpapers.com/sites/default/files/ai19-95.pdf"">One in five principals</a> leaves their school every year; the annual principal turnover rate in the highest-poverty schools is <a href=""https://www.wallacefoundation.org/knowledge-center/Documents/How-Principals-Affect-Students-and-Schools.pdf"">28 percent</a>.</p>

<p>In a <a href=""https://www.nassp.org/2020/08/21/principals-say-pandemic-conditions-are-accelerating-their-plans-to-leave-the-principalship/"">2020 poll</a> by the National Association of Secondary School Principals, 45 percent of principals said that pandemic working conditions were “accelerating their plans to leave the profession.”</p>

<p><strong>So, what can we do to attract, develop, and retain good leaders?</strong></p>

<p>Research tells us that school leaders are key to ensuring high achievement for all students and are powerful levers for change. School leaders can serve as multipliers — increasing the efficacy of a teaching staff, impacting an entire school rather than a handful of kids. We know that young people thrive in schools that offer them opportunities to develop identity, form authentic connections, find purpose and master competencies that are meaningful and linked to their goals for the future. We also know that, in the absence of great leadership, the status quo is failing students of color, low-income students, students learning English as a second language and students with disabilities.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--serve""> “leaders” <span class=""u-nowrap"">can</span> </blockquote></p>

<p><strong>In short, great leadership is essential to student success.</strong></p>

<p>Yet effective and innovative leaders are not born — they are nurtured. As Sonjah explained, “Had I had the right supports — and extended supports to make school what it could be — my motivation would have been there to be a school leader.”</p>

<p>In our efforts to understand what is driving Sonjah and others away from leadership, we’ve found that one thing is clear — principals are set up to fail. They are not prepared or supported to create the school experience that all students deserve and need to succeed.</p>

<p>Most principal preparation programs lack focus and practical preparation. While on the job, principals receive limited or incoherent coaching and support, which leads to feelings of frustration and isolation. When these challenges are combined with the inarguable facts that the scope of the role is often too vast for one person and district conditions make autonomy and change elusive, the result is almost inevitable: Strong educators do not want to be school leaders. Current school leaders do not want to stay school leaders.</p>

<p>Quite simply, the pipeline for school leadership is broken.</p>

<p>We must give prospective leaders tangible support, resources and preparation to enhance their existing strengths so that they become powerful advocates and change agents in their communities. As we ask principals to combat the inequalities that have surfaced during this pandemic and those that have been there for centuries, we need to create a leadership pathway that focuses on leading for transformation.</p>

<p>Research and effective principals tell us a lot about what is essential in strong preparation programs: prioritization of school leader competencies that go deep on instructional, adaptive and student-centered leadership; transformative learning experiences that bridge theory and practice; robust mentoring and professional development over multiple years; and meaningful apprenticeships that provide both fieldwork and gradual on-ramps. Aspiring leaders need to be able to try on the role of principal and understand what success can look like before they step into it.</p>

<p>Above all, leadership preparation programs must invest in recruiting leaders of color, and prepare all aspiring leaders to lead for equity, building their capacity to drive change in diverse communities.</p>

<p>There is no single action that will solve the broken pipeline; but in concert, these actions can help to develop and sustain transformative leaders.</p>

<p>It is time we look in the mirror and acknowledge that we can and must do better; we can create the school experience that all our students deserve. We can’t have equity and transformation in our schools if we don’t have it in our leadership pipelines and preparation.</p>

<p>Let’s transform schools and their leadership — together. We can give prospective leaders like Sonjah a reason to embrace this important role and lead schools worthy of the students they serve.</p>

903,Leadership Development Programs Need an Upgrade: Five Ways to Advance Racial Equity,"<p>Promoting, retaining, and supporting BIPOC leadership within nonprofits is critical for driving systemic change.</p>","<p>As the nation grapples with “the great resignation” across a range of job industries since the start of the pandemic, employment challenges extend to the nonprofit sector as well. Nonprofits are experiencing high rates of burnout and turnover, and many are struggling to fill vacancies. At the same time, the work of nonprofits continues to be lifesaving for communities that lacked adequate resources before the pandemic and have become more vulnerable since. Supporting nonprofit leadership at all levels is as important as it has ever been.</p>

<p>Notions of leadership are evolving, particularly as the nonprofit and philanthropic sector considers what it takes for individuals, organizations, and communities to drive systemic change in pursuit of racial equity and more effective outcomes for all. Leadership is not static, and it doesn’t sit with one person.

<p>With support from the Barr Foundation, <a href=""https://communitywealth.com/"">Community Wealth Partners</a> spoke to Black, Indigenous and other people of color (BIPOC) nonprofit leaders and leadership development program providers to help Barr understand how they and other foundations can support BIPOC leadership in the context of racial equity. Promoting, retaining, and supporting BIPOC leadership within nonprofits is critical for driving systemic change. From these interviews, <strong>we heard five actions that can have the biggest impact.</strong> Funders can consider how they might tailor and incorporate these into their own approaches to supporting leadership.</p>
<h3>1. Support leaders to change systems.</h3>
<p>While traditional leadership development programs focus primarily on individual skill building, many programs that center racial equity also focus on topics that are important for driving change within racialized systems, such as deepening self-awareness, understanding ways to shift and leverage power, and opportunities for connection and collaboration across organizations and movements. This work is emotionally draining, so leaders also need support for their well-being (see more on this below).</p>

<p>The Institute for Nonprofit Practice is launching its <a href=""https://www.nonprofitpractice.org/programs/black-leadership-institute/"">Black Leadership Institute</a> to connect, inspire, and uplift Black leaders who are working on systemic issues that have significant outcome disparities for Black people, such as incarceration and recidivism, health and health care, environmental justice, poverty, and education. Programming will focus on critical topics that enable Black leaders to build power and greater influence in their communities, including resources to expand leadership practices, deepen self-awareness, develop relationships and networks, and cultivate joy and renewal.</p>
<h3>2. Center relationships.</h3>
<p>Relationships are the cornerstone to building collective power. Leaders need trusting relationships with colleagues and peers to access learning, support, and create opportunities for partnership. They also need strong relationships within the power structures so they can leverage those relationships to drive systemic change. Funders can support relationship building by leveraging their networks and convening power to connect leaders to peers and allies they may not yet know. Interviewees we spoke to lifted up the value of leadership programs that create space for relationship building. For example, when program officers at the Annie E. Casey Foundation hosted the <a href=""https://www.aecf.org/blog/program-helps-young-leaders-build-sustainable-nonprofits-in-baltimore"">Baltimore Leaders Program</a> for leaders under thirty, they facilitated connections to people in their networks, helping leaders secure additional contacts and sources of funding.</p>

<p>Cohorts can be a way to help leaders build relationships with colleagues and peers. TSNE launched its <a href=""https://www.tsne.org/nonprofit-executive-directors-color-capacity-support-pilot"">Executive Directors of Color Capacity Support Pilot</a> to provide BIPOC leaders with adaptive, flexible, and integrated support through a range of offerings, including peer support and networking, participatory training, facilitated discussion, one-on-one coaching, project-oriented technical assistance, and access to tools and resources. TSNE recently completed a pilot cohort with 22 BIPOC leaders from the Boston region and is learning from evaluation results to inform the design of future cohorts.</p>
<h3>3. Prioritize BIPOC leaders’ well-being.</h3>
<p>Leading and navigating organizations that have been built within a white dominant model while also working to dismantle those structures and systems is complex, emotional work. BIPOC leaders need offerings that create safe space and prioritize their well-being. This could include fellowship programs, retreats, sabbaticals, or supporting changes in job roles and structures that allow leaders to create the space they need to be able to work in ways that feel sustainable and tend to their well-being at work.</p>

<p>“BIPOC leaders are serving BIPOC communities that have been historically marginalized. They may identify with those experiences in the community and the racial trauma that exists,” said Vernée Wilkinson of School Facts Boston in an interview. “As I’m advocating for students and families I serve, I simultaneously need to tap into my own trauma from similar experiences. Doing work together to process and heal is important.”</p>

<p>One nonprofit that is prioritizing BIPOC leaders’ well-being and sustainable leadership is <a href=""https://www.newsenecavillage.org/"">New Seneca Village</a>, whose mission is to provide cis, trans, and non-binary Black, Indigenous, and women of color social justice leaders with residencies offering time and space, access to nature, restorative practices and community centered around collective visioning for a just future.</p>
<h3>4. Give multiyear, unrestricted support.</h3>
<p>Unrestricted support is critical capital that allows nonprofits’ ability to invest in innovation, learning, growth, and operations. It also can support an organizations’ ability to attract and retain staff. Interviewees shared that a key barrier to being able to attract, retain, and develop talent is lack of flexible resources to use for compensation, hiring, and talent development. According to the <a href=""https://racetolead.org/"">Race to Lead</a> report by Building Movement Project, BIPOC leaders say increased philanthropic funding to BIPOC-led organizations would help organizations be able to attract and retain more racially diverse leadership.</p>

<p>General operating support is a key component of the Barr Foundation’s <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/arts-creativity/powering-cultural-futures"">Powering Cultural Futures</a> initiative, which invests in 15 Massachusetts arts organizations playing vital roles in BIPOC communities. Grantees receive six years of unrestricted support along with technical assistance, network development, and support building capacity to achieve organizational priorities. The program’s goal is to support these organizations’ effectiveness and resilience so that they can contribute to an equitable arts sector in Massachusetts that uplifts cultural expression in BIPOC communities.</p>
<h3>5. Invest in early to mid-career stage staff.</h3>
<p>Increasingly, leadership development approaches are looking beyond the executive director role and taking collective approaches to strengthen teams, support staff retention, and build a stronger pipeline of talent. Investments at early to mid-career stages, and focused on BIPOC leaders, are needed to maintain and expand the pipeline of talent in the sector who are ready to continue transformational work. The Center for Effective Philanthropy’s 2018 <a href=""http://cep.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Strengthening_Grantees_FNL_forwebsite.pdf""><em>Strengthening Grantees</em></a> survey found that nonprofit leaders cited staffing as one of the top challenges organizations face (second only to fundraising). As Rusty Stahl of Fund the People explained in the report, “Most nonprofits do not have the capital or the incentives to invest in their people. Most funders focus on the financial and program strengths and needs of grantees, not on the staffing strengths and needs. This dearth of investment can produce an unjust workplace, weak recruitment, poor work conditions, burnout and turnover, and unhealthy executive transitions.”</p>

<p>Our interviews found that those early in their career cite low pay as the greatest barrier for nonprofit employment. “When the lowest paid staff is earning one-third the amount of the highest-paid staff, that makes it hard for early career staff to feel like they are being valued as leaders,” said Kim Szeto of New England Foundation for the Arts.</p>

<p>Mid-career BIPOC staff named the importance of an equitable and inclusive culture for staff development and retention. One cultural aspect that mid-career employees cited as being discouraging was a focus on perfectionism as a barrier to advancement — something that is common in white dominant culture. “If the culture doesn’t embrace and support mistakes and failures, it will make it hard to cultivate good leadership and will create turnover,” said Melanie Gárate of Mystic River Watershed Association. “Leaders should model saying ‘I made a mistake. It’s ok to fail.’ This doesn’t happen very often.”</p>
<h4>Getting Clear on What Matters Most</h4>
<p>Recognizing that funders may not be able to incorporate all five recommendations into their leadership development support, here are some suggestions for how you might determine what to prioritize in your approach:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Be clear about who you are investing in and the change you want to see.</strong> When thinking about who, consider racial identity, career stage, etc. Also consider, what systemic changes are you hoping to see?</li>
<li><strong>Get input from your grantees.</strong> What would make the biggest difference to them? Start there.</li>
<li><strong>If the resources you have available are limited, consider giving unrestricted support instead of developing a leadership development program.</strong> Grantees we interviewed said a key challenge to being able to develop and retain leaders is lack of resources for competitive pay and professional development. Modest investments in leadership development from funders will have limited impact if this challenge is not addressed. As Caroline Saunders and Lucia Priselac of Grist shared, “In the context we’ve been working in, which has been high burn out and high turnover, there is no question having better pay has been huge to becoming a thriving community of people.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Regardless of what steps you take as a funder, prioritizing talent development and retention is critical — perhaps more so now than ever. Nonprofit leaders are experiencing stress, burnout and exhaustion. Recent <a href=""https://buildingmovement.org/reports/trading-glass-ceilings-for-glass-cliffs-a-race-to-lead-report-on-nonprofit-executives-of-color/"">research from Building Movement Project</a> found that about half of the leaders they surveyed were considering departing their jobs or actively preparing to leave — and this data was collected before the pandemic started. To move the sector toward racial equity and justice, funders should sustain healthy leadership development within nonprofits that builds collective power to shift organizations and systems toward justice and liberation.</p>

<p>Living through the coronavirus pandemic that has <a href=""https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html"">killed more than 6 million people</a> so far has changed us, and we will be navigating ongoing implications for years to come. From disruptions in the social, emotional, and educational well-being of our young people to the “Great Resignation” shifting our workplaces to the profound tragedy of <a href=""https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-response-reporting"">losing nearly 25,000 Massachusetts residents</a> to COVID-19, we have been altered.</p>

<p>As challenging as the past two years have been, we must seize the opportunity to reflect on lessons learned and how the pandemic could actually lead us to do — and be — better. Indeed, if there is one takeaway to embrace, it is this: We cannot go back to the way things were.</p>

<p>In the work of the philanthropic sector, of which I am a part, we have no choice but to <a href=""https://www.2022barrfoundation.org/""><strong>reimagine our work to illuminate the path forward</strong></a>. The realities of white supremacy, systemic racism, and violence against people of color and LGBTQ+ people — realities that are always present but rarely challenged by those with power — demand intense reflection and tangible action.</p>

<p>Today, philanthropy finds itself with a critical opportunity to act in new ways. Many of our institutions were created to exist in perpetuity with substantial endowments that have grown even larger during the pandemic. We are in a position to act quickly when the moment calls for it, which is precisely what many of us did by moving resources in an expedited manner and enabling leaders to make decisions about their best use when <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/a-year-that-changed-us-all"">COVID exploded across the region</a>, and when <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/barr-foundation-announces-4-15-million-in-new-grantmaking-centered-on-racial-equity"">our communities took to the streets to stand up for each other’s humanity</a>.</p>
<h3>So what are some of the key lessons that should animate philanthropy going forward?</h3><h4>First, foster authentic relationships with leaders and organizations closest to the challenges we aim to address.</h4>
<p>Such relationships build trust on both sides. They shift the funder-grantee relationship from a transactional one to a mutually supportive one, grounded in learning and shared commitment to action. As Crystal Hayling at <a href=""https://www.thelibrafoundation.org/about/"">The Libra Foundation</a>, a philanthropy that embraces practices that reflect social justice, <a href=""https://ssir.org/articles/entry/transformative_philanthropy_for_racial_justice"">recently wrote</a>: “If you want to create systemic change, step out of the driver’s seat and strap in as a passenger . . . funders need to give up the wheel and foot the bill for the fuel.”</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--to""> “you” <span class=""u-nowrap"">want</span> </blockquote></p>

<p>The pandemic has illuminated once again the importance of investing in leaders on the front lines in our communities, as they are trusted resources and agents of change. We must also make shifts in our own practices as funders and demonstrate trust by simplifying application processes, listening more and talking less, investing unrestricted funds, and enabling leaders to have latitude, all of which will serve our own effectiveness as funders.</p>
<h4>Second, work in partnership with others given the immense challenges before us.</h4>
<p>We should not confuse our substantial resources as funders with an ability to solve challenges alone. An emphasis on constructive and engaged partnership with other funders, with the public and private sectors, and with our nonprofit partners must drive our work. Private philanthropy plays a valuable role in catalyzing solutions, uplifting promising models, and investing in those who challenge power and question the status quo. Our most intractable challenges require these investments, and partnering with others is the only way to address the scale and scope of challenges today.</p>
<h4>Third, seize this opportunity to eliminate obstacles to racial justice.</h4>
<p>The recent reckoning with our own racism as a country and its implications have been in bold relief during the pandemic. In part due to our isolation, we have been forced to confront these ugly realities. Many organizations and leaders quickly lined up to assert that Black Lives Matter, and resource commitments flowed.</p>

<p>That, however, is just a beginning. We cannot expect a burst of support to achieve racial justice. Rather, a commitment to racial equity must be integrated into all that we do and the lens through which we make choices as funders. Now is the time to redouble our commitments and to recognize that achieving racial equity and advancing racial justice does not result from a statement, a set of grants, or a funder initiative. It is the result of hard, sustained work across many areas in authentic partnership with others.</p>

<p>Further, as part of this, we need to interrogate our own cultures with clarity and empathy. Our leadership, <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/to-advance-racial-equity-foundation-boards-need-to-take-an-active-role"">which includes our boards</a>, must be willing to have difficult, even uncomfortable, conversations. Indeed, these same boards should consider how to share their power with leaders who bring a diversity of lived experiences and expertise to the table, pushing us past conventional wisdom.</p>

<p>We have a rare opportunity now to ensure that we do not merely repair broken systems that perpetuate the deep inequities of American society. Rather, we must seize the opportunity to build something better for future generations.</p>

897,MA Residents Deeply Value the Arts and Hope for Change ,"<p>Post Covid-19 pandemic and America’s overdue racial reckoning, what do communities and audiences want from the arts and cultural organizations?</p>","<p>In early 2020, our team at <a href=""http://www.sloverlinett.com/"">Slover Linett</a> partnered with <a href=""https://www.laplacacohen.com/"">LaPlaca Cohen</a>  to develop a national research initiative that would bring both cultural participants (artists, creatives, and arts organizations) and the broader American public into conversation about needs, hopes, creativity, equity, and community. To date, the initiative has involved two waves of a large-scale online survey, in Spring 2020 and Spring 2021, plus a qualitative study in 2021 involving in-depth interviews with Black adults around the country. Barr’s Arts &amp; Creativity team also commissioned Slover Linett to provide “deeper dive” analyses of Massachusetts communities. The study raised new questions and made some longstanding questions more urgent for the arts and culture sector.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/arts-creativity/culture-and-community-in-a-time-of-transformation#research-massachusetts""><em>Culture &amp; Community in a Time of Transformation: Focus on Massachusetts</em></a> includes analysis and strategic reflections to inform the work of changemakers across the field — arts and museum leaders, artists and activists, funders and policymakers, and other practitioners working in, with, and for their communities. It explores the dynamics of race and identity in cultural engagement, the roles Massachusetts residents want arts and culture organizations to play in social change, perceptions of systemic racism in our field, and how digital engagement with arts and culture has been changing as the pandemic persisted. These findings come from a robust sample of more than 8,000 residents of Massachusetts and are compared with a sample of more than 75,000 Americans across the country.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--we""> <p>have</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Here are five of the findings that have been of particular interest in early discussions of these research findings:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In Massachusetts (MA), arts and culture organizations are <strong>vital to their communities.</strong> Most MA residents (65%) rated the importance of arts and culture organizations highly. That’s much higher than the national rating at 56%.</p></li>
<li><p>And the importance of the arts is not just a perception; it’s also reflected in <strong>high arts participation rates across the state</strong> during the pandemic in personal creative activities (93%), online engagement with arts and culture activities (74%), and community or participatory activities (57%).</p></li>
<li><p>However, most MA residents want to see arts and culture organizations <strong>change to become even more relevant to, and reflective of, their communities.</strong> Nearly all MA residents (92%) identified some kind of change they’d like to see among arts and culture organizations in the future. The most popular kinds of changes Commonwealth residents want to see include becoming more welcoming, accelerating practices of equity and inclusion, removing barriers to access, and deepening community rootedness.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition, more than three-quarters of MA residents (77%) want to <strong>see arts and culture organizations addressing social issues</strong> that matter to their communities. Systemic racial injustice was the top issue people wanted organizations to address at 46%, followed by income inequality at 37% and climate change at 35%.</p></li>
<li><p>Perhaps related to the importance of addressing systemic racial injustice, a substantial portion of MA residents <strong>believe systemic racism is present in each genre of arts and culture organizations</strong> – at higher rates than Americans overall.</p></li>

896,Filling the Well: A Podcast for Creative Changemakers,"<p>A new podcast series features stories from artists and leaders to harness creativity to shift power dynamics, avoid burn-out, and build authentic community.</p>","<p><em>Barr’s Arts &amp; Creativity program is deeply committed to capacity building for the field, and we know how much expertise is held by artists and community leaders who engage in this work every day. We are thrilled to support <a href=""https://www.artsmidwest.org/"">ArtsMidwest</a> to develop this new storytelling podcast where artists and leaders from around the country can come together to share ideas, successful models, and lessons learned with their peers.</em></p>

<p><em>“Filling the Well” covers a fascinating range of topics, many of which are all too familiar to our partners. The questions that animate our field also have deep resonance with how we all live now: 
How can we build back better? How can we continue to advance our commitments to racial equity? How can we imagine a future where artists and arts organizations can take more artistic risk? How can we ensure our programs are relevant to and engaging more diverse communities? How can we do all this and continue to practice self-care and avoid burnout? The “Filling the Well” team raises these questions head-on and explores how to manage through this unprecedented time.</em></p>

<p>The last couple of years have been incredibly hard. The reckoning that happened in the arts sector as a result of the pandemic and racial justice uprisings forced organizations to reconsider their common practices and reimagine anew– often without a roadmap. Amid all this upheaval, we’ve struggled to know how best to care for our communities. Now is the perfect time to take a step back to call out some leading-edge practices that can inspire arts leaders as we enter the third year of the global pandemic and fight the urge to “return to normal.” So, what’s next? Let’s start by <a href=""https://www.artsmidwest.org/resources/podcasts/filling-the-well"">Filling the Well</a>.</p>

<p>In this new podcast series, you will hear from ten creative changemakers as they share their takes on how to harness creativity by shifting power dynamics, avoiding burn-out, building authentic community, sharing resources, and advocating for support.</p>

<p>Filling the Well is hosted by award-winning journalist <strong>Marianne Combs.</strong> “It’s been such a pleasure to have these conversations with some of the most creative minds in the field,” said Combs. “I hope artists and arts administrators will find the Filling the Well series both useful and inspiring as they navigate the challenges and opportunities of this unique moment in history.”</p>

863,Transformative Schools Require Transformative Leaders,<p>New fellowship for aspiring school leaders who seek to reimagine high school.</p>,"<p>Together, our organizations have spent years advocating for the reimagining of schools—specifically high schools. We know that young people will thrive in schools that offer them opportunities to develop identity, form authentic connections, find purpose, and master competencies that are meaningful and linked to their goals for the future. On a recent school visit in Boston, we asked a panel of students what they would do if they had a magic wand to change something about their high school. One student said simply, “I wish we were more involved and people noticed us more.”</p>

<p>Despite national reform efforts, many high schools struggle to prepare their students meaningfully and equitably for the future. Though the graduation rate in Massachusetts has increased over time, post-secondary readiness has not; a staggering <a href=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/496/attachments/Barr_Foundation_Secondary_School_Landscape_Assessment_by_EYParthenon2015.pdf?1646850087"">55%</a> of students in the state need further attention and remediation to enroll in or be prepared for a post-secondary institution. Without question, high schools do not give young people the skills needed to pursue meaningful careers and lead lives of choice and purpose. The experience and outcomes of high school are failing our students. We are failing our students.</p>

<p>So how do we move the needle on making high school work for all students? Research tells us that school leaders are a key lever for improving high school experience and outcomes. School leaders can serve as multipliers—increasing the efficacy of a teaching staff, impacting an entire school rather than a handful of kids. Yet despite the critical importance of school leadership, both the role and the pipeline of principals is decidedly broken.</p>

<p>Nationally, the tenure of school leaders has decreased significantly over the last decade. <a href=""https://www.edworkingpapers.com/sites/default/files/ai19-95.pdf"">One in five principals</a> leave their school every year; for novice leaders, nearly half leave their schools within three years. This leaves us with a broken model for high school and a broken school leader talent pipeline—and the two are inextricably linked. Ill-prepared, inexperienced, and unsupported school leaders who do not represent the diversity of the students they serve are simply not equipped for success in their role. </p>
<h3>What do teachers need to become effective school leaders?</h3>
<p>Effective and innovative leaders are not born—they are nurtured. Educators need a pathway to build their leadership capacity in a way that feels supportive and manageable. Programs must provide what research and practitioners tell us is essential—a disciplined prioritization of school leader competencies that go deep on instructional, adaptive, and student-centered leadership, transformative learning experiences that bridge theory and practice, multi-layered supports for aspiring leaders over multiple years, and a meaningful apprenticeship that provides both robust field work and a gradual on-ramp to know and build success in the role. Above all, programs must support aspiring leaders to lead for equity—investing in diverse leadership and the cultural competence required to lead change.</p>
<h3>Preparing the next generation of school leaders to do high school differently</h3>

860,Fair Transit Fares for an Equitable and Climate-Friendly Future,"<p>As more fare-free and affordable transit initiatives are implemented across the state, voters support shifting the burden of transportation costs away from individuals to systems.</p>","<p>During my senior year of high school, I found myself waiting at a bus stop without a way to pay. When the bus arrived, I told the driver my situation and he asked me a series of questions that led to me sharing that I was headed off to college soon. Impressed with my potential, the driver let me onto the bus. This moment illustrated to me how unfair our systems can be and the burden that some fare structures place on individuals. Since then, I’ve often wondered, “If I wasn’t headed to MIT, would I have been left standing on the sidewalk?”</p>

<p>As I learned more about the climate impacts of car trips, especially short trips, this experience also helped me understand the collective benefits of affordable transit. If the driver hadn’t let me on, I would have called a friend or family member to drive me home. Whether it be to court, doctor’s appointments, home, school, or work, we all have places we have to go. So, while my one trip may seem negligible, when accounting for all the times that people would have opted for transit, but instead had to rely on their social network to be a transportation provider, we’re talking about a lot of unnecessary vehicle trips.</p>

<p>We know that transportation is one of the largest sources of climate change causing emissions in Massachusetts, producing 40% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the state. To reduce GHG emissions, we must reduce barriers to low-carbon transportation options. One way to do this is by changing the way we fund transit. </p>

<p>The good news is a recent poll from <a href=""https://www.massincpolling.com/the-topline/poll-massachusetts-voters-support-new-transportation-investment-taxing-million-dollar-earners"">MassINC Polling Group</a> shows that Massachusetts voters are open to a change. Most surveyed voters (70%) strongly or somewhat support an additional 4% tax on income over $1 million a year, which would be used for transportation and public education. A supermajority (80%) strongly or somewhat support making discounted fares available to lower-income residents. Respondents also expressed significant support for making public transit free.</p>

<p><div class=""Media - -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> </div> </div></p>

<p>Voters likely understand that reducing financial barriers to public transit is good for everyone. The impacts don’t just end at where people are able to go. Even as progress is made on increasing access to affordable housing and healthcare, many people are struggling to make ends meet. Reducing transportation costs means lowering the likelihood that people have to choose between spending money to get from their home to the doctor’s office or foregoing safe housing or medical care all together.</p>

<p>Here’s the best news: guided by community members and organizers, transit agencies and partners have already started making headway on reducing fares.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In 2019, the City of Lawrence piloted making three routes fare-free; in March people will be able to ride any local bus in the Merrimack Valley Regional Transit Authority system for free for at least two years.</p></li>
<li><p>The Worcester Regional Transit Authority recently announced that buses will remain fare-free through at least 2022.</p></li>
<li><p>In 2021, the City of Boston ran a <a href=""https://www.boston.gov/departments/transportation/main-streets-free-public-transit-pilot"">subsidized public transit pilot</a>, which provided clear data about the relationship between reducing fares, increasing transit ridership, and reducing financial stress. The City also worked with the MBTA to make the Route 28 fare-free, and has recently announced that the fare-free bus pilot will be extended for two years and include two more high-ridership routes. </p></li>
<li><p>A significant number of municipalities in the state have expressed their willingness to support efforts to further reduce or eliminate transit fares.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It’s reassuring to see the increased public support for shifting the burden of transportation costs away from individuals to systems. At the same time, it’s important that we remain mindful of why a comprehensive approach to removing financial barriers is needed. As a former public employee, the unintentional impacts of piecemeal programs aren’t lost on me. There were too many days when I typed as quickly as I could to help a resident enroll in the discounted Bluebikes program because the person who drove them to City Hall was waiting outside, often circling the building. My excitement about a constituent accessing the affordable and publicly owned bike share system was diluted by the thought of the extra emissions being generated in the process.</p>

<p>Well-intentioned policies that only account for some people often create inequitable outcomes. For example, through Transportation Demand Management policies, municipalities often require companies operating out of new developments to offer free or reduced transit passes to their employees. People working for third parties (e.g., the companies that offer cleaning services) are often left out of these conversations. Moving to a system-based approach for reducing fares would mean that everyone, regardless of their employment status, can access the <a href=""https://publictransitpublicgood.org/public-transit-public-good-coalition-issues-statement-on-the-new-mbta-board/"">benefits of affordable transit</a>.</p>

<p>It’s clear that Massachusetts voters, and increasingly the people they elect, support making transit more accessible by implementing system-wide mechanisms for reducing financial barriers. As we continue to shift gears in the funding and fare structures of our transit, we’ll all benefit from the subsequent impacts on the climate. We’ll be able to -physically and figuratively- breathe a little easier with each step or roll forward.</p>"
858,Boston Voters Value the Waterfront — And are Ready for the City to Help it to Change,<p>Responses to a recent voter poll provide a roadmap for how to maximize the benefits of the waterfront for everyone in Boston.</p>,"<p>A recent poll gauging Boston voters’ sentiments on waterfront issues validates two significant points: first, Boston voters agree that the 40+ miles of Boston’s waterfront are a tremendously valued public resource — from the public health benefits they bring the city, to its role as an economic driver for the region. Second, Boston voters are ready for the City to take on the types of bold changes on the waterfront — from expanded access for all communities, to additional funding for climate resilience, and new approaches to planning — that Mayor Michelle Wu championed throughout her campaign.</p>

<p>The poll, which was commissioned by the <a href=""https://www.bostonwaterfrontcoalition.org/"">Coalition for a Resilient and Inclusive Waterfront</a> and conducted by <a href=""https://www.massincpolling.com/"">MassInc Polling Group</a>, surveyed 622 registered voters in Boston from November 8 to November 15. The responses reinforce the critical work being done by the Boston Waterfront Partners, and help build an exciting roadmap for how organizations on the waterfront, advocates, and community members can work together with the new Wu Administration to maximize the benefits the waterfront provides to everyone in Boston.</p>

<p>A number of its findings are below.</p>
<h3>Voters value the waterfront for its contributions to the economy and to people’s health and happiness.</h3>
<p>Voters understand the waterfront to be an important economic driver for the city — two-thirds of voters say it is “very important” the waterfront provides economic opportunities for local businesses and residents, while 55% each say it’s “very important” the waterfront promotes tourism and serves as a working port. Voters are interested in participating in a number of activities on the waterfront in the coming years, and 70% of voters call it “very important” that the waterfront “improves the public health of the city by providing open spaces for exercise and enjoyment.”</p>

<p><div class=""Media - -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> </div> </div></p>
<h3>Voters are ready for the City to prioritize climate change on the waterfront.</h3>
<p>Thirty-four percent of open-ended comments name flooding, sea level rise, and climate change as the top issue facing the waterfront, and two-thirds of voters say it is “very important” that the waterfront protects the city from the impacts of sea level rise. Over half of voters “strongly support” additional city government funding for climate change protections in specific neighborhoods, and 75% of voters support additional city funding for creating a set of community benefit standards for developers.</p>
<h3>Voters hope the waterfront can be more inclusive.</h3>
<p>Waterfront accessibility is currently largely dependent on how close you live to the harbors and rivers, and if you can afford the activities offered there. Voters who live closer to the waterfront have an easier time visiting, with 54% of folks living in Dorchester, South Boston, Charlestown, and East Boston saying they have a “very” easy time, compared to 28% for voters in Hyde Park, Mattapan, and Roxbury, and 19% for voters in Jamaica Plain, Roslindale, and West Roxbury. Voters are supportive of promoting greater accessibility on the waterfront — 65% call it a “major priority” to create more affordable activities for families, and 55% support converting more land along the waterfront into parks and other public spaces.</p>

<p><div class=""Media - -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> </div> </div></p>
<h3>Voters support the City creating a high-level position to oversee a more integrated and holistic approach to waterfront planning.</h3>
<p>The poll showed significant support for the Mayor to appoint a cabinet-level official to focus on waterfront issues - an approach that has proven successful in other waterfront cities, including Seattle. Sixty-nine percent of voters support the creation of the new position.</p>

<p><div class=""Media - -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> </div> </div></p>

<p>Through the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/special-initiatives/boston-waterfront"">Waterfront Initiative</a> at the Barr Foundation, our goal is to empower organizations committed to creating a more resilient, inclusive, and economically vibrant waterfront. This latest poll shows that Boston voters share that vision for the waterfront’s future, and see the City as a potentially powerful partner to get there.</p>

857,Connecticut Voters are Ready for Bold Action on Climate and Clean Energy,<p>Recent poll shows widespread support for renewable energy sources and opportunities for greater education.</p>,"<p>In October 2021, Barr’s Clean Energy team commissioned <a href=""https://www.globalstrategygroup.com"">Global Strategies Group</a> to survey Connecticut voters on clean energy issues. We wanted to build upon the findings of our <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/six-things-massachusetts-voters-are-saying-about-clean-energy"">Massachusetts poll</a>, conducted in September 2020, and provide insights for our partners in Connecticut about opportunities to strengthen their public education and communications efforts to advance the equitable transition to clean energy</p>

<p>The poll surveyed 600 registered voters across Connecticut between October 5-14, 2021, and features a number of helpful data points about current voter attitudes towards clean energy and fossil fuels.</p>
<h4>Here are six illuminating insights from the Connecticut poll that can inform our strategies in 2022:</h4>

<li><p>While a significant majority of voters support a plan to transition to zero emissions by 2050 (68%) and zero carbon electricity (70%), voters are generally split on whether gas is a clean energy source, suggesting there is more work to do in public messaging and education about the role that gas plays in worsening carbon emissions.

<p>Connecticut voters also had a number of things in common with their neighbors in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>It is clear that they too <strong>are strongly supportive of bold and decisive action</strong> to address the climate crisis, including a complete transition to clean and renewable energy statewide.</p>

<p><strong>And as was the case in Massachusetts, voters trust scientists and public health experts</strong> above all others to convey the facts on energy issues, underscoring the importance of partnering with these messengers in clean energy advocacy and communications.</p>

856,Five Mobility Bright Spots to Build on in 2022,<p>We’ve been through a lot in the last 22 months. Are we less afraid of change?</p>,"<p>Like many others, I went into 2021 wondering if after a year of pandemic upheaval, we might regain firmer footing about the direction of Massachusetts transportation. Over the course of 2020, massive changes in how people lived, worked, and traveled made clear everyone needed to take a fresh look at every best-laid plan – but for what future?</p>

<p>Fast forward through a roller coaster of a year and it feels like we still have as many questions as answers to what may lie ahead of us.</p>

<p>We do know some things for sure. We know that ongoing systemic oppression has led to this pandemic disproportionately impacting communities of color, and that mobility can be a critical lever in eliminating longstanding inequities. We know that climate change is another unfolding crisis, and that a low-carbon and affordable transportation system will support healthy communities. And we know that after these difficult years, focusing our public spaces on joy and connection will boost our economy and our spirits.</p>

<p>We also have a growing list of mobility ideas tested throughout the pandemic that we should feel hopeful about as we look to what&#39;s ahead. Remembering that change is an opportunity, what can we continue to pursue that will lead us to a safer, more affordable, accessible, and sustainable transportation system than before the pandemic? The list is long, but here are my top five:</p>
<h3>Quick and creative street projects</h3>
<p>Since the start of the pandemic, more than 180 cities and towns in MA have made simple yet impactful changes – sometimes just paint, lines, and signs – to <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/climate/quick-creative-street-projects-measuring-the-impact-in-mass"">prioritize people on our streets</a>. In 2022, we will hopefully see municipalities continue making streets safer (and make many of these changes permanent).</p>
<h3>Transit affordability</h3>
<p>In 2019, the City of Lawrence became the first place in Massachusetts to test making buses free. Now, we’re poised to have three of the busiest bus lines free in Boston for two years, benefiting thousands of riders. And recently, Worcester and the Merrimack Valley voted for free buses too. Moving forward, it’ll be exciting to shift from pilots to a systemic change in how we sustain affordable public transit across the state.</p>
<h3>More responsive transit</h3>
<p>In early 2021, the MBTA brought the Commuter Rail closer to a modern Regional Rail approach by updating schedules to be more predictable and spacing out service more evenly throughout the day and evening. The MBTA also began deploying – in real time – more buses on busy routes to prevent crowding. Both of these changes demonstrate the flexibility we’ll need for transit to continue to meet our needs today, not two years ago, and adapt as our patterns change.</p>
<h3>The joy of biking</h3>
<p>I get more than joy - I get overjoyed – when I think about more butts on bikes. <a href=""https://www.bluebikes.com/blog/bluebikes-2021-year-in-review"">BlueBikes riders shattered records</a> in 2021, and trends across the state indicate that more people are dusting off the bikes in their basement and buying new wheels. It’s on us to keep retrofitting streets to make them safe for people to bike and to expand our bike network.</p>
<h3>Centering people who are most impacted</h3>
<p>From environmental justice legitimatized in the 2050 Roadmap Bill to Justice40, we should have hope – and continue to push – that people of color who we have marginalized for centuries will be welcomed and supported to lead on decision making. This is the only way to move toward our climate goals, and if we aren’t listening to and elevating the voices of people who are experiencing the most extreme impacts of climate change, what’s the point? After all, people know what they need.</p>

<p>On Barr’s mobility team, I also adapted to change as an <a href=""https://www.ef.org/person/mary-skelton-roberts/"">incredible teammate</a> departed, an <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/najah-casimir"">exceptional one</a> joined, and <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/mariella-puerto-named-barr-foundation-climate-program-director"">another stepped up</a> to lead our Climate Program. The whirlwind continues, and instead of shying away from change, I&#39;m here to celebrate it. Perhaps a lesson for us in transportation is that even when the future feels uncertain, we can all help shape it together.</p>"
855,Art Equity in Action,"<p>An interview with spoken-word artist, Jha D. Amazi about work she created with the support of a Live Arts Boston grant. Live Arts Boston is an initiative of the Boston Foundation and the Barr Foundation that supports performing artists, a majority of whom are artists of color.</p>","<p>Jha D. Amazi has devoted herself to creating spaces for spoken-word artists to share their work. “It grew out of the need I had for my own space,” she explains. “As I came into the world of open mics, it was obvious to me that, as a Black queer woman, some audiences were too White to understand my Black perspective—and my queer topics weren’t embraced by heteronormative crowds. I realized that I couldn’t be the only person experiencing this intersectionality.”</p>

<p>Amazi became the force behind an open mic series, which has given spoken-word artists of color and queer artists the space they need to express themselves. During COVID, open mics have been held outside. “What the pandemic taught me—and I hope other people—is just how vulnerable we are as a society. In a moment, everything can change. And it did.”</p>

<p><div class=""Media -D -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <div class=""FancyAttribution""> <p><a class=""FancyAttribution-link"" href=""https://www.tbf.org/news-and-insights/reports/2021/dec/2021-annual-report"">Richard Howard via The Boston Foundation</a></p> </div> </div> <div class=""Media-caption""> <p>Amazi</p> </div> </div></p>

<p>She calls the open mic scene in Boston a movement. “I do think there is an opportunity for real change today. There are a lot of folks of color, a lot of women and many folks under the LGBTQ+ umbrella who feel they’re a part of a movement regardless of what the headlines say. Because of that, I think we have an opportunity to challenge the status quo and demand a future that we actually want to live in. Artists need space, but more generally, they need a sense of agency and the resources to do the work they want to do and thrive. Too often I encounter other artists of color and other queer artists who are just trying to breathe, trying to pay rent, trying to live.”</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.tbf.org/nonprofits/grant-making-initiatives/live-arts-boston/lab-2021"">Live Arts Boston</a> has funded 310 projects since 2017, 82 percent of which have been led by artists of color, and invested more than $4 million in local artists. With her grant, Amazi is co-creating a series of flash mobs.</p>

<p>“A lot of folks come to Boston and are transient—they’re students or tourists or they’re here for work. Very rarely do they fully understand the Black and Brown perspectives of this city. So, the flash mob is an opportunity for us to say, ‘We’re here. We exist. There are multiple sides to Boston. Come hear our story. Come be curious. Come learn.’”</p>

854,A Different Direction: Tools to Advance Equity in Transportation ,<p>A new guide provides recommendations for transportation practitioners who are looking to advance equity in their work. </p>,"<p><em>Many of us talk about - and even try to - meaningfully center equity in transportation policies and projects. We have a long way to go. To get there, we have to know where we’re starting from and seek opportunities to learn from agencies and organizations that are advancing this practice throughout the country.</em></p>

<p><em>To help ourselves and others looking to do better, Barr&#39;s <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/climate/mobility"">Mobility team</a> commissioned <a href=""https://communityscience.com/"">Community Science</a> and the <a href=""https://www.cnt.org/"">Center for Neighborhood Technology (CNT)</a> to develop a guide that shares promising practices for evaluating the equity impacts of policy decisions in the transportation field. In the following post, the authors of the guide share high-level context and the characteristics that are necessary for agencies who hope to advance equity in their work. Keep reading to access the guide and sign up for the webinar to learn more about the tools.</em></p>

<p>Decisions in the transportation field have often harmed Black and brown communities: for example, freeway construction destroying Black and brown neighborhoods, federal funding policies for public transit that favor rail expansion to affluent suburban communities rather than urban transit service improvements, land use decisions that focus on polluting truck traffic in communities of color, and inequitable traffic law enforcement. To advance equity, we need to push transportation decisions in a different direction. The <a href=""https://barrfdn.issuelab.org/resource/tools-for-equitable-mobility.html?utm_source=CommSciMaster&utm_campaign=9c0a4b9006-email_211215_mc_barr_transportation_equity&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_995d992933-9c0a4b9006-"">Tools for Equitable Mobility Practices Guide</a> describes the landscape of existing equity assessment tools that apply to transportation and mobility decisions.</p>

<p>From our work, we have found that transportation agencies that have pioneered those tools share essential characteristics: </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Knowledge and acknowledge of past harms.</strong>  Before working to solve any problem, it is important to understand what the problem is, how it came to be, and who is impacted by the problem. To ensure that efforts to increase equity do not replicate past injustices, people and organizations need an understanding of the historical context and must be willing, to be honest about the harm that has been caused by transportation policies and programs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Understanding of equity.</strong>  Learn more about potential equitable solutions. All the tools in this guide rely on agencies having done quantitative work in their geographies to identify and measure transportation disparities and, even better, have determined indicators to measure transportation equity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Definition of equity.</strong>  Combine your understanding of current and past harms in your region with potential equitable solutions to define what doing better means in your community or agency. Start by defining the term equity, identifying principles, and setting goals through an inclusive process are early steps for an agency to advance equity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Commitment to equity.</strong>  Commit to doing the work. A public and authentic commitment to equity is needed at numerous levels, including leadership, board, and staff. Equally as important, there is a financial commitment to equity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Processes that support equity.</strong>  Infuse equity throughout your work so that you do not easily backtrack. Agencies that are ready for these types of tools have strong community engagement practices, experiences partnering with advocates and mobility justice groups, internal decision-making processes that ensure that equity is considered, established internal equity expertise, and a system for accountability.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In the <a href=""https://barrfdn.issuelab.org/resource/tools-for-equitable-mobility.html?utm_source=CommSciMaster&utm_campaign=9c0a4b9006-email_211215_mc_barr_transportation_equity&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_995d992933-9c0a4b9006-"">guide</a>, we highlight six promising tools for assessing equity impacts of transportation policy decisions and describe how and in what context these tools are implemented. We selected these tools in collaboration with industry leaders, funders, and advocates who are leading some of the promising practices in the field. Transportation agencies, at all levels, are the primary audiences for this guide, as they have the power and responsibility to change their behavior; advocates, organizers, and community groups can also use the guide to encourage their public agency partners to use the tools profiled.</p>

<p>Importantly, we also conclude that not every agency is ready to use these assessment tools. The characteristics noted above are preconditions for successful use – and agencies without these should take these earlier steps (described in more detail in the guide) toward equity before jumping into using the advanced tools profiled in our guide. Premature application of these tools, by agencies that are not truly committed to an equity framework, will turn the equity analysis into a performative exercise—causing more harm to communities of color and low-income communities.</p>

<p>Leaders and staff in these public agencies will have to confront the realities about the past and ongoing harms caused by transportation decision-makers. This means comprehensive tools for assessing the equity implications of new policies and programs need to be deeply integrated into decision-making processes and actions, and an explicit investment in building the capacity of agencies to implement equity tools in partnership with communities most impacted by transpiration policy decisions.</p>

We will host a panel of equity leaders from public agencies and advocacy organizations who have centered equity in their transportation policy decisions and actions. Hear their journeys.

851,How CultureHouse is Reclaiming Main Streets to Build Resilient Communities,"<p>The impact of a walkable, pop-up space in one Massachusetts community.</p>","<p>In his book <a href=""https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/557044/palaces-for-the-people-by-eric-klinenberg/"">Palaces for the People</a>, sociologist Eric Klinenberg demonstrates a correlation between death rates in the <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2020/03/31/824730922/what-a-1995-heat-wave-may-teach-us-about-responding-to-the-coronavirus-outbreak"">1995 Chicago heat wave</a> and peoples’ access to social infrastructure. Social infrastructure—which Klinenberg defines as “the physical places and organizations that shape the way people interact”—includes places like libraries, community centers, cafés, parks, and barbershops. In areas with less access to these places, he found that decreased social connection led to increased mortality (even when accounting race and socioeconomic status) because neighborhoods lacked the deep networks, relationships, and infrastructure necessary to ensure survival.</p>

<p>This finding is more pertinent amid the increased natural disasters, social isolation, and global challenges we face today. The COVID-19 pandemic has <a href=""https://www.wickedlocal.com/story/brookline-tab/2020/12/23/brookline-business-vacancies-hit-new-high-amid-covid/4031504001/"">taken away many of these spaces</a> when we need them the most—leaving communities lacking in vibrancy and without places to gather. These issues are front and center in downtown Peabody, a suburb north of Boston on Massachusetts’ North Shore.</p>
<h3>Creating social infrastructure in Peabody</h3>
<p>For years, Peabody—a gateway city of 50,000 originally built on the leather industry—has been missing something. While the downtown has the base conditions to be a vibrant neighborhood, it lacks the social infrastructure necessary for community members to come to and stay in the area. When the pandemic hit, what social infrastructure existed—such as the library, black box theater, and Breaking Grounds coffee shop—quickly closed and remained dormant for months. As restrictions started to lift, the desire to gather and rekindle community connections was palpable—but there was no place to do it.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--started""> <p>restrictions</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Luckily, a project that had been in the works for years was ready to meet the challenge. It started in 2017 when co-collaborator and Peabody resident Emily Cooper, reached out to <a href=""https://culturehouse.cc/"">CultureHouse</a>—a nonprofit organization that works with communities to improve livability, equity, and resiliency by transforming unused spaces into vibrant social infrastructure. Emily knew that Peabody had the potential to have a lively, equitable, and livable downtown—it just needed a spark. CultureHouse and Emily teamed up to create CultureHouse Peabody: a pop-up community space that uplifted untapped voices by working with BIPOC partners, provided a space for creatives and neighbors to reconnect, and set off a positive feedback loop of vibrancy downtown.</p>

<p>After gathering an advisory group of local activists and stakeholders, collecting observational data and conducting surveys with community members, and running a crowdfunding campaign to fund the project, we opened CultureHouse Peabody for a month-long demonstration on June 1st, 2021. The space, hosted in a donated storefront downtown, was set up with a stage for performances, work tables, lounge seating, cheerful lighting, stacks of games, and local art covering the walls. Outside, a bubble machine (yes, you read that right) made passersby stop and turn their heads in intrigue.</p>

<h3>Social infrastructure drives community impact</h3>
<p>Over the 33 days CultureHouse Peabody was open, it came alive with gatherings, live music, in-depth discussions, and new ideas. We observed four major impacts the pop-up had on the Peabody community—it provided a hub for businesses and entrepreneurs, supported artists, empowered teens, and improved downtown vibrancy.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>A hub for businesses and entrepreneurs</strong>: Through our weekly small business markets, we provided budding entrepreneurs with a space to sell their products without the high upfront costs of a brick-and-mortar store. We also saw owners of existing downtown businesses come into CultureHouse Peabody and discover strategies for incorporating social infrastructure into their services. By providing the foundation, CultureHouse created a blueprint for the business community in Peabody to grow and strengthen—in turn creating long-term vibrancy downtown.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Supporting artists</strong>: One of the professions most affected by the pandemic was the <a href=""https://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/COVID-Outlook-Week-of-1.4.2021-revised.pdf"">creative industry</a>. Even after the economy started to reopen, opportunities to earn income were few and far between. At CultureHouse Peabody, we supported over 50 artists to run workshops, hang shows, and play live music. For many of them, it was the first time in over a year they had been able to share their work publicly, and even longer since they’d been paid for their talents. It was also a rare opportunity for creatives to share work within their community—only 20% of the partners we worked with had experienced similar opportunities in Peabody in the past. The result was clear: Peabody is ready to be a hub for arts and culture, all the community needs is a space.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>“It was my first real platform for both [visual] art and music. I’d never displayed in the North Shore before and had yet to perform as well. It felt incredible to have a moment to shine in my hometown!” —Local artist</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Empowering teens</strong>: During our community engagement, we consistently heard that there were few spaces in Peabody where teens could hang out. To address this, we hosted artwork from the local high school, brought in a group of teens to lead a skillshare night, and created a space where youth could just... be. We heard from teens that participated in the programs that CultureHouse Peabody gave them a sense of connecting and belonging with their community.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Downtown vibrancy</strong>: Lastly, we saw an incredible impact on downtown vibrancy and connectivity with CultureHouse Peabody. There was undeniable energy emanating from <a href=""https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/09/23/metro/pop-up-space-peabody-served-community-hub/"">the pop-up</a>, leading to 83% of visitors reporting they met someone or made a connection there. With consistent programming, thoughtful design, and intentional partnerships, the space gave community members a glimpse into what Peabody could be with more social infrastructure. In fact, we saw a 60% increase in positive perceptions of downtown when we were open.
“It was surreal to have this kind of flexible, creative community space on Main Street and a reason to linger. It was amazing to feel, just for a moment, what it could be like to spend more time on the downtown strip—that it could be a cool hangout in the future.” —Pop-up survey response</p></li>
</ul>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--four""> <p>observed</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>These impacts did not come without challenges. Being open for such a short amount of time, we initially had difficulty getting the word out about the project and had a few events with low or no attendance. Even though the percentage of BIPOC visitors to the space was 3 times the representation in the majority-white non-hispanic city as a whole, we also ran into challenges reaching all the racial and ethnic demographics in the city. The small BIPOC representation in existing city leadership roles and our lack of multilingual staff limited our ability to welcome all identities in the population. Lastly, we frequently encountered misconceptions around what was possible downtown, with many residents viewing it as a place you don’t spend time in—a phenomenon made worse by the pandemic.</p>

<p>Though the pop-up was temporary, we hope its impact will be long-lasting. We collected all the lessons we learned during the project into an <a href=""https://culturehouse.cc/projects/peabody/"">impact report</a> which is freely available to the public. Beyond the report, we’ve already seen changes in Peabody inspired by the pop-up. One business started hosting open mic nights after seeing the success we had with ours. They are also in the process of forming a new nonprofit to open and operate a public space downtown with many of the offerings we had at CultureHouse Peabody.</p>
<h3>A new kind of public space</h3>
<p>Though this project was geared towards Massachusetts’ North Shore, the implications go far beyond. In his article. “<a href=""https://www.wired.com/2016/10/klinenberg-transforming-communities-to-survive-climate-change/"">Want to Survive Climate Change? You’ll Need a Good Community</a>,” Klinenberg adds to his findings in Chicago, showing how social infrastructure is increasingly important to create community connections as natural disasters increase with climate change. He notes that “when the floods come or the heatwave settles, neighbors are the true first responders. We must nurture those social ties.” Our answer is CultureHouse.</p>

<p>CultureHouse Peabody is the fourth community we’ve worked with to open a <a href=""https://culturehouse.cc/projects/kendall/"">community pop-up</a>. Past spaces have created connections between housed and unhoused people, boosted pedestrian traffic by eight-fold, and increased representation of women and Black, Indigenous, and people of color in the area. We believe that it’s time to create a whole new category of public space that meets the specific needs and wants of the people—all while centering the voices that are not being heard. We envision a future of vibrant, equitable, and resilient communities tied together by social infrastructure.</p>

850,Barr Announces New Grants to Drive Toward Educator Diversity,"<p>Announcing a new cohort of New England school systems committed to developing diverse, talented teacher workforces for student success.</p>","<p>This summer, in partnership with <a href=""https://tntp.org/"">TNTP</a>, we announced a new RFP for school systems to deepen their understanding of their current talent landscape in order to diversify their teacher workforces. Today, we are excited to announce nine communities that will receive grants as part of the Driving Toward Educator Diversity cohort. These schools and systems understand the importance of a diverse, talented teacher workforce in supporting their students to reach success. This cohort represents public schools across the New England region, of varying governance structures, each with more than 50 percent of their students identifying as people of color:</p>

<p>For the remainder of this 2021-22 school year, these school systems will look deeply at their own data, listen to their educators, families, and students, and reflect on their current approaches to their workforce. With technical assistance provided by TNTP, grantees will gain a deeper understanding of how well their current approach to recruiting, staffing, supporting, and retaining educators aligns with their vision and goals for diversifying their educator workforce, and identify areas for prioritization. More detail on this RFP opportunity can be found <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/education/diversifying-teacher-workforce-new-england"">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Background on this work</h3>
<p>Across the country, teachers don’t look like the students they serve. While 53% of students in the United States identify as <a href=""https://nces.ed.gov/programs/raceindicators/indicator_rbb.asp"">people of color</a>, 80% of teachers are <a href=""https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/clr"">white</a>, and 40% of public schools don’t have a single <a href=""https://www.academia.edu/37495556/Assessment_of_Diversity_in_America_s_Teaching_Force"">teacher of color</a>. This imbalance holds true in New England and has far-reaching effects on student experiences.</p>

<p>Students have big goals for their lives, and they are far more likely to reach those goals with access to more teachers of color who hold high expectations and deliver engaging, developmentally-appropriate instruction. Research shows that a more diverse teacher workforce benefits all students—but especially students of color with more equitable outcomes. Students with teachers who share their race are less likely to be suspended, more likely to be referred to gifted and talented programs, and more likely to complete high school and go to college. And TNTP’s recent research shows that teachers of color have higher expectations for students of color, which correlates with more learning.</p>

<p>The teacher diversity gap is a <a href=""https://tntp.org/blog/post/why-teaching-isnt-diverse-enough-and-what-we-can-do-about-it"">complex problem</a> with many causes and contributing factors. We are proud to join our partners across the region in supporting this work that can transform school systems and better support students’ needs and aspirations.</p>

<p>The Driving Toward Educator Diversity cohort represents the second major initiative of Barr’s Invest in Educators portfolio and we are eager to learn from this cohort as they gain a deeper understanding of their current approaches.

848,"Money Talks. Here’s What We Want it to Say.  ","<p>To center racial equity in the climate movement, we need to change who we’re funding and how we operate.</p>","<p>Centering racial equity is one of the Barr Foundation’s core values. In the case of Barr’s Climate Program, which focuses on clean energy, mobility, and climate resilience, we have also been deepening our knowledge and competencies on racial equity. As expressed in <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/racial-equity-and-barr-s-climate-program"">this previous blog post</a>, racial equity is now a more explicit priority for the program. The work is grounded in the belief that a diverse, inclusive, and equity-centered movement is essential to achieving our ambitious climate goals.</p>

<p>Our president Jim Canales, has frequently said that actions speak louder than words. For us, demonstrating racial equity means having clarity about our motivations, taking actionable steps, and committing to continuous improvement over the long term. We know that, if we are doing it right, this process will be a challenging and humbling experience.</p>

<p>As one manifestation of that, our Climate Program has committed to share publicly about progress we’re making towards increasing our grantmaking to people of color (POC)-led equity-centered organizations. We define equity-centered organizations as organizations that are building power in the communities they serve to address environmental racism. This is an important priority for us and the climate field.</p>

<p>When we took a hard look at the dollars and cents, it became very clear that we still have a long way to go. In 2019 and 2020, Barr made a total of $5.2 million in climate grantmaking specifically to POC-led organizations in our region. However, this represents only 10% of our total climate grantmaking in those years, a percentage we intend to increase significantly going forward. We’d like to express appreciation to the organizers of the <a href=""https://climate.donorsofcolor.org/"">Climate Funders Justice Pledge</a> for raising the visibility of this metric and asking the nation’s largest funders of climate action, including Barr, to assess our grantmaking patterns and to set ambitious goals for increasing dollars going to POC-led groups. According to their research, just 1.3% of climate grantmaking goes to organizations led by people of color.</p>

<p>Along with examining who we are funding, we need to look at what we support and how we operate. We’re developing our approach in conversation with POC organization leaders, emphasizing listening and relationship-building. We know that we need to make this pivot in a way that forges strong partnerships, while providing existing partners with support.</p>

<p>A big part of building relationships and trust means doing this work out in the open, where our grantee partners, other funders, and the communities we serve can hold us accountable.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--part""> <p>big</p> </blockquote></p>
<h3>In that spirit of transparency and accountability, here are the actions we&#39;re focusing on:</h3><h4>Providing flexible longer-term support and reducing administrative burdens.</h4>
<p>This is especially important for our POC-led and community-based organizations which often have less administrative capacity due to chronic underfunding. Working across the clean energy, mobility, and resilience portfolios, we’re consolidating multiple program grants awarded to the same organization and offering more flexible and longer-term support.</p>
<h4>Cultivating new relationships.</h4>
<p>Barr’s grantmaking is built on relationships, and we don’t want grants to be merely transactional. As such, we are taking the time to understand the landscape and organizations that play valuable roles in their communities. We are examining how our funding can be most helpful in the long term and are cultivating new relationships with POC-led equity-centered organizations.</p>
<h4>Investing in organization capacity building.</h4>
<p>We are asking POC-led equity-centered organizations what they need to build stronger, healthier organizations and power in the communities they serve. That could mean funding to increase staff capacity, provide professional development, expand communications capacity, or upgrade technology. In the coming months we will continue to seek input on what we can do to make deeper investments in this area.</p>
<h4>Growing POC leadership and career pathways.</h4>
<p>We need a diverse and leaderful climate justice movement to create durable change. Barr recently awarded a grant to One Square World to launch a Liberation Leadership program that will develop POC climate leaders in New England. Recognizing that people of color face systemic barriers when entering the environmental sector, one of our strategies is to support fellowship programs that provide substantial work experience and leadership development opportunities for people of color. With our partnership, the Environmental Leadership Program will administer a pilot cohort of six fellows in New England as part of its two-year <a href=""https://rayfellowship.org/program-overview"">RAY Diversity Program</a> for recent college graduates. In addition, the Department of Urban and Environmental Policy and Planning at Tufts University will launch a Racial Equity in Policy and Planning Fellowship program for Master’s degree students.</p>
<h4>Supporting authentic and meaningful allyship among the legacy climate organizations.</h4>
<p>As we make shifts in our grantmaking, our top priority is increasing funding to POC leadership in the climate movement. At the same time, we are interested in supporting white-led legacy climate organizations who are committed to making their own transformations toward centering racial equity. We believe this will lead to a stronger network of organizations committed to climate justice.</p>

<p>When the Barr Foundation set out to center racial equity in its work, we made a commitment that was unequivocal, long-term, and about both what we support and how we work. The Climate team is guided every day by that commitment. We recognize, however, that we don’t have all the answers, are still learning and examining our own practices.</p>

<p>This self-reflective moment for philanthropy and the climate sector demands transformative change, that is long overdue. We will not shy away from it. We hope our grantees, our peer funders, and others in the climate movement will join us in this work.</p>"
847,"Not Just Recovery, But Reinvention ",<p>Three lessons from schools where COVID innovations offer new solutions for student success.</p>,"<p>As educators work through another unpredictable year, schools must lean into reinvention. The sudden onset of COVID-19 forced schools and systems to change on the fly, required teachers, families and students to develop new ways of teaching and learning, and proved schools are capable of rapid and significant change. The old, familiar ways of doing school left too many behind, and as the country continues to face new challenges, we should embrace this opportunity to develop approaches that more equitably serve students — especially those who have been historically marginalized, such as students of color.</p>

<p><a href=""https://canopyschools.transcendeducation.org/"">The Canopy Project</a>, which our foundations support, tracked how hundreds of schools across the country adapted and innovated last year in student-centered ways. The adaptations these schools developed hold enormous potential to address longstanding inequities. Here are some examples from public schools in New York; Massachusetts; Washington, D.C.; Maine; Connecticut; and North Carolina.</p>
<h3>Strengthening communication and partnership with families</h3>
<p>During the pandemic, many schools enhanced their communications to build stronger relationships between educators and students’ families. At Concourse Village Elementary School in the Bronx, communication with families had been done mostly as needed, and the principal feared parents didn’t really want to talk to the school. During COVID-19, the school began a weekly electronic survey to check in with families — first about their technology needs, then, increasingly, about mental health, food security, and other challenges. Families could report positive COVID diagnoses, request assistance with food or technology or share other pertinent information. This fall, school staff built on that experience by designing a more comprehensive family communications plan, including monthly surveys, regular followup phone calls and virtual visits. School staff have a much better understanding of families’ situations, and families feel cared for and respected.</p>

<p>At Uxbridge High School in Massachusetts, failure rates were ticking up at alarming rates during COVID. This accelerated the school’s progress toward creating a system of individualized conferences with counselors, teachers and families to strategize about custom supports for struggling students. Virtual meetings made it easy for teachers to have quick check-ins with families. The school expects that transparency around learning gaps, and an expanded, multi-tiered system of support, will lead to more student progress and more equitable outcomes.</p>

<p>During remote learning last spring, it became clear to the leadership and staff at Northeast Academy for Aerospace and Advanced Technologies in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, that traditional A-F grades didn’t help families understand what students had, or hadn’t, learned. Educators spent the summer developing detailed rubrics for each class, and this fall the school switched to a standards-based grading system to make learning targets clearer and ensure families could understand their children’s successes and areas for growth.</p>
<h3>Personalizing supports to ensure all students get the opportunity they need</h3>
<p>To give students and families personalized sources of support, Washington’s Anacostia High School expanded its Dream Team program during the pandemic from ninth graders to the whole school. The program matches each student with an adult responsible for his or her development and learning. Non-teaching staff members and the principal participated to ensure there was an adult for each student. Students got extra support, while every family had a direct point of contact at the school and every staff member demonstrated the capacity to build meaningful, individual relationships with students.</p>

<p>At Common Ground High School in New Haven, Connecticut, student feedback inspired “What you need Wednesdays.” Students use part of each Wednesday however they need or want to — including holding one-on-one meetings with teachers, doing small-group work, joining peer coaching sessions or simply catching up, resting and recharging. This change built on Common Ground’s commitment to develop student agency and respond to feedback about needs and interests through avenues such as a student leadership group and internships to support school transformation.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--it""> <p>would</p> </blockquote></p>
<h3>Expanding the idea of where learning can happen</h3>
<p>Students across the country experienced learning in new ways and different settings, and while many online experiences were low-quality, there were bright spots where virtual and non-traditional learning models responded to previously unmet needs.</p>

<p>At Chelsea Opportunity Academy in Massachusetts, over half the students were working full time to support their households during the pandemic. This limited their ability to participate in required courses and progress toward gaining skills necessary for graduation. In response, school leaders are piloting courses that tie learning outside the school walls to core graduation requirements. Instead of earning traditional elective credits for their jobs, students can demonstrate graduation competencies through assignments that reflect what they are experiencing at their jobs.</p>

<p>At Nokomis High School in Maine, the pandemic expanded students’ and families’ vision for what school can be, increasing demand for more relevant learning experiences. So the school created virtual career development opportunities to replace traditional in-person job shadowing and internships. These will continue to benefit students post-pandemic by providing access to experiences beyond their rural setting. Additionally, 11th graders can now take their English class entirely outdoors. The class was designed to support physical and mental health, with a revised curriculum and instruction to complement the outdoor classroom. Over half the students selected this option.</p>

<p>These practices may have arisen during a pandemic but would be powerful in any context. What would it look like to fundamentally reinvent school to break down barriers among staff, students and families; prioritize self-direction; and create learning experiences outside the four walls of a school? These innovative communities are showing how it can be done.</p>

846,Boston Elects a New Mayor,<p>Jim Canales reflects on Barr’s longstanding commitment to Boston at this watershed moment.</p>,"<p>In a historic election, Michelle Wu will become the first woman and first person of color to be elected as Mayor since the role was created in 1822. This comes after one of the most diverse slate of candidates ever to run for the City’s highest office engaged in a thoughtful and issues-based campaign about Boston’s future.</p>

<p>My Barr colleagues and I extend our congratulations to Mayor-elect Wu as she assumes this vital leadership role. She does so at a time when Boston faces many pressing challenges, which can also translate to exciting opportunities for transformative and enduring change. We also express our gratitude to Acting Mayor Kim Janey, who made history as Boston’s first Black woman mayor, and assumed the office in the midst of a pandemic and provided steady leadership over the past nine months</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--partner""> <p>must</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Boston has been the Barr Foundation’s home since our founding in 1997. While our funding extends across the New England region, with targeted national funding, we are deeply invested in Boston’s potential and success.</p>

<p>Barr’s longstanding partnerships with the City of Boston over the past two decades span the core areas of our grantmaking in Arts &amp; Creativity, Climate, and Education. More recently, we invested in efforts to support the newly-created Office of Equity, under the leadership of Mayor Marty Walsh.</p>

<p>We have valued our constructive partnerships with the administrations of Mayors Tom Menino, Walsh and Janey, and we look forward to meaningful ways to support shared goals and priorities with the new Wu administration.</p>

<p>Given Barr’s position to be both stewards and catalysts for change, and our commitment to Boston for the long haul, we fully realize that philanthropy must partner across sectors to drive lasting change. In that spirit, we will welcome opportunities to build on the work we have done with the City of Boston over many years, with a clear focus on bold action, grounded in the aspirations of the communities we serve.</p>

<p>We wish the new Mayor well and congratulate her on her election.</p>

845,Three Things Boston Voters Think About the Boston Waterfront,"<p>A majority of voters agree with taking action to make Boston's waterfront more inclusive, accessible, and climate resilient.</p>","<p>At the Barr Foundation, we work in close partnership with community-based organizations at the forefront of efforts to transform Greater Boston’s waterfront into a more equitable, accessible, resilient, and world-class space for all of the region&#39;s communities.</p>

<p>The waterfront is closely linked to the long-term health, wellbeing, and joy of people throughout Greater Boston. The accelerating impacts of climate change, key decision points about how we tackle development on our waterfront, a potential influx of federal funding, and changes in city leadership are setting the stage for the coming months and years to be a pivotal inflection point for the future of this public space.</p>

<p>And once again, the city is going to be presented with the same question we’re already facing when it comes to our infrastructure, housing, efforts to prepare for the climate crisis, and other pressing issues: Is the way we’re approaching change working for all our communities? Or do the times call for us to think big, and consider a massive shift in how we invest in and think about our city’s most valued public resources? 
<blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--way""> <p>the</p> </blockquote>
A recent poll commissioned by the <a href=""https://www.bostonwaterfrontcoalition.org/"">Coalition for a Resilient and Inclusive Waterfront</a> — an alliance of more than 40 diverse nonprofit organizations focused on bringing the pressing issues facing Boston’s harbor and rivers to the forefront of the public conversation and an effort which the Barr Foundation enthusiastically supports — shows overwhelming support for the latter.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.bostonharbornow.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MassINC_CRIW_Waterfront_Poll_62921.pdf"">The poll</a>, conducted by <a href=""https://www.massincpolling.com/"">MassINC Polling Group</a> in June, surveyed 645 likely voters in Boston on the waterfront, their hopes for its future, and the significant work we need to do to create spaces that are truly reflective of, and a resource to, all communities in the city. Here’s what it found.</p>
<h3>Creating more open, accessible space on the waterfront should be a priority.</h3>
<p>First, it’s clear that the majority of Boston voters prioritize the creation of open and accessible places on the waterfront, even if that means less space for developers.</p>

<p>The vast majority of respondents — 87% — voiced support for the creation of new open spaces for public use on the waterfront, and 76% of respondents agreed with the statement: “The waterfront should be accessible to everyone, even if it means less land for developers to build on.”</p>

<h3>There is a lot of work to do to make the waterfront more affordable and welcoming.</h3>
<p>Second, Boston voters make it clear that we have a lot more work to do to make the waterfront a welcoming place that is reflective of, and provides opportunities for all Boston communities, to play, work, and benefit from this incredible resource.</p>

<p>Today, only 38% of voters think the city’s racial diversity is reflected in the activities available on the waterfront, and only 55% of respondents think activities and dining on the water are affordable. We should be alarmed that nearly half of all polled voters feel that activities on the waterfront are out of their reach. And let&#39;s face it, if you don&#39;t have a reason to stay you&#39;re not very likely to make the journey. That&#39;s a problem for those of us fighting for &quot;the people&#39;s harbor.”</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--be""> <p>should</p> </blockquote></p>
<h3>More funding and measures are needed to protect the city from climate change.</h3>
<p>And finally, in the wake of our rapidly intensifying climate crisis, the poll shows just how urgently voters prioritize climate change protections, and the vital role the waterfront plays in making all of Boston more climate resilient.</p>

<p>81% of those surveyed are in favor of additional city government funding for climate change protections for specific neighborhoods in Boston, and nearly three-quarters of voters agreed that “the waterfront can help protect the city against the effects of climate change.”</p>

<p>This is an encouraging sign and shows that voters overwhelmingly support the City of Boston taking climate change seriously. Less than a decade ago you&#39;d be hard pressed to find folks outside of the advocacy space that understood the science, knew the consequences, and had a plan to address climate change, and today, a majority of voters are on board with taking action to prepare our communities for the impacts.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--of""> <p>majority</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>The decisions we make now, the process we use to make them, and who we make them with, will have a tremendous impact on the future of one of Boston’s greatest public resources, and the communities that rely on it. Now, it’s up to us to work together — foundations, advocates, businesses, and public officials — to follow the lead of the communities we serve who are calling for bold and lasting change.</p>"
844,A Commitment to BIPOC Arts and Communities,"<p>Powering Cultural Futures connects and serves 15 community-rooted arts organizations. This multiyear initiative results from a collaboration between Barr, the Ford Foundation, and the Community Foundation of Western Massachusetts.</p>","<p>Today, the Barr Foundation announces Powering Cultural Futures, a six-year initiative that celebrates and supports arts of Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) communities across Massachusetts. The initiative involves 15 organizations that play crucial roles as art producers and presenters, cultural hubs, training grounds for new artists, and more. They are treasures in their communities, with trusted leaders who embrace arts to speak powerfully about the experiences, struggles, triumphs, and dreams of community members.</p>

<p>Powering Cultural Futures supports these organizations in their work to increase access to arts and cultural expression of BIPOC communities, develop networks of mutual support for BIPOC artists, and evolve BIPOC artforms and aesthetics. Each organization will, over the course of this capacity-building initiative, pursue a scale of operations that fits its aspirations and reflects the needs, hopes, and assets of its community. These cohort members will also contribute, along with Barr and our partner foundations, to bolstering the ecosystem of arts providers and donors that is vital to the flourishing of BIPOC arts statewide, and indeed to the vitality and creativity of all our communities statewide. </p>

<p>This initiative is grounded in Barr’s <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/barr-equity-journey"">belief</a> that action and sustained commitment are required to honor the vision of, and address the inequities faced by, those who have been most deeply harmed by white supremacy. BIPOC artists, arts organizations, and communities have for too long lacked access to the resources of major funders including Barr. Powering Cultural Futures is a step toward a more just and inclusive arts sector in Massachusetts. We take this step in partnership with the Community Foundation of Western Massachusetts and the Ford Foundation, through its America’s Cultural Treasures <a href=""https://www.fordfoundation.org/the-latest/news-additional-pages/faqs-america-s-cultural-treasures/"">initiative</a>. Barr <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/barr-and-ford-foundations-together-commit-10-million-to-support-bipoc-focused-arts-in-massachusetts"">announced</a> our partnership with Ford last fall and is pleased to deepen our ongoing relationship with the Community Foundation of Western Massachusetts.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--is""> <p>initiative</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>These partners, who share commitment to racial justice, arts, and community wellbeing, formed the Creative Futures Collaborative. The Collaborative, seeded with $5 million each from Barr and Ford, focuses on building the capacity of a thriving, well-resourced BIPOC arts sector in Massachusetts. Powering Cultural Futures is the first initiative created through the Collaborative. For Barr, this launch represents continued expansion of our <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/arts-creativity"">Arts &amp; Creativity Program</a> portfolio and reflects our holistic approach to strengthening the ecosystem that supports cultural expression across Massachusetts.</p>

<p>As the Powering Cultural Futures initiative ramps up, the Community Foundation of Western Massachusetts is also beginning research to inform design of a donor engagement initiative supporting BIPOC arts. Experimentation, learning and sharing knowledge are practices that animate all activities of the Collaborative, and we look forward to reporting more in 2022 about the activities introduced today. We also welcome involvement of other donors and philanthropies in the statewide Creative Futures Collaborative for BIPOC arts.</p>

<p>We are excited to join with and learn directly from the cohort of Powering Cultural Futures participants. The dedication and creativity of these community-rooted arts organizations inspires our work for racial justice and vibrant Massachusetts arts and communities.</p>

841,Student Feedback During COVID Is Inspiring Schools to Do High School Differently,"<p>Three themes from survey responses, and examples of how our partner schools are responding.</p>","<p>For the past eighteen months, the COVID-19 pandemic has challenged schools and education systems to find innovative solutions to new problems. At the same time, it has also exacerbated issues that had long been lying under the surface. While interruptions to “normal” schooling during the pandemic have been disruptive, they have also created an opportunity for learning and deep reflection about what was working for students, what wasn’t, and what could be done differently to improve student outcomes in high school and beyond. </p>

<p>In the fall of 2020, the Barr Education Program partnered with the national nonprofit <a href=""https://youthtruthsurvey.org/""><strong>YouthTruth</strong></a> to offer high schools across New England the opportunity to hear firsthand from their stakeholders through student, staff, and family surveys. The goal of the YouthTruth surveys is to provide real-time, actionable feedback that schools can use to improve the teaching and learning experience. <span class=""InlineTweet""> <span class=""InlineTweet-content"">believe</span> <a class=""InlineTweet-cta"" href=""https://twitter.com/intent/tweet/?dnt=true&amp;text=stakeholder""> <svg width=""48"" height=""48"" viewBox=""628 -718 2048 2048"" class=""Icon"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg""> <path d=""M2417.2-86.6c1.2,17,1.2,33.9,1.2,50.9c0,517.3-393.8,1113.4-1113.4,1113.4c-221.7,0-427.7-64.2-601-175.7 c31.5,3.6,61.8,4.8,94.5,4.8c183,0,351.4-61.8,485.8-167.2c-172-3.6-316.2-116.3-365.9-271.4c24.2,3.6,48.5,6.1,73.9,6.1 c35.1,0,70.3-4.8,103-13.3C916.1,424.7,781.6,267.2,781.6,76.9c0-1.2,0-3.6,0-4.8c52.1,29.1,112.7,47.2,176.9,49.7 C853.1,51.5,784-68.4,784-204.2c0-72.7,19.4-139.3,53.3-197.5C1030-164.2,1319.6-9.1,1644.3,7.9c-6.1-29.1-9.7-59.4-9.7-89.7 c0-215.7,174.5-391.3,391.3-391.3c112.7,0,214.4,47.2,285.9,123.6c88.4-17,173.3-49.7,248.4-94.5c-29.1,90.9-90.9,167.2-172,215.7 c78.7-8.5,155.1-30.3,225.3-60.6C2560.2-211.4,2493.6-142.4,2417.2-86.6z""/> </svg> Tweet This </a> </span> It was more important than ever during the pandemic for schools to listen to those most impacted by the new models of teaching and learning and use their feedback for continuous improvement.</p>

<p>Ten schools across New England opted to administer the survey to their communities last fall. We received responses from nearly 3,400 students, along with 300+ school staff and 200+ family members. The survey revealed many unsurprising pandemic-related sentiments, such as difficulty focusing in front of a computer screen all day and missing seeing friends and colleagues. As we reviewed the data and spoke with schools about individual findings, three broader themes emerged from across the survey responses:</p>
<h3>Three Themes from Student Survey Responses</h3><h4>1.  Students have limited access to challenging, relevant, personalized learning experiences.</h4>
<p>While students indicated that many teachers are accessible and supportive regarding content-specific questions or problems, they reported a far smaller proportion of teachers who take an interest in, and align coursework with, what’s happening in students’ lives outside of school. Further, many students struggle to see how what they are learning in school will be of use to them after they graduate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“[I’m] just not very interested in anything that we learn about. [I] just do whatever [I] need to do to pass and not actually get much of anything out of the class a lot of times.” -Student comment</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>2.  College and career planning is starting late in students’ high school career, leaving many underclassmen feeling uncertain and unprepared.</h4>
<p>In response to both specific survey questions and in open-ended responses, students and parents expressed that they had been provided with little guidance about selecting and applying to colleges and exploring career options. While this tends to be common among 9th and 10th grade students in many high schools, a number of 11th grade students—and also some students in 12th grade—noted a lack of post-secondary planning.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I felt as if I was completely thrown into the college process this year by myself with not much help or guidance from the school.” -12th grade student comment</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>3.  There is a disconnect between the perceptions of students and the adults who support their learning.</h4>
<p>Family and staff responses tended to be more positive than the responses of students to the same or similar questions about various facets of school (e.g., engagement; relationships; diversity, equity, and inclusion; etc.).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I think all of the staff and admin at my school truly care about students, but I think there are huge misunderstandings about our students’ needs and abilities particularly now more than ever and that can hurt our students.” -Staff comment</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As schools return to in-person teaching this fall, Barr partner schools are demonstrating that there is an opportunity to reflect on these themes and apply the many lessons learned from the past eighteen months so that schools don’t revert to what wasn’t working for too many students.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--demonstrating""> <p>are</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>When Jessica Waters, Executive Director at <a href=""https://www.nowellacademy.org/""><strong>Nowell Leadership Academy</strong></a> saw that her students were rating their feelings of &quot;Belonging and Peer Collaboration&quot; particularly low on the survey, she immediately instituted additional virtual learning spaces to encourage more collaboration among remote students, and pushed for more live instruction as students and staff returned to the classroom. She also used the survey data to support strategic planning at the Board level, sharing students’ insights from the survey with the school’s decision makers to further implement student-centric improvements in the upcoming school year. The school’s intentional focus yielded results: when they readministered the YouthTruth survey in the spring, students’ ratings in the Belonging and Peer Collaboration category had significantly improved.</p>

<p>Likewise, leadership at the <a href=""https://munizacademy.org/""><strong>Margarita Muñiz Academy</strong></a> could already sense that students were not fully engaged in school pre-pandemic. The YouthTruth survey results confirmed what the school suspected and highlighted that students were concerned about their preparation for college and careers. Armed with student feedback, Muñiz Academy has begun a deep look at the strengths and gaps of many of the school’s structures, including their advisory curriculum, instructional strategies, and continuum of student experiences, to ensure that all students are engaged in relevant, authentic, college-and-career connected learning experiences throughout their time in high school.</p>

<p>These examples are just a few of the ways school teams have incorporated stakeholder feedback into their short- and long-term planning, and YouthTruth is just one of many tools that schools can use to listen and collect data in an ongoing way. As schools welcome students back this fall amidst a continually evolving pandemic, uncertainty and change will likely continue to mark the upcoming school year. Regularly soliciting and acting on stakeholder feedback will be crucial for schools to respond strategically to what they are learning, to improve student experiences and outcomes both this year and beyond.</p>

840,Investing in Leadership for Racial Equity,<p>A call for new models and approaches to leadership development with racial equity at the center.</p>,"<p><em>Roger recently joined Rusty Stahl of Fund the People in conversation on Barr&#39;s work to invest in leadership development across many levels of an organization and the nonprofit sector. Listen to the episode <a href=""https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/rethinking-how-foundations-invest-in-leadership-development/id1531813289?i=1000534805749"">here</a>.</em></p>

<p>Investing in leaders has long been one of <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/about#core-values"">Barr’s core values</a> and a central focus of our work. But over the past year, we have seen even more clearly the imperative to invest in leadership and to do so in different ways, centered more squarely on racial equity. To address the urgent challenges we face in Barr’s focus areas of Arts &amp; Creativity, Education, and Climate, or in any of the many areas in which we need major change, we don’t just need more programs or more funding. <strong>We need new models and approaches, with people at the center.</strong></p>

<p>Over the past year, we have seen a critical need for <strong>leaders who can improvise, innovate, and navigate transformational change</strong> in every mission-driven organization (and by “leaders,” we mean staff across an organization, not just those at the “top”). Many organizations have redoubled their efforts to bring on BIPOC directors, board members, and staff, which is an important step. But if we seek fundamental change, our goal cannot be simply to try to advance BIPOC leaders in organizations and structures that remain unchanged.</p>

<p>So what does this mean? There are three areas that we’re exploring to advance leadership for racial equity. We encourage other funders and organizations to join us in this work.</p>
<h3>Three Key Focuses to Advance Leadership for Racial Equity</h3><h4>1. Challenging the basic concepts and structures of leadership and leadership development</h4>
<p>Central to Barr’s focus on racial equity is a commitment to listen to and co-design with the leaders with whom we wish to partner, who can illuminate new ways of working. We are privileged to be learning with <a href=""https://www.tsne.org/"">Third Sector New England (TSNE)</a>, whose staff spent a year working with and listening to leaders of small grassroots organizations to identify and prioritize the kind of capacity building they would find most helpful for the approaches to leadership they seek to embrace. In January, TSNE launched the <a href=""https://www.tsne.org/nonprofit-executive-directors-color-capacity-support-pilot"">Executive Directors of Color Capacity Support Pilot</a>, a year-long cohort program <strong>engaging participants working in community to co-create the learning agenda and including an intentional reflection and learning component</strong> for TSNE and the pilot’s funders. Significantly, this pilot is supported by a collaborative of four foundations – Barr, the Boston Foundation, the Hyams Foundation, and The Klarman Family Foundation – which stems from our shared belief not only in the need for leadership development but that we as funders also need to work differently and more collaboratively.</p>

<p>While some aspects of leadership models may be more operational (e.g., how leadership responsibilities are distributed), others can be quite fundamental – for instance, questioning and deconstructing board roles that have blurred lines between mission-focused governance and donor engagement, issues that directly relate to power and equity. (In fact, we have identified a critical need to include and strengthen supports for boards in these leadership development efforts overall.) Just the definition of who is a “leader” and who is the focus of “leadership development” is another key question to examine.</p>

<p>We know organizations are stretched with just managing their ongoing work, particularly in a pandemic. Organizations need time, space, and support to question and experiment with how they operate at a fundamental level: testing new approaches to leadership, organizational structure, services and programs, financial resources and sustainability.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--time""> <p>need</p> </blockquote></p>
<h4>2. Investing in organizations, not just individuals</h4>
<p>Most typical “leadership development” programs focus on the individual, with a predominant emphasis on skill development. Most are “pull-out” programs where an individual is selected to participate in a set of opportunities separate from their organization. They then return to their organization, expected to work in new ways, with a context and colleagues that have not changed. This challenge can be magnified with the increased focus on racial equity, as boards may be selecting BIPOC leaders either to change the face of the organization without understanding the need to transform the organization, or with the expectation of organizational transformation without adequate organizational supports for the new leader to make change possible.</p>

<p>Investing in organizational capacity, therefore, is critical for leadership development in at least two ways. For more diverse leaders to be successful and thrive, they need the <strong>organizational resources, technical assistance, learning opportunities, and other supports to make possible the leadership they can bring.</strong> And for there to be a viable, sustainable, and ongoing pipeline of BIPOC leaders – as well as organizational capacity to take risks, learn, and adapt in general – <strong>organizations must have the capacity and flexibility to invest centrally in their staff.</strong> In some cases, one basic element may be simply to ensure a living wage or just create paid positions, rather than relying on “sweat equity” that requires people to hold other jobs in order to support their mission-driven work. But of course, supporting the development of people goes well beyond that baseline. Grants for general operating support, with a focus on staff development, can make a difference, as can the provision of a <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/beyond-the-grant"">range of resources alongside a grant</a>.</p>
<h4>3. Developing approaches that span a region or field</h4>
<p>In most regions and most fields, nonprofit organizations are generally quite small. This leads to limited opportunities for employees to advance up a career ladder, or for organizations to do significant leadership development or succession planning. So each employee is on their own, looking for the next opportunity, and each organization is on its own, competing for people. This dynamic is very costly to both organizations and individuals. And one-by-one approaches, with one organization or leader at a time, will not create the sustainable change we need.</p>

<p>Is there a way to build more of an ecosystem approach, across organizations, with a focus on racial equity? On this issue, we at Barr mainly have questions we’re seeking to explore. Is there a <strong>geography</strong> where organizations might come together around a people development agenda in a collaborative way, investing collectively in the sector workforce and creating pathways across organizations? Are there examples can we learn from where a <strong>field</strong> has sought to do this?</p>

<p>There are also questions about capacity in the field to support organizational and leadership development centered on racial equity. <a href=""https://www.nonprofitpractice.org/"">The Institute for Nonprofit Practice</a> (INP) and TSNE found that even when organizations had resources or funding for organizational development, they could not find <strong>consultants with the experience and knowledge to effectively integrate diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) practices into their engagements.</strong> INP and TSNE are collaborating on the development of a cohort-based <a href=""https://www.tsne.org/deib"">certificate program that equips organizational development consultants</a> with the tools and practices to apply and integrate a DEIB lens in their work with clients.</p>

<h3>Investing for the Long Term</h3>
<p>These are not just needs for a time of a global pandemic, nor are they capacities we can simply call up in times of crisis. If we are serious about change – and particularly if we are serious about addressing racial equity – we need to support our partners and their people in the critical, ongoing work that equips them to carry out the transformational work we all seek. We look forward to continuing to learn with our grantees and others in the field as we continue on this journey.</p>"
837,Barr and TNTP Announce New RFP for Districts to Attract and Retain Talented Educators of Color ,<p>New England school districts can apply for free landscape analyses to help understand and improve the diversity of their educator workforces.</p>,"<h3>The Opportunity</h3>
<p>While 53% of students in the United States identify as <a href=""https://nces.ed.gov/programs/raceindicators/indicator_rbb.asp"">people of color</a>, 80% of teachers are <a href=""https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/clr"">white</a>. And <a href=""https://www.academia.edu/37495556/Assessment_of_Diversity_in_America_s_Teaching_Force"">40% of public schools</a> don’t have a single teacher of color. This imbalance holds true in New England and has far-reaching effects on student experiences. Earlier this summer, we discussed why teacher diversity matters for our students in this <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/why-a-diverse-teacher-workforce-matters"">blog post</a>. We are proud to announce a new opportunity, in partnership with TNTP, for local education agencies (LEAs) to receive technical assistance and funding to identify their school&#39;s talent diversity, its implications on student outcomes, and potential short and long term solutions.</p>

<p>Over the course of 8 months, selected grantees will partner with <a href=""https://tntp.org/"">TNTP</a>—a national nonprofit with more than two decades of experience recruiting and training educators—to better understand their current talent landscape and identify opportunities to recruit and retain more teachers of color. The three-phase process will be grounded in an understanding of local context and challenges, and will identify short- and long-term solutions that fit each LEA’s unique needs.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Establishing a Shared Vision and Scope:</strong> TNTP will hold planning sessions with grantees to learn what data is available, to understand what areas of inquiry will best support each grantee’s long-term goals for diversification of the teacher workforce, and to establish research questions for the scope of the project.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Collection and Analysis:</strong> Using the research questions established in Phase 1 as a guide, TNTP will begin targeted data collection - including collecting qualitative data from students, teachers, and communities - and will conduct analysis to examine the talent continuum. Some other data sources they will analyze include recruitment and marketing efforts, candidate pool details and sources, retention, compensation and career pathways, development, affinity spaces, and instructional culture.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Identifying Trends and Offering Recommendations:</strong> After compiling the data, conducting thorough analysis, and synthesizing trends, TNTP will share a summary report that includes findings, areas of strength, and recommendations to help grantees develop or contribute to their short- and long-term plans to ensure they have diverse and effective educator teams.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3>Benefits to Participation</h3>
<p>We anticipate that a cohort of up to 12 grantees will be selected, who will each participate in the talent landscape analysis at no cost to them, plus receive up to $25,000 in grant funds to support internal efforts devoted to the analysis. Grantees will: </p>

<ul>
<li>Gain a deep understanding of how well their current approach to recruiting, staffing, and retaining educators aligns with their needs. </li>
<li>Learn how the diversity of their teacher and leader workforce compares to that of their students, and explore advantages and key challenges in building and retaining a diverse workforce.</li>
<li>Gather important feedback and perspectives from local stakeholders, including educators, other staff, students, families, and community members—focusing especially on aspects that affect teacher diversity.</li>
<li>Identify patterns, trends, and recommendations for leaders to develop, continue, and accelerate plans to improve the quality and diversity of their teacher workforces.</li>

835,Lessons from the Pandemic for Building Resilience,"<p>A new report calls for investing in approaches that are people focused, intersectional, institutional, and rooted in anti-racist and anti-oppressive practice.</p>","<p><em>Pictured above: Artist <a href=""https://www.drawingimpact.com/"">Angelique McAlpine&#39;s</a> graphic illustration of a climate resilience webinar hosted by Kalila Barnett, Dr. Neenah Estrella-Luna, Penn Loh, and Lisette Le. See the full graphic <a href=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3581/original.png?1625671112"">here</a>.</em></p>

<p>Last February, GreenRoots, a Chelsea environmental justice group, was organizing residents to challenge a proposed electrical substation along the Chelsea Creek. By mid-March, those weeks of thoughtful planning and organizing became uncertain as the pandemic shut down almost all activity in Massachusetts. On March 11, GreenRoots convened a call with approximately 15 stakeholders to begin coordinating emergency response amongst community, nonprofit, and governmental partners. That call was the first of 65 consecutive daily calls among a network that grew to 75 people across 10 working groups. This pandemic response in Chelsea, and other working class communities of color, was not just heroic, but an example of resilience in action.</p>

<p>Many other groups found themselves in a similar situation to GreenRoots, pivoting rapidly to provide aid and services. VietAID, a community development corporation serving the Vietnamese-American community in Dorchester, began hosting a weekly food distribution hub serving hundreds every week. The Black Economic Justice Institute distributed $20,000 in gift cards and laundry cards and, as part of the Black Boston COVID-19 Coalition, brought 1,200 people out to the first weekend of mass COVID testing in Roxbury. Mutual Aid Eastie brought together volunteers and East Boston organizations, including Center for Cooperative Development and Solidarity, Neighbors United for a Better East Boston, and Eastie Farm, to deliver 5,000 meals each week in May and June. Matahari Women’s Worker Center trained 20 multilingual volunteers to assist individuals with applying for assistance and helped create the Mass UndocuFund by late March to provide aid for undocumented workers who were not eligible for COVID relief.</p>

<p>When it came to responding to COVID-19, the gap between government response and the needs of historically excluded communities was bridged by nonprofits and networks like the advocates in Chelsea. We wanted to better understand how nonprofits and networks bridged this gap and supported their communities in the early months of the pandemic. Their actions provided a window into what is required to build resilience for climate impacts which we describe in our recent report <a href=""https://barrfdn.issuelab.org/resource/opportunities-to-invest-in-community-resilience-for-covid-and-climate.html""><em>Opportunities to Invest in Community Resilience for COVID and Climate</em></a>.</p>

<p>In the process of creating this report, we learned three key lessons from the 30 individuals, representing 18 organizations in Boston, Chelsea, and Revere, who shared their pandemic response stories with us.</p>
<h3>1. Racism is at the root of vulnerability</h3>
<p>Racism and other systems of oppression are the primary drivers behind the inequities we saw and continue to see. The communities most vulnerable to, and most burdened by economic, housing, and educational injustices are where we found the highest COVID infection and death rates. They were also the communities denied early access to vaccines despite being at the highest risk of exposure. What COVID made clear to the community-based organizations we spoke with is that resilience in the face of a pandemic, climate change, or any other impact is not possible without dismantling racism and other systems of oppression. It was these systems and their impacts that created the devastating inequities seen throughout the pandemic. These disparities will be replicated in climate emergencies until there is a firm and focused commitment to racial justice.</p>

<h3>2. Resilience requires investing in equity-centered organizations</h3>
<p>We should not limit building climate resilience to clean energy infrastructure, building adaptation, or to climate mitigation measures. Resilience is fundamentally a social concept about how people respond and adapt to shocks. Therefore, building resilience means investing in the organizations and efforts focused on strengthening community and the capacity to work with and care for one another. Resilience should not be about bouncing back to a status quo of structural racism and inequalities; it requires centering equity by challenging systemic injustice and advocating for change. In order to build society-wide resilience, funder priorities need to shift from investing in programs and products to long-term, unrestricted, and sustained investments in the capacity and infrastructure of grassroots, community-based organizations building movements for social change. It will also require trust-based grantmaking approaches, or perhaps extending the same trust to equity-centered organizations that is typically provided to mainstream or White-led nonprofit organizations.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3680/small.jpg?1642128059 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3680/medium.jpg?1642128059 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3680/large.jpg?1642128059 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3680/x_large.jpg?1642128059 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""InvestandTrust"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3680/small.jpg?1642128059"" /> </div> </div>

<h3>3. Supporting network building is a key resilience strategy</h3>
<p>The strongest and most sustained COVID response efforts were those coordinated by individuals and organizations who were part of pre-existing networks. Creating or supporting the structures for relationship and trust building between community-based, grassroots, and social movement organizations lays the foundation for sustainable resilience. These efforts should be funded in addition to, and not at the expense of, core support to frontline organizations. We recommend learning exchanges for foundations to learn from equity-centered, community-based organizations about how to invest in a people-centered, intersectional, anti-racist approach to building resilience.</p>

<p>Community-based responses to COVID are building resilience that can also respond to climate and other impacts. It’s important to note that grassroots organizations should never be relied upon as a substitute for adequate and equitable governmental response. Indeed, these organizations exist because of the long history and unresolved legacy of exclusion, neglect, and social marginalization.</p>

<p>Foundations can and should play a role in changing the systems that create vulnerability in the first place. They can do this by engaging in long-term, trust-based investment in community building aimed at dismantling racism and other systems of oppression.</p>

832,Why A Diverse Teacher Workforce Matters,<p>Barr and TNTP discuss the critical role diverse educator workforces play in advancing equity and highlight a new funding opportunity for New England schools.</p>,"<p>Across the country, teachers don’t look like the students they serve. While 53% of students in the United States identify as <a href=""https://nces.ed.gov/programs/raceindicators/indicator_rbb.asp"">people of color</a>, 80% of teachers are <a href=""https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/clr"">white</a>, and 40% of public schools don’t have a single <a href=""https://www.academia.edu/37495556/Assessment_of_Diversity_in_America_s_Teaching_Force"">teacher of color</a>. This imbalance holds true in New England and has far-reaching effects on student experiences.</p>

<p>Students have big goals for their lives, and they are far more likely to reach those goals with access to more teachers of color who hold high expectations and deliver engaging, developmentally-appropriate instruction. Research shows that a more diverse teacher workforce benefits all students—but especially students of color with more equitable outcomes. Students with teachers who share their race are less likely to be suspended, more likely to be referred to gifted and talented programs, and more likely to complete high school and go to college. And TNTP’s <a href=""https://opportunitymyth.tntp.org/"">recent research</a> shows that teachers of color have higher expectations for students of color, which correlates with more learning.</p>

<p>The teacher diversity gap is a <a href=""https://tntp.org/blog/post/why-teaching-isnt-diverse-enough-and-what-we-can-do-about-it"">complex problem</a> with many causes and contributing factors, from recruitment and hiring processes, to certification processes which pose barriers, to school cultures that often fail to help teachers of color build long careers in the classroom. But there’s never been a more important moment to tackle this challenge. Educators, school leaders, parents, students, and advocates, including Barr’s partners, seek to transform education systems that have historically failed people of color, and issue urgent calls to meet our students’ needs.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--on""> <p>research</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>At Barr, we believe that every student deserves a high-quality education, where they are known, challenged, and supported. TNTP has over 20 years of experience partnering with schools and educators to close achievement gaps, improve classroom instruction, and develop talented, diverse educator workforces. The research on teacher diversity is clear: talented teachers of color support all students, and especially students of color, in meeting their goals and connecting with success after graduation. We are excited to partner together to advance a more diverse and highly-skilled educator workforce in New England.</p>
<h3>Previewing Talent Landscape Analysis Opportunity for New England Local Education Agencies (LEA’s)</h3>
<p>To create more equitable experiences for students, school networks need long-term plans to attract, support, and retain teachers of color. That can only happen with a close look at their current talent systems and practices.</p>

<p>To support this work, the Barr Foundation is proud to preview a new initiative, in partnership with TNTP, to support a cohort of New England public schools (all governance structures) with a comprehensive analysis of their current teacher workforces.

831,How Grantmakers and Governments Moved Quickly to Transform Public Spaces,<p>The COVID pandemic pushed Massachusetts cities and towns to rethink their public spaces. It also pushed us as funders to rethink how we do our work.</p>,"<p>In 2020, communities around the world were thrust into crisis—a devastating public health threat that also completely upended how we interact with each other and our surroundings. The infrastructure we all relied upon to move around our cities and connect with our neighbors suddenly felt riskier, if not inaccessible.</p>

<p>Here in Massachusetts, a state with dense town centers, heavy reliance on public transit in Eastern Massachusetts, skinny streets and sidewalks, and an unshakeable fondness for gathering together, it became clear that we needed to change our streets and public spaces—and fast.</p>

<p>In response, a joint funding effort emerged, groundbreaking in its speed and flexibility. Funded by the Baker-Polito Administration with support from the Barr and Solomon foundations, <a href=""https://www.mass.gov/shared-streets-and-spaces-grant-program"">Shared Streets and Spaces</a> would go on to <a href=""https://www.mass.gov/lists/shared-streets-press-releases"">support more than 300 projects</a> spanning from Pittsfield to Provincetown, all of which made our daily lives safer and more socially connected during these vulnerable and isolating times, while propping up small businesses and local economies.</p>

<p>The initiative showed us what kind of infrastructure change is possible in weeks and months, not years. It also taught philanthropic funders just what is possible when you move money with greater speed and flexibility—and in close partnership with community groups and the public sector—to meet local needs. It taught the public sector that there is <a href=""https://www.massincpolling.com/the-topline/boston-area-voters-support-changes-to-local-streets-even-if-it-means-less-space-for-cars"">meaningful local demand</a> for these types of installations.</p>

<p>The results have been remarkable, and a little surprising, considering this is not how we normally operate, nor is it work we had planned to fund pre-COVID. We’re particularly proud of the fact that more than half of the projects were built in environmental justice communities. But perhaps most impressive is the range of projects funded, based on each locality’s unique needs. There’s a good chance you noticed one of them pop up in your own neighborhood.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In places like Lynn and Everett, priority bus lanes were quickly installed to make public transportation safer and more reliable for essential workers. Other bus improvements—including changes to traffic signal patterns, and improved shelters in places like Boston, Brockton, and Tewksbury—were prioritized to reduce overcrowding and increase efficiency.</p></li>
<li><p>Cycling underwent a renaissance in 2020 as a fast, healthy, and socially distanced way to get around. Funded projects included new bikeshare stations from Holyoke to Salem, expanded bicycle parking, and new protected bike lanes and trails. </p></li>
<li><p>Communities across the state saw increased need for safe walking and access to paths and trails, especially among seniors and youth. There was incredible demand, and many projects helped kids get to school and older adults get to senior centers, residences, and town centers safely.</p></li>
<li><p>Streets and parking spots were repurposed to allow safe outdoor socializing and boost local business. Barriers adorned by local artists protected tables and chairs from traffic. Communities like Natick, Peabody, Melrose, and New Bedford installed street furniture, public art, and decorative lighting to help residents connect during the long, dark winter.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These may seem minor, but those of us who work in mobility know that small adjustments can improve lives and add up to transformative change. This approach also unlocked permanent infrastructure improvements, on far faster timelines than municipalities generally believe to be possible.</p>

<p>While such planning usually involves lengthy discussion of hypothetical pros and cons, we were able to test out projects with inexpensive, temporary materials that had immediate positive impact. This then allowed residents to experience the benefits right away, helped planners, municipal staff, and community members iterate their concepts based on real world use, and informed longer-lasting improvements. Many communities, quickly recognizing the shared benefits of multi-use streets and plazas, are already moving to make these changes permanent.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--quickly""> <p>communities</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Municipal governments are clearly learning a lot, but what about the philanthropic and state partners? We all needed to rethink our way of working to be as responsive as possible. Here’s how we pivoted to meet the needs:</p>

<p><strong>Funding was fast and flexible.</strong> The most important part of the program was that it needed to move money and complete projects quickly. The Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) set up a rolling application and encouraged quick-build projects that would have an impact right away. State and foundation grantmaking guidelines were kept intentionally straightforward, allowing communities to lead the way in identifying their greatest needs and designing the right solutions. Foundations helped applicants craft their applications through easy-to-access technical assistance, expediting their grant proposals.</p>

<p><strong>MassDOT and private philanthropy worked in close partnership.</strong> In a chaotic time when we were all facing problems we’d never dealt with before, we were able to lean on our long-standing relationship. The trust existed among multiple entities which made the work go remarkably smoothly. The Solomon Foundation in particular stood this up by holding weekly convenings of a wide range of interested parties to coordinate, avoid pitfalls, and replicate success.</p>

<p><strong>We funded more than just projects.</strong> This was an all-hands-on-deck moment. So philanthropic partners were able to provide funding, but also supplemented local efforts with technical assistance, evaluation, and communications support. The Barr Foundation supported technical guidance to help applicants design successful projects and proposals, thereby allowing more grantees to access the MassDOT program, even if their own resources were limited.</p>

<p>The Shared Streets and Spaces program has helped Massachusetts reimagine its streets as public spaces for people. It also helped the government and philanthropic partners behind the program reset their expectations about how fast they could move and how closely they might work together. This was a unique, difficult moment in time, but also one that can inform how we work going forward.</p>

<p>We now know that, with the right community support and leadership, it’s possible to create a new bike lane, public plaza, and new options for seniors and children in a matter of weeks instead of months or years. Some of the processes we’ve relied on for decades weren’t necessarily helpful to us. Now that we know what government and foundations can do when we listen and are truly responsive to communities’ needs, what might we do next?</p>

830,Designing Employee Leave Policies that Reflect Our Values,"<p>What we learned from reviewing our employee handbook through a lens of diversity, equity, and inclusion.</p>","<p>Over the last several years, the Barr Foundation has been on a journey to center equity in all we do, from our grantmaking to our organizational practices. Many of our colleagues have reported on the steps Barr is taking to transform our grantmaking policies and practices. We want to turn the spotlight inward and share some work we have done to change a set of internal policies. We are two members of a staff-led task force charged with examining our employee leave policies through a lens of diversity, equity, and inclusion.</p>

<p>Over the course of 18 months, we engaged in many discussions, conducted research, and iterated our policies before presenting them to Barr staff and trustees. We learned a lot along the way, including how to ask better questions, examine our own assumptions, and center equity in policy design. Below, we highlight some of our key takeaways from this work with the hope that they can serve anyone looking to embark on a similar journey.</p>
<h3>Establish shared agreements and trust.</h3>
<p>Our group consisted of 13 people from across the Foundation – representing different programs and departments, varying tenures at Barr, and different identities. It was important for us to figure out how we were going to work together and to create an environment of trust. We started by sharing why each of us cared about this work and volunteered to participate. We also shared a story related to our experiences with the leave policies. By taking the time to share those personal connections to the work, we grew a deeper understanding of where each member was coming from and built trust within the group.</p>

<p>In addition, we took time to establish group norms, many of which were intentionally counter to white dominant culture. We would review the norms at the beginning of each meeting and anchor ourselves in these agreements, such as to “lean into discomfort” and “leave space for constructive silence.” Finally, we identified and rotated key roles for members to play during meetings, including a “questioner” who would help us unpack statements and challenge assumptions. Taking the time to establish trust and agreement on how the work would move forward was fundamental to our group’s success. </p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--time""> <p>the</p> </blockquote></p>
<h3>Make values explicit.</h3>
<p>Quickly, we realized how rare it was for personnel policies to be explicitly grounded in values. Instead, values are absent, buried, or up to the reader to interpret. Many personnel policies (like ours were at the time) are written in legal language that clearly put the organization first.</p>

<p>When examining our policies, we asked: <em>what assumptions and values do we perceive are embedded in the policies, either implicitly or explicitly? How are the policies in alignment or misalignment with the organization’s mission and values?</em> Many of us came up with different answers to these questions, depending on how we experienced the policies and read in between the lines. Our answers also differed from the intent of the policies as expressed by leadership and human resources. This line of inquiry underscored the importance of being explicit. As a result, we created a preamble for each policy, articulating the intent and the core values driving the policy design.</p>

<p>For example, the following is an excerpt of an added preamble introducing the leave policy section within our employee handbook:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Personnel policies described in this handbook aim to support our staff to do their best work on behalf of the organization while simultaneously fostering a workplace that exhibits trust, flexibility, empathy, and care for its employees. It is in that spirit that these policies have been written, with these values at the center.&quot;  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Design for the most marginalized to benefit all.</h3>
<p>To generate our recommendations, we used “universal design theory,” which asserts that policies centering on the experiences of those most marginalized will be more equitable and work for everyone. We asked ourselves: <em>who might be marginalized by each policy; who might benefit from each policy; and how might the policies be experienced differently by different people?</em> We tried to take multiple perspectives with this analysis. We helped each other identify blind spots and play out scenarios that any one of us may have missed. We found that race, gender, class, and positional authority were some of the most prominent differences that made a difference in how people experienced the leave policies. And we found that our policies, while good intentioned, reflected a Western, Christian, patriarchal, heteronormative society. This was apparent in how our policies defined family, what holidays we celebrated, and how we differentiated maternity and paternity leave.</p>
<h3>Engage leadership in the journey.</h3>
<p>Importantly, we had been in open dialogue with leadership throughout our process. It can often be the case that organizations create a task force that independently does a lot of work and presents its recommendations at a high-stakes meeting. This was not that case. Instead, our dialogue with leaders was iterative–more conversation than presentation. This approach facilitated leadership learning alongside our own. It also created a shared understanding of goals for the work, guiding values, and the line of inquiry that led to our policy proposals. Leadership served as an extension of our team, <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/to-advance-racial-equity-foundation-boards-need-to-take-an-active-role"">taking an active role</a>.</p>
<h3>Where we landed (and what’s next).</h3>
<p>In late 2020, we recommended a package of policy changes that were fully embraced by organizational leadership. At one point in that discussion, our board chair observed that we were shifting from protecting the organization to protecting our people. It was affirming to hear that, as balancing the needs of the organization with the needs of the employees was one of our goals for policy design. Our new leave policies underscore trust and flexibility. They aim to provide staff with the time they need to step away from work to take care of themselves, take care of loved ones, and uphold their civic duty.</p>
<h4>Some notable changes include:</h4>
<ul>
<li>An expanded definition of family across our policies; </li>
<li>More flexibility with hours and remote work; </li>
<li>The reframing of sick leave to health leave with an added emphasis on mental health; and </li>
<li>A gender inclusive parental leave policy with added time to bond and care for a child. </li>
</ul>

<p>Like with many task forces, it took time to hit our stride. When the pandemic hit, we made a conscious effort to keep going because we knew these efforts would have an important impact on our organization, both during the pandemic and in the years to come. We&#39;re glad we pushed through and have already begun to see, hear, and experience the important role these policies play in supporting staff to do their best work. </p>

<p>We are grateful for the opportunity to serve and to learn alongside our colleagues through our participation in this action learning task force. And importantly, we are grateful for the opportunity to influence organizational change. We carry the lessons, principles, and values that guided this effort with us in <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/advancing-racial-equity"">our ongoing journey to center equity</a> in our work. We know there&#39;s always more we can do individually and collectively as an organization to reflect, empathize, challenge, and grow. In that spirit, we welcome your feedback, insights, and questions about this work.</p>

828,Ahead of the Heat Wave: Preparing for Extreme Heat in Massachusetts,<p>Explore resources from the Metropolitan Area Planning Council's first Heat Preparedness Week.</p>,"<p>In the Greater Boston region, we&#39;re experiencing more frequent and intense heat waves, as well as generally rising temperatures. 2020 marked the <a href=""https://www.noaa.gov/news/july-2020-was-record-hot-for-n-hemisphere-2nd-hottest-for-planet"">hottest summer globally</a>, with 14 days over 90 degrees in Boston. By the 2030s, scientists predict we could more than double that and have 41 days of 90 degrees due to climate change. In 2021, the first day over 90 degrees already occurred—in May.</p>

<p>Extreme heat is one of the deadliest weather events in the United States and can exacerbate existing health conditions. And the effects aren&#39;t experienced equally: the impacts of extreme heat are greater in low-income neighborhoods and communities of color, where historic disinvestment has resulted in less access to green space, fewer street trees, and inadequate housing and cooling infrastructure. These impacts will only intensify as climate change causes temperatures to increase and humidity to rise.</p>

<p>Members of the public, policymakers, and decision-makers across the region must continue to elevate the urgency and impacts of extreme heat. As our MAPC colleagues shared in a recent <a href=""https://commonwealthmagazine.org/opinion/gearing-up-to-cope-with-extreme-heat/"">Commonwealth Magazine Op-Ed</a>, community-centered planning and decision-making will be critical to protecting the most vulnerable this—and every future—summer.</p>

<p>That’s why the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC), Greater Boston’s regional planning agency, launched the inaugural “Heat Preparedness Week” during the third week of May this year, leading up to the unofficial start of summer: Memorial Day Weekend. Throughout the week, we sought to draw attention to this topic, hosting events and <a href=""https://www.mapc.org/resource-library/extreme-heat/"">highlighting projects</a> across the region that serve to address and reduce extreme heat.</p>

<p>Those projects include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>COVID-Safe Cooling</strong>: MAPC and the Mystic River Watershed Association (MyWRA), with funding from the Barr Foundation, are supporting local cooling projects and educational projects in seven communities most impacted by both COVID-19 and extreme heat: Boston, Brockton, Chelsea, Everett, Lawrence, Lynn, and Revere. Last year’s projects including installing hydration stations, adapting cooling centers for social distancing, distributing personal cooling devices like air conditioners and fans, and electric utility assistance. This program is offering a second round of funding in 2021. </li>
<li><strong><a href=""https://www.mapc.org/resource-library/accelerating-resiliency/"">Accelerating Climate Resiliency</a> (ACR) grant program</strong>: MAPC is working in partnership with the Barr Foundation to accelerate climate resilience in the region by helping municipalities advance strategies that protect people, places, and communities from the impacts of climate change. Many funded projects – including tree-planting initiatives, community education strategies, and climate-smart parks – mitigate or build resilience to extreme heat.<br></li>
<li><strong><a href=""https://www.mapc.org/planning101/grant-opportunity-extreme-heat-preparedness-engagement/"">Metro Mayors Building Resilience to Climate-Driven Heat</a></strong>: The Metro Mayors Climate Taskforce received a Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness Action grant to create a roadmap to collectively address heat-related health concerns and reduce heat islands. </li>
<li><strong>Art for Heat Resilience</strong>: MAPC will work with artists and creatives this summer on extreme heat-related creative communications, creative engagement, and creative cooling infrastructure. Stay tuned: we’re also putting together a toolkit of creative strategies to mitigate and communicate about extreme heat!<br></li>
<li><strong><a href=""https://www.mapc.org/our-work/expertise/clean-energy/peak-demand/"">Peak Demand Management</a></strong>: MAPC runs our own free Peak Electricity Demand Notification program for our municipalities to learn how to reduce demand, costs, and emissions associated with “peak” capacity charges during times of the greatest strain (and dirtiest fuels) on our regional electricity grid.</li>
<li><strong><a href=""https://www.mapc.org/resource-library/keep-cool-somerville/"">Keep Cool Somerville</a></strong>: Last year, we created a toolkit of strategies for long-term summer heat preparedness in Somerville. This year, we’re funding and building capacity for small-scale pilot projects to improve resilience to heat. </li>
</ul>

<p>So, what can you do to learn more and spread the word about climate-driven heat in the region?</p>

827,From Commitment to Action: Barr’s Racial Equity Work,"<p>Barr’s president introduces refreshed core values, recent grant investments, and new website section focused on Barr’s commitment to racial equity.</p>","<p>During the past several years, a frequent refrain from me has been that actions matter more than words. I returned to this theme often in these blog posts during the past year, especially as we watched so many leaders and organizations assert that Black Lives Matter and that we must Stop Asian Hate; commit to addressing structural racism; and express solidarity with those calling for racial justice.</p>

<p>Such statements are important, but they only matter if they yield concrete actions and if those actions are sustained for the long-term.</p>

<p>This blog post returns to this theme, as I report on a number of actions we have taken at Barr as part of our continued and deepened commitment to racial equity. So, yes, actions do matter.</p>

<p>But then, so do words, which is where I begin.</p>
<h3>Updating Barr’s Core Values and Centering Racial Equity</h3>
<p>We recently <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/about#core-values"">refreshed the core values</a> of the Barr Foundation. These values were first codified by our co-founders, in partnership with me, in 2014. Articulating Barr’s core values was especially important then in view of our plans to expand the board and to have a majority of Barr’s board be composed of non-family members, which is where we stand today.</p>

<p>Although it was not explicit in those values, Barr’s founding trustees always viewed equity as an implicit value, woven through Barr’s grantmaking and culture since our inception. However, through our own work on diversity, equity and inclusion, we have learned the importance of both stated and unstated values. And as a result of discussions among our board over the past year, our trustees chose to update these values in 2021.</p>

<p>Barr’s values now include an explicit commitment to center racial equity. They also make a subtle, but important, shift from a value focused on “excellence” to one focused on “impact”. While this may seem a semantic change, at its core is our acknowledgement that excellence can often be confused with perfectionism and can also raise questions such as: excellence according to whose standards? A shift to impact puts the accent where it should be: on our service to community.</p>

<p>We invite you to review <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/about#core-values"">our refreshed values</a> and welcome any feedback, as always.</p>
<h3>New Investments to Advance Racial Equity</h3>
<p>Most of the grant resources we are dedicating as a result of our deepened commitment to racial equity will occur within our core programs. At the same time, we have been selectively investing in organizations that are strengthening the infrastructure for racial equity work in Greater Boston. I highlight three recent grants here:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>$460,000 to the <a href=""https://www.bu.edu/antiracism-center/"">Center for Antiracism Research</a> at Boston University, founded by Dr. Ibram X. Kendi. Barr’s three-year grant will support the Center’s narrative work, which focuses on translating research to practice in accessible ways.</p></li>
<li><p>$450,000 grant to the <a href=""https://www.tbf.org/nonprofits/grant-making-initiatives/latino-equity-fund"">Latino Equity Fund</a> for operating support. This is part of their recently announced $10 million campaign to capitalize the Fund for grantmaking activities; Barr’s support enabled <a href=""https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2021/05/24/latino-equity-fund-names-first-director.html"">the appointment of their first-ever Executive Director, Evelyn Barahona</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>$450,000 grant to the <a href=""https://www.bostonwomensfund.org/"">Boston Women’s Fund</a> for operating support. Our grant comes as Natanja Craig-Oquendo takes the helm of the Fund and as she brings her leadership and vision to its vital work.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These recent grants follow similar investments that Barr has made in the past several months: <a href=""https://kingboston.org/"">King Boston</a> ($1,000,000), the <a href=""https://fbequity.org/"">Foundation for Business Equity</a> ($250,000), the <a href=""https://www.boston.gov/departments/resilience-and-racial-equity"">City of Boston’s Equity Office</a> ($200,000), the <a href=""https://www.tbf.org/donors/forms/new-commonwealth-fund"">New Commonwealth Fund</a> ($175,000), <a href=""https://getkonnected.com/gk-fund#"">GetKonnected Fund</a> ($75,000), and two investments totaling $250,000 in the <a href=""https://kingboston.org/the-forward-fund/"">Forward Fund</a>, managed by King Boston, which awards grants to community-based groups, with grant decisions made by community leaders. In all, these new grants total in excess of $3.3 million.</p>

<p>Every one of these organizations is led by a person of color, and Barr’s investments are a direct manifestation of our core value to invest in leaders, providing them the resources and flexibility to make the decisions that will best serve their organizations and advance their vision.</p>

<p>Finally, we have also made significant investments this year—over $2 million—for <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/barr-commits-2-million-for-vaccine-equity-efforts"">vaccine equity efforts</a>, as I reported earlier this year.</p>

<p>We view all of these investments as a start, as we continue to scan the landscape, consult with community leaders, and identify other ways for Barr to be a supportive partner in this important work. I will have more to share later this year on our further plans.</p>
<h3>A New Home for Storytelling and Transparency About Barr’s Racial Equity Work</h3>
<p>To date, our blog has served as our primary platform for sharing progress on Barr’s work related to racial equity. As our core program areas develop further plans and expand their investments, we will share updates on their progress.</p>

<p>To that end, we recently posted blogs from program directors Mariella Puerto and San San Wong regarding racial equity work in the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/racial-equity-and-barr-s-climate-program"">Climate</a> and <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/racial-equity-and-barr-s-arts-creativity-program"">Arts &amp; Creativity</a> programs respectively. And Leah Hamilton will write about racial equity and the Education Program in the months ahead.</p>

<p>In addition, we have created a new landing page on our website that consolidates much of Barr’s communications, timeline, and strategies related to racial equity. With thanks to our communications team, I am pleased to share this Racial Equity page with you. We will continue to update this page as our work evolves and use it as a platform to increase transparency and accountability.</p>

<p>Much remains to be done to realize our commitment, and yet, with the powerful leadership exhibited by so many at this moment, with a Boston Mayoral election that will result in the first person of color ever elected to that role, and with so many in our field adding their own commitments to ensure this time is indeed different, there is hope and promise of real, sustained change. The work continues—as it must—and we at Barr remain all-in.</p>

825,Racial Equity and Barr’s Arts & Creativity Program ,<p>Program Director San San Wong on why centering racial equity is necessary for achieving Barr’s Arts & Creativity goals.</p>,"<p>2020 was enormously disruptive for the arts. The COVID-19 pandemic and racial justice uprisings revealed deep power and wealth inequities, and vulnerabilities of marginalized communities across society. We saw the tenacity and inventiveness of artists and cultural workers to pivot and create new ways to engage their communities and audiences. Yet, the long-broken business models and exploitive practices in our sector came more fully to light. We saw a wave of high-profile “call-outs,” where arts industries and organizations were publicly challenged by artists, staff members and other constituents to do better, to examine their cultures, complicity, and privilege, and to dismantle practices within their own institutions that reinforce white supremacy. We also saw a more widespread acknowledgement of the historic lack of investment in artists and organizations led by and rooted in Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) communities, and of grantmaking practices that reinforce such inequities.</p>

<p>Through Barr’s Arts &amp; Creativity Program, we have been working to advance racial equity for years, with a focus on increasing diversity and relevancy in the arts in Massachusetts. We believe that communities become dynamic and thriving when their arts and creative expression reflect the full range of cultures, traditions, and voices in those communities. In this post I will describe where we’ve been and where we are headed, acknowledging this is but the first steps toward an urgent need to integrate racial equity more explicitly across our strategies.</p>
<h3>The Evolution of Barr’s Arts &amp; Creativity Program</h3>
<p>The goal of the Barr’s Arts &amp; Creativity program is to: <em>Elevate the arts and enable creative expression to engage and inspire a dynamic, thriving Massachusetts.</em></p>

<p>To advance this goal, Barr’s Arts &amp; Creativity program takes a systemic approach, investing in aspects of the arts sector we believe hold great power for creating large-scale change: visionary leaders and anchor organizations, necessary infrastructure for the arts ecosystem, and leading-edge practices.</p>

<p>When I arrived at Barr in 2012, the Foundation was shifting our grantmaking approach from project grants to multi-year operating support. At the time, Barr was seeking to focus on fewer, larger grants in the belief that those grants could have greater impact with greater efficiency. This shift limited our direct grantmaking to smaller budget organizations and organizations of color. Nonetheless, as Boston is a “majority minority city” and recognizing Boston’s history of racial segregation, we focused on relevancy and increasing diversity and inclusion, and invested in artistic practices that engaged residents and in anchor cultural organizations in neighborhoods like Upham’s Corner and Chinatown. Boston’s cultural plan (supported by Barr and Klarman foundations) had an explicit focus on cultural equity and active participation from all of Boston’s neighborhoods.</p>

<p>We also sought to build support for artists, the critical engines of creativity and cultural expression. To do so, and with a particular focus on artists of color, Barr began forging new partnerships with community foundations and regional and national intermediaries. We sought partners who also value strong relationships with communities and grantees, who shared our priority of systems change, and who could make direct grants and provide customized supports to individual artists and small organizations. Our investments and partnerships have helped catalyze and grow a wide range of BIPOC arts activity, including support for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Artists to create new work and community engaged practices, such as <a href=""https://www.tbf.org/nonprofits/grant-making-initiatives/live-arts-boston"">Live Arts Boston</a>, a partnership with The Boston Foundation, and the <a href=""https://www.nefa.org/CreativeCityBoston"">Creative City Boston</a> and <a href=""https://www.nefa.org/CreateSpatialJustice"">Spatial Justice</a> initiatives, both in partnership with New England Foundation for the Arts;</li>
<li>Equitable community and economic development, such as the <a href=""https://www.massdevelopment.com/what-we-offer/key-initiatives/tdi/tdi-creative-catalyst"">Creative Catalyst Grants</a> in partnership with MassDevelopment’s Transformative Development Initiative, which supports locally initiated, public-facing projects that advance arts- and culture-based economic development and neighborhood revitalization in Gateway Cities; and </li>
<li>Increasing the visibility of artists and communities of color by investing in the rapid growth of WBUR’s <a href=""https://www.wbur.org/artery"">The ARTery</a>, whose leadership has been committed to journalistic integrity, stories reflective of Boston’s diverse communities, and nurturing BIPOC arts reporters.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Centering Racial Equity in Barr’s Arts &amp; Creativity Program</h3>
<p>Over the past year, we have come to see even more clearly that a central focus on racial equity is <em>required</em> to achieve the goal of a dynamic, thriving Commonwealth, with adaptive and relevant organizations with broad public engagement and support. The Foundation’s explicit commitment to racial equity and internal examination of its practices affirm the Arts &amp; Creativity Program’s determination to further racial and cultural equity in the arts in Massachusetts and is allowing us to go deeper.</p>

<p>We are committed to this work for the long term. Building on our current strategies and investments, we envision three expanded areas of work to center racial equity over the next ten years:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Centering BIPOC artists, organizations and communities in our program strategies, including significant new grantmaking.</strong> Primarily through intermediary partners who bring relevant relationships and capacity, we aim to keep expanding support to and engagement with racially and culturally diverse voices, artistic expressions, and communities.</li>
<li><strong>Supporting partners to become increasingly anti-racist, thereby bolstering their adaptive capacity, relevancy, and civic leadership.</strong> We recognize that this is an ongoing journey that requires deep organizational transformation.</li>
<li><strong>Committing to equitable philanthropic practices.</strong> Our current work, including our major initiatives, was designed with trust-based philanthropy practices, including co-designing with grantees, transparency and responsiveness, multi-year unrestricted funding, and support beyond financial resources. Nonetheless, we know that we will need to continue being open to modifying our approach as we expand our knowledge and build deeper relationships within BIPOC arts communities.</li>
</ol>

<p>Working in this way takes time – particularly our commitment to co-design and working in partnership with organizations. However, we also know that BIPOC arts organizations and artists have long been under-resourced and have been hit hard by the pandemic. We have begun ramping up our grantmaking to BIPOC arts organizations and added five new organizations of color to our portfolio early this year through an initial set of short-term relief grants: Elevated Thought (Lawrence), Southeast Asian Coalition of Central Massachusetts (Worcester), The Loop Lab (Cambridge), Angkor Dance Troupe (Lowell) and Art for the Soul Gallery (Springfield). We selected these first five after extensive consultation with partners and colleagues across the state, focusing on characteristics which position them as cultural anchors, such as embeddedness in BIPOC and immigrant communities; strong community activism; authentic, often multi-generational, leadership; demonstrated track record of resiliency and consistency over time; and quality of creative expression. We also joined the Boston Mayor’s Office of Arts and Culture and The Boston Foundation to support <a href=""https://www.boston.gov/news/450000-covid-19-funding-awarded-local-bipoc-arts-organizations"">17 Boston-based arts organizations of color</a> which offer year-round programming and regular opportunities and supports for BIPOC artists to make and show work. We have a unique opportunity to further this progress and double our funding of these priorities through our partnership on Ford Foundation’s America’s Cultural Treasures initiative over the coming five years and will provide further updates in the coming months.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--a""> <p>is</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>And as part of our efforts to accelerate change in the systems surrounding these artists and organizations, we recently renewed our investment in Center for Cultural Innovation’s (CCI) <a href=""https://ambitio-us.org/"">AmbitioUS initiative</a>, which seeks to advance economic justice and the infrastructure necessary to beget thriving cultural centers and tomorrow’s Black and Indigenous Wall Streets. CCI uses various financial tools—grants, loans, and investments—to foster solutions that give artists and cultural communities ownership, power, and economic self-determination. For example, their funding is supporting:</p>

<ul>
<li>a cooperatively owned and governed business of and for African American creative content producers working in the digital realm;</li>
<li>the East Bay Permanent Real Estate Cooperative, which enables Black Oaklanders to collectively own cultural properties; and</li>
<li>The <a href=""https://www.ujimaboston.com/"">Boston Ujima Project</a> which is using cultural strategies to create strong economies for communities of color in the Boston region.</li>
</ul>

<p>To further investigate this line of economic systems change, Barr, Hewlett and Rainin foundations supported Grantmakers in the Arts to explore how the grantmaking community can support culture-workers and artists through an increasingly just economy. Earlier this year, Grantmakers in the Arts released <a href=""https://art.coop/#welcome""><em>Solidarity Not Charity: Arts &amp; Culture Grantmaking in the Solidarity Economy</em></a>, a commissioned report and interactive website that provides an overview of the Solidarity Economy, culture-workers’ role in it, and what grantmakers may do to support it through recommendations and an action checklist.</p>

<p>This is a defining moment for all of us to re-imagine an arts ecosystem that is more just, equitably resourced, and community rooted. We have many questions about how to get there but are determined to do what we can to bring that vision into being. We know that along the way we’ll need to keep listening to, learning from, and adapting alongside our many artist, community and institutional partners.</p>

824,The Critical High School Years,<p>Recent report pinpoints key areas to help students succeed in high school and shows importance of data about students’ post-secondary experiences.</p>,"<p>What does it take to help all students achieve their goals of success in high school and beyond? That is the core question behind a recent report –<a href=""https://www.ey.com/en_us/education/improving-post-secondary-readiness-for-all-students"">“Post-Secondary Success for All: Learnings from an analysis of five school districts”</a> - jointly authored by <a href=""https://www.ey.com/en_us/education"">EY-Parthenon</a> and <a href=""https://www.springpointschools.org/"">Springpoint</a>, and funded by the Barr Foundation. The report identifies common pain points that are contributing to inequitable post-secondary outcomes. It features examples from participating districts of effective strategies for addressing challenges and helping students succeed. And the report demonstrates how important it is to collect and carefully consider data about students’ experiences both in high school and beyond.</p>

<p>The report highlights the critical combination of quantitative and qualitiative data on students experiences in and beyond high school from five school districts that represent a cross section of New England – Hartford Public Schools (CT), Malden Public Schools (MA), Manchester School District (NH), Portland Public Schools (ME), and Worcester Public Schools (MA). EY-Parthenon analyzed data on students who graduated in 2016 to understand their experiences in high school and in post-secondary settings. Springpoint visited a representative sample of high schools in each district to gather qualitative data using a rubric rooted in research-based school design principles and national best practices.</p>

<p>Although these findings date from before the pandemic, we know that the underlying challenges have only been exacerbated over the last year, and the urgency to reimagine our high schools has only grown.</p>

<p>One of the report’s key findings is that the 9th grade year is absolutely critical. Of the students who reach the end of 9th grade with all the credits they need to be on track for graduation, almost three quarters successfully enroll and persist in post-secondary options. Ensuring all students successfully finish 9th grade, not by lowering expectations but by providing targeted supports, is enormously important. Prior to 9th grade, researchers also found early warning indicators in middle school – attendance, suspensions, and test performance – that are highly correlated with future success, and that suggest key moments to help students regain and sustain momentum.</p>

<p>And we know that more can be done to support students to be prepared for post-secondary success even if they come into high school with these middle school early warning signs. Another key research finding is that students – even those within the same district or school – have inconsistent access to academically rigorous and relevant learning experiences. While observing classrooms, Springpoint asked students what connections they saw between their learning and the real world. Many students shared that they didn’t see a connection at all. The team found that rigor and relevance was most evident in advanced coursework options such as Advancement Placement and dual enrollment courses and that participation in these courses increases the likelihood of post-secondary success. However, there was inconsistent participation in advanced coursework based on student profile – for example, Black and Latinx students were up to 60% less likely to be participating in those courses.</p>

<p>The report echoes an important finding that we at Barr and others have also raised: Looking at data through the lenses of race, economic status, special needs, or English proficiency reveals significant gaps in who is able to graduate high school and enroll and persist in any form of higher education.</p>

<p>The report also lifts up examples of effective ways to address the root causes of these inequities. Malden and Hartford are establishing freshman-focused academies and other initiatives that tailor supports to student needs and put them on a path to success. Portland has coupled a “district post-secondary plan,” which outlines post-secondary preparation plans for students in each high school grade level with significant work to enhance post-secondary supports, such as more family engagement around the college application process. Worcester is developing a “portrait of a graduate” to establish a vision for what it means to prepare all students for post-secondary success rather than just focusing on high school graduation. Importantly, all of the districts are working towards meaningful changes in the quality of curriculum and instruction as a key driver of more equitable post-secondary outcomes.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--need""> <p>schools</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>We need to recognize the more fundamental insight from this analysis – we wouldn&#39;t know any of this if we didn&#39;t look at student data consistently, from a range of sources, and across the long-term. It is our job to know how our students are doing both while they are in high school and after they leave. Understanding that and how we contribute to those results is an essential responsibility in our work, and a critical piece for informing how we need to remake the high school experience.</p>

<p>High schools need to change, and high schools can change. The pandemic created new challenges, but it also cast in sharp relief the gaps and challenges that have been there all along. We must not return to the way things were – including letting ourselves think it’s ever too late to invest in students. The high school years are critical years that can alter the trajectory of their lives. We need to reimagine high schools to connect all students to success.</p>

823,Racial Equity and Barr’s Climate Program,<p>Director Mariella Puerto shares how Barr’s Climate Program is centering racial equity in its work.</p>,"<p>As we’ve shared <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/categories/racial-equity"">here on our blog</a>, Barr has been working to deepen our understanding of racial equity and its implications for our work. In this post, I share how Barr&#39;s <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/climate"">Climate Program</a> has been exploring these ideas and where it is leading us. We are by no means finished with this vital work and still have much to learn. Yet, we are committed to being transparent along the way and always welcome feedback to improve our work.</p>
<h3>Connecting Racial Equity and Climate</h3>
<p>Barr’s Climate Team began this work in earnest in summer 2019. Our initial step was to hear from those closest to the work—our grantees—and to ask them about their experiences and aspirations related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). We learned their experiences varied widely. We also heard important feedback that communications from our Climate Program have been neither clear nor consistent about the Foundation’s commitment to DEI and racial equity.</p>

<p>Based on this feedback, our next step was to develop our own knowledge and skills as a Climate Team. We developed a shared understanding of the multiple levels of racism, examined how we define effectiveness and impact, and understood more deeply how philanthropy perpetuates racial inequities. This learning included two listening sessions with grantees whose work is deeply rooted in racial equity. We learned a lot: in particular, we gained new appreciation of the outsized influence of some of the largest, most well-funded, and longstanding climate organizations, and how Barr could do more to center 1) communities that are most burdened by climate impacts and 2) grantees whose work is explicitly focused on racial equity and climate justice.</p>
<h3>Racial Equity is Essential to Address Climate Change</h3>
<p>Building on this learning, we wanted to be explicit about why we believe racial equity matters in addressing the climate crisis. Three core assumptions provide our starting point:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The fossil fuel economy degrades our climate and harms people. This economy has been enabled by laws, policies, and practices that impose heavy burdens on communities of color and divested communities and creates barriers to access benefits of climate action. We believe we cannot effectively address the climate crisis without addressing this systemic environmental racism.</p></li>
<li><p>We must prioritize communities that have been harmed most by the fossil fuel economy and have contributed least to the climate crisis. Doing so will create a stronger, more inclusive climate movement that elevates the voices and solutions needed to achieve climate goals, while also providing public health and economic benefits to all.</p></li>
<li><p>Equitable solutions achieve greenhouse gas reduction and climate resilience strategies while also improving the health and well-being of divested communities and people of color. </p></li>
</ol>
<h3>New Approaches in Our Grantmaking</h3>
<p>Our Climate Program goal remains unchanged - <em>To address climate change by advancing equitable solutions for clean energy, mobility, and resilient communities.</em> Our grantmaking is still organized into the same three strategies:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Clean Energy:</strong> Transform the Northeast energy system by accelerating the shift to an equitable, clean, efficient, and modern energy system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mobility:</strong> Reduce transportation-related emissions by modernizing our transportation system and accelerating the development of low-carbon communities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Climate Resilience:</strong> Increase the capacity of Metro Boston’s residents, the public sector, private sector, and vulnerable communities to prepare for and adapt to the impacts of climate change.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Yet, a deeper understanding of how racism manifests in our sector led us to five new approaches we will integrate in our grantmaking, to bring greater definition to how we are advancing equitable solutions. These have been endorsed by our trustees as central to achieving both our climate goals and our aspirations for racial equity:</p>

<ul>
<li>Building leadership and organizational capacity of equity-centered climate organizations to grow their power and shape the climate field.<br></li>
<li>Investing in equity-centered, community-based organizations that are linking climate change to other priority issues for communities and fostering greater community engagement and voice in the climate field.<br></li>
<li>Providing career pathways for people of color to enter the climate field.<br></li>
<li>Building capacity in the public sector to implement policies focused on racial equity.<br></li>
<li>Developing capacity of legacy climate organizations to integrate racial equity and anti-racism into their culture and processes, and to implement strategies that advance equitable outcomes.<br></li>
</ul>

<p>We believe these approaches will help us achieve our climate goals and will also: foster stronger support for organizations led by and/or serving communities of color and divested communities, spur our field to consider public health and economic opportunity as critical metrics of success, and dismantle racist policies and practices.</p>
<h3>What will change for grantees and grant seekers?</h3>
<p>Reading this, nonprofit leaders may wonder, “What does this mean for me?” “What will change in my relationship with Barr?” Certainly, we expect these new approaches to lead us to invest in new partners, as well as existing partners in new ways. In time, we are committed to share publicly about progress we’re making towards increasing our investments in equity-centered, community-based organizations led by people of color (and also how we&#39;re defining such terms). The Climate Team’s conversations with current and new partners will now also include questions like: </p>

<ul>
<li>How do we drive down emissions while at the same time supporting racial and economic justice? </li>
<li>Who benefits from and who is most burdened by the policies or projects we are advancing?   </li>
<li>What are the power dynamics at play, for example, who is engaged in decision making and how are decisions being made?   </li>
<li>How do we create strong multiracial coalitions that value the leadership of communities of color? </li>
<li>What do grassroots organizations and leaders of color working on climate change need in order to be successful and what needs to change meet those needs? </li>
</ul>
<h3>A Continuing Journey</h3>
<p>We know this is long-term work and that we will continue to learn from and with partners who share our commitment to build a more diverse, inclusive, and effective climate movement – one that centers communities that are most impacted and that advances equitable solutions.</p>

<p>As we dedicate more resources to integrating racial equity in our program, we hope what we do and how we do it model a visible, meaningful, tangible shift towards equity and anti-racism for the climate field and for philanthropy. We are determined to support communities of color and divested communities most impacted by climate change, so they are engaged, shaping the solutions, and enjoying the benefits of those solutions.</p>"
822,"Regardless of What Happens, Structural Racism Persists",<p>Awaiting a verdict in the Chauvin trial.</p>,"<p>It is likely that a verdict in the Derek Chauvin trial will be rendered in the days ahead. And it will come against the backdrop of the events involving Daunte Wright, Caron Nazario, and Adam Toledo, names we learned in the past few weeks as we have witnessed the violence and injustices directed at each of them.</p>

<p>We could wait for the verdict to issue a statement, such as those I have written <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/we-must-all-speak-out"">post-Charlottesville</a>, following the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/we-all-must-stand-up"">massacre in Pittsburgh</a>, after the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/actions-words"">George Floyd murder</a>, and in the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/we-should-not-be-surprised"">aftermath of this January’s insurrection</a>, among too many other times where our collective rage demanded we speak out.</p>

<p>We often react to seminal moments such as the Chauvin trial verdict, using them as a prompt to raise our voice, to speak to our values, and to compel us to action.</p>

<p>And yet.</p>

<p>The work of anti-racism demands that we act, not just react. The harsh reality is that regardless of the outcome of <em>this</em> particular trial, we know with certainty that the rate of murders of Black and Brown citizens at the hands of law enforcement remains appallingly high. We also know that the systemic racism inherent in our systems of policing and criminal justice do not serve us equitably.</p>

<p>Indeed, as <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/17/us/police-shootings-killings.html"">reported this week in the New York Times</a>, since the testimony in the Chauvin trial commenced on March 29, “at least 64 people have died at the hands of law enforcement nationwide, with Black and Latino people representing more than half of the dead.”</p>

<p>Add to this the <a href=""https://stopaapihate.org/2020-2021-national-report/"">alarming rise in anti-Asian hate</a>, the <a href=""https://www.aclu.org/legislation-affecting-lgbt-rights-across-country"">blatant transphobia</a> playing itself out in statehouses around the country, and the many other explicit, and subtle, ways that racism, anti-Blackness, misogyny, and anti-LGBTQ sentiment present in our society daily.</p>

<p>The verdict will neither change these facts nor the underlying realities that create them. Our work to combat anti-Blackness, to address structural racism, and to strive for equity will—and must—persist.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--to""> <p>work</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>In speaking with several community leaders and friends from the Black community, I have heard a mixture of sadness, anxiety, and rage as the trial has unfolded. As the verdict nears, we must support one another, by providing space for people to give voice to their emotions and feelings, by allowing that expression that to occur without judgment or counter-argument, and by permitting this sadness, anxiety, and rage to be expressed.</p>

<p>Last fall, Barr supported <a href=""https://kingboston.org/"">King Boston</a> to create the <a href=""https://kingboston.org/the-forward-fund/"">Forward Fund</a>, a flexible grantmaking fund to support BIPOC-led community organizations and grassroots efforts, created in anticipation of possible post-election crisis. Fortunately, those funds did not need to be deployed, but as this trial draws to its conclusion, King Boston plans to support a range of activities to create community space for listening, dialogue, healing, and support. We are augmenting our grant to ensure this vital work is well-supported.</p>

<p>And so, we will not wait for a verdict to grant us permission to speak a few of the truths that persist regardless of what happens:</p>

<p><em>Black lives matter, regardless of what happens.</em></p>

<p><em>Systemic racism must be combatted, each and every day, regardless of what happens.</em></p>

<p><em>Barr remains dedicated to the cause of racial equity—for the long-term—regardless of what happens.</em></p>

<p>Indeed, regardless of what happens, let’s be sure to care for one another in the days and weeks ahead. We will need each other’s support, compassion, and, yes, love.</p>"
821,What Do Students Have to Say about Learning and School During COVID-19?,<p>Kate Dobin shares findings from a recent poll on the experiences of high school students throughout the pandemic.</p>,"<p>Students know best whether schools are meeting their needs and preparing them for what comes next in their lives. It is always important to ask them, especially during this moment of massive disruption to their learning.</p>

<p>At the Barr Foundation, we have been working with high schools across New England for many years. Most of our partner schools are traditional district schools and school systems, though Barr supports other types of public schools, such as charter, pilot and innovation schools as well. Even before the pandemic, we knew there was a fair degree of dissatisfaction with high school. To better understand the depth and extent of concerns we were hearing anecdotally from students and educators at our partner schools, we commissioned <a href=""https://barrfdn.issuelab.org/resource/distance-and-disruption-listening-to-massachusetts-students-during-covid-19.html"">Gallup to conduct a poll</a>. From November to December 2020, Gallup surveyed 1,000 Massachusetts high school students, ages 14 to 18, about what they were experiencing. Respondents included students of various races, zip codes and backgrounds, with 80 percent attending district public schools, 16 percent private schools and 4 percent charter public schools.</p>

<p>Across these student groups and school types, what we heard was concerning. Many high school students report feeling behind academically and disengaged from teachers, peers and coursework. Growing numbers say they do not feel prepared for life after graduation.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--also""> <p>survey</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>These feelings did not start with the pandemic, and these student perspectives are full of important lessons we would do well to heed as more schools return to in-person learning, and as all schools consider ways they can and must change to better meet the needs of all their students long term.</p>

<p>Comparing results of students learning entirely remotely, in person or in a hybrid model, Gallup’s survey found that those learning entirely remotely report feeling the most behind and most dissatisfied. Remote-learning students report they are struggling to keep up, with 36 percent saying they are falling behind in their learning this year. Among low-income students learning remotely, that figure climbs to 46 percent. The situation is only slightly better for students in hybrid arrangements, with 31 percent saying they are falling behind. For comparison, consider that only 8 percent of students learning full-time in-person this year say they are falling behind. Thirty-four percent of students in full-time remote learning are very or somewhat dissatisfied with school this year, compared with only 10 percent of those learning in person.</p>

<p>The survey also revealed stark inequities based on race and income. Only 6 percent of students in Massachusetts reported learning full-time in-person (69 percent attending private schools). The rest were attending fully remote, or a hybrid of in-person and remote. Students identifying as Black and Hispanic in the survey were the most likely to be learning entirely remotely. Thirty-one percent of white students are learning remotely full time, compared with 58 percent of black students and 55 percent of Hispanic students. Students from the lowest-income households, making under $60,000, are far more likely to be learning remotely full-time (57 percent) than those in middle-income (37 percent) and upper-income households (31 percent).</p>

<p><img src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3533/original.png?1618425203"" alt=""Figure 1""></p>

<p>And yet, those students most likely to be learning remotely full-time are the same students who are least likely to have reliable internet: 77 percent of white students reported having access to reliable internet, compared with 59 percent of Black students and 58 percent of Hispanic students. There was also a gap among income levels, with 25 percent fewer students living in households with incomes under $60,000 saying they have high-speed internet (59 percent) than those living in households making more than $120,000 per year (84 percent).</p>

<p>The survey also found that high school students are deeply unsatisfied with their school experience this year. But they were not very satisfied before the pandemic, either. Today, only 18 percent feel they learn a lot every day, but only 31 percent felt that way last year. Today, only 17 percent are excited about what they are learning in school, but only 23 percent felt that way last year.</p>

<p><img src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3534/original.png?1618425236"" alt=""Figure 1""> </p>

<p>Perhaps even more troubling – large majorities of high school students say they do not feel prepared for life after high school. Only 27 percent of high school students feel the schoolwork they get is preparing them to succeed. Among 11th- and 12th-grade students learning remotely full-time this year, 46 percent report that their school is not doing enough to prepare them to succeed after graduation.</p>

<p>High school is failing too many students. COVID-19 has added new challenges and exposed deep gaps that were there well before the pandemic upended our world. These students have made that clear, and we have a responsibility to listen and do something about it.</p>

<p>It is our sincere hope that the lessons learned during this catastrophic year lay the groundwork for significant change – to bring students not only back into their school buildings, but forward into new, more rigorous, engaging, relevant, personalized, student-centered high school experiences.</p>

820,How We’re Reshaping Our Employee Reviews To Be More Equitable,"<p>Reflections from a cross-functional team bringing a diversity, equity, and inclusion lens to how we work.</p>","<p><em>Pictured above: Barr staff on retreat in East Boston, 2018.</em></p>

<p>For several years, the Barr Foundation has been on <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/barr-equity-journey"">a journey to center equity</a> in all we do, from our grantmaking to our organizational practices. We know that in order to fulfill our mission to invest in potential, our internal processes need to be aligned with our values of embracing diversity, equity, and inclusion, and intentionally designed to embed racial equity.</p>

<p>Through staff engagement, we identified Barr’s performance review process as one important area to explore and improve. We assembled an “action learning team,” representing staff from across the organization and, with a goal to “<strong>B</strong>uild <strong>A</strong> <strong>R</strong>eally <strong>R</strong>eliable, <strong>C</strong>onsistent, <strong>A</strong>nd <strong>T</strong>ransparent <strong>S</strong>ystem” for performance evaluation at Barr we named ourselves the “<strong>Barr Cats</strong>.” We are three members of that nine-person team, offering a few reflections on what we did and what we learned, with the hope this can be helpful to others. We welcome your feedback and ideas.</p>
<h3>Notice and question old habits.</h3>
<p>When we got started, our group’s first impulse was to hire an outside expert to research and find a solution. Let’s find the best practice and put it in place, we thought! But, with guidance from one of our DEI consultants, Parisa Parsa, we realized this was a classic “minimization” tactic. As part of Barr’s equity journey, we all took the “Intercultural Developmental Inventory” (IDI) - an assessment for individuals and organizations to understand their own thinking and behaviors, and to guide learning and action towards becoming more diverse, inclusive, and equitable. A common behavior in the “minimization” stage of the IDI is a rush to the right answer, policy, or practice – without fully understanding or addressing underlying issues.</p>

<p>It felt uncomfortable to break with old habits and our usual urgency. Yet, we all came to see the importance of valuing the process as much as the final outcome – in order for that final outcome to be truly more equitable.</p>
<h3>Listen and learn.</h3>
<p>Putting our sense of urgency aside, rather than starting with a complete overhaul of our performance review system, we set out to listen and learn. We started by interviewing individual leaders at Barr who had shaped the performance review process over the years, in order to deeply understand the history and how we evolved to where we are today. We had conversations with other organizations as well as our own colleagues, actively seeking their feedback and ideas. One way we engaged staff was with a simple survey about our annual performance reviews. We asked just two questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What do you think a successful performance review process should provide you with?</li>
<li>What do you need to feel supported as you go through the performance review process?</li>
</ul>

<p>There were seven clear themes that staff wanted to see better incorporated in performance reviews:</p>

<ol>
<li>Emphasizing dialogue </li>
<li>Taking into account multiple perspectives </li>
<li>Making sure the annual review is part of a more regular conversation </li>
<li>Situating the individual’s goals in the broader context of the team and foundation’s work </li>
<li>Identifying areas for improvement along with a plan for addressing them </li>
<li>Acknowledging contributions and successes </li>
<li>Collaborating with supervisor to set goals</li>
</ol>
<h3>Pilot and iterate.</h3>
<p>Rather than trying to wrap all of these ideas into a perfect, polished, comprehensive plan (as we might have done in the past), we shared these themes with our colleagues and encouraged them to experiment during the next performance review process. We then surveyed staff again to ask if they had tried any new approaches and, if so, what they did and the impact it had on their experience. Their responses informed our ultimate proposal.</p>

<p>One example of a pilot was around the approach to compensation decisions. While individual compensation was not part of the Barr Cats’ scope of work, staff surveys revealed a clear desire for more transparency about the connection between performance review and compensation decisions. In response, our team asked Barr’s president and vice president to host a brown bag lunch, where they explained the approach to compensation decisions and addressed staff questions. We recorded the session and made it available to staff who weren’t able to join in person. One result of this dialogue is that the annual compensation letters staff receive now include the salary range associated with their position and an explanation for how to interpret the range.</p>
<h3>Commit to action and accountability (and to more learning and improving).</h3>
<p>As a final step for this phase of the Barr Cats work, we recommended action steps aligned to four key objectives:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a clear, transparent process that supports the growth and learning of all staff by linking performance review with skill development and career advancement.</li>
<li>Create a mechanism that enables ongoing monitoring and assessment of the process. </li>
<li>Make recommendations on the information, processes, and support provided and available to staff related to their own career and personal journey within and external to Barr.</li>
<li>Identify DEI practices and tools that can be used to inform the compensation decision process.</li>
</ol>

<p>We shared these recommendations first with Barr’s leadership team and then with all of our colleagues. The collective work to put them into action is now underway. As one example, we’ve reframed our annual review as a “reflection” to emphasize learning, skill development, and professional growth, and have piloted a simple, <a href=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/443/attachments/Annual_Performance_Review_%28Reflection%29_Form.doc?1618408133"">straightforward framework</a> to facilitate those conversations.</p>

<p>To support and advise on the work ahead, and on future opportunities to learn and refine our approach, the Barr Cats will call for volunteers among our colleagues to form a successor group (we suggested, but did not require, that they call themselves the “Barr Kittens”). Working closely with our Vice President for Administration, who oversees talent development, this group will track the ongoing implementation of the recommendations, gather feedback from staff, and refine it based on what they hear.</p>

<p>We feel proud of the results of our work – yet, in some ways even more proud and grateful for how we got there, and all we learned along the way. Working with a diverse, cross-functional team in such a collaborative way, informed at each step by voices and perspectives from across our organization was meaningful and rewarding for each of us. </p>

<p>We will continue to share as Barr explores other areas of internal culture and process toward our goal of being actively anti-racist. In the next few weeks, our colleagues on Barr&#39;s second action learning team–the &quot;BarrTenders&quot;–will share reflections on their work to bring a DEI lens to our leave policies.</p>"
818,Barr Extends Timeline for 2019 Fellows,"<p>Adapting to COVID-19, Barr extends timeline for 2019 Barr Fellows.</p>","<p>The Barr Fellowship celebrates and supports a network of civic leaders committed to Greater Boston. Since 2005, Barr has generally named a new class of Barr Fellows every other year. The most recent class of Barr Fellows was <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/announcing-the-2019-class-of-barr-fellows"">announced in June 2019</a>. Given the impact of COVID-19, Barr has decided to defer the selection of our next class of Barr Fellows.</p>

<p>The Class of 2019 was ready to embark on their Learning Journey to Jordan in March 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic brought much of the world to a halt. A ten-day trip outside of the U.S. is a unique element of the Barr Fellowship, designed to strengthen relationships and foster shared learning among Fellows. This journey and other experiences core to the Fellowship (such as in-person retreats and three-month sabbaticals), have all been deferred for the 2019 Class.</p>

<p>We remain committed to providing the full Fellowship experience for them and future classes. This commitment means providing the 2019 Fellows their learning journey when it is safe to do so and supporting these leaders and their organizations when the Fellows take their sabbaticals.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Fellows and their organizations continue to manage increased demands as they have stepped in to help children, families and communities – those that have most often been marginalized and underserved by systems that don’t meet their needs – to weather the current crisis.  The monthly virtual convenings facilitated by Barr’s programmatic partners at <a href=""https://interactioninstitute.org/"">Interaction Institute for Social Change</a> provide opportunities for real-time peer coaching and support as Fellows navigate financial pressures and transitions in service, support their teams and their own personal care, and envision new ways of being and operating in the future.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--leaders""> <p>in</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Investing in leaders is a core value of the Barr Foundation, and we remain committed to supporting a diverse group of effective, visionary, and collaborative leaders through the Fellowship for years to come. We look forward to sharing more about the 2019 Class experience as it evolves.</p>

<p>Looking ahead it&#39;s helpful to note that Barr will not extend a traditional selection process beyond the class of 2019. Given our rapidly changing world context, we’ve decided to take a brief pause to better understand the significant challenges leaders are managing and how Barr can be helpful. We do anticipate sharing more information in the months ahead.</p>

782,Charting a Path Back to Live Performance,<p>Introducing the “Roadmap for Recovery and Resilience for Theater” from the American Repertory Theater and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.</p>,"<p><em>Photo: Boston Circus Guild’s Keep the Light On, presented as part of the A.R.T.’s Virtually OBERON series.</em></p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has forced theaters around the world to shut their doors and face existential questions about the future. Theaters are asking how to safely reopen and how to responsibly welcome back audiences when it is safe to do so. In response to these questions, the American Repertory Theater has embarked on a unique collaboration with the Healthy Buildings Program at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The resulting <a href=""https://americanrepertorytheater.org/roadmap-for-recovery-and-resilience-for-theater/"">“Roadmap for Recovery and Resilience for Theater”</a> is a living document focused specifically on COVID-19 safety for artists, audiences, staff, and performance venues. Three editions of the Roadmap have been published so far, with the most recent edition released in early February 2021.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--is""> <p>Roadmap</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>The Roadmap distills essential questions that theaters are facing in this moment and addresses specific challenges including facilities, administration, rehearsal and production, audience, and pivoting to new models (such as outdoor and digital performances). There is also a section charting the latest developments in testing, vaccines, therapeutics, and new variants. While each theater must address the needs of their own different spaces and communities, the Roadmap also documents the A.R.T.’s own projects throughout the course of the pandemic. With its physical venues closed to the public in keeping with Massachusetts and Harvard guidelines, the A.R.T. is piloting a series of digital performances, as well as many different opportunities for audiences to engage virtually with A.R.T. artists and staff. In spring 2021, audiences are invited to experience digital performances including <a href=""https://americanrepertorytheater.org/shows-events/the-conjurors-club/"">The Conjurors’ Club</a> and <a href=""https://americanrepertorytheater.org/shows-events/hype-man-2021/"">Hype Man</a> (presented in collaboration with Company One Theatre), as well as ongoing <a href=""https://americanrepertorytheater.org/shows-events/?seasonid=47963"">discussion series</a> featuring A.R.T. artists.</p>

<p>The Roadmap also documents several ways that the events of the past year might be viewed as an opportunity for a necessary reset and reimagining. As part of its ongoing commitment to public health in its practices and programming, the A.R.T. recognizes that racism in America constitutes a public health crisis, and a central part of the A.R.T.’s recovery from the pandemic is becoming an anti-racist and anti-oppressive organization. The A.R.T. is tracking these efforts in <a href=""https://americanrepertorytheater.org/about-us/anti-racism-accountability/"">quarterly reports</a> published on the theater’s website.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--the""> <p>of</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Released on February 1, 2021, the third edition of the Roadmap features extensive updates to the Facilities and Developments to Watch sections, including new information about vehicle use, instruments, singing, and portable air cleaners. The A.R.T. is also beginning to imagine in-person projects that still allow audiences to observe physical distancing and mask-wearing, including a work in development at the Arnold Arboretum in Jamaica Plain.

780,A Time for Bold Action on Climate ,"<p>Amos Hostetter, Barr’s Co-Founder and Trustee, reflects on more than a decade of climate philanthropy.</p>","<p>I am generally disinclined to write about our work at the Barr Foundation, as I have always believed that actions speak much louder than words.</p>

<p>And yet, this is an important moment for those of us engaged in climate action. At Barr, the environment was a priority since our inception, but in 2010, we decided to focus on climate change and to make our largest public commitment ($50 million over 5 years at the time). This decision coincided with Barr’s departure from being an anonymous grantmaker, given the urgency of the challenge and a recognition that speaking up about what’s important can help make a difference too.</p>

<p>As I write this, the United States has rejoined the Paris Climate Accords. President Biden has appointed Eric Lander the first-ever cabinet-level science advisor and has also appointed two longtime climate leaders and allies from our own state—John Kerry and Gina McCarthy—to critical leadership roles. The administration has named climate change among our nation’s most urgent priorities – along with the need to address COVID-19, a battered economy, and racial equity. </p>

<p>The President has also directed agencies across the federal government to prioritize climate investments in low-income and communities of color that have traditionally borne the brunt of pollution. Closer to home, in Massachusetts, the most ambitious climate legislation in more than a decade was passed in the legislature calling for net zero emissions by 2050. It too has strong environmental justice protections.</p>

<p>We are pleased to continue in this vital work, now committing more than $30 million annually to three priority areas in Climate – <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/climate/clean-energy"">Clean Energy</a>, <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/climate/mobility"">Mobility</a>, and <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/climate/climate-resilience"">Resilience</a>. I wanted to share a few personal thoughts about why this matters now more than ever:</p>
<h3>We owe it to our children.</h3>
<p>Why focus on climate in the first place? For myself and my family, it started with our being parents (and now grandparents) and with that question parents in every generation ask: “Will we leave a better world than the one we inherited?” </p>

<p>Unfortunately, until now, the answer from our generation has been, “No.” </p>

<p>Runaway climate change ranks among the most damning evidence. So does the inequity in who is suffering.</p>
<h3>We know it’s past time to take bold steps.</h3>
<p>A lot has been accomplished since we got started. In Boston, the work of the <a href=""https://www.greenribboncommission.org/"">Green Ribbon Commission</a> (GRC) has been a big factor. In 2007, Boston developed its first <a href=""https://www.boston.gov/departments/environment/boston-climate-action"">Climate Action Plan</a> (Barr invested significantly in the community engagement aspects of that plan). One of its recommendations was to create a commission of business and community leaders to oversee implementation. That’s how the GRC was born.</p>

<p>Mayor Tom Menino worked to build a diverse leadership group. Ultimately, we gathered 35 business, institutional, and civic leaders, whose collective influence could drive and sustain bold progress over the long haul – no matter who was in the Mayor’s office.</p>

<p>With two major studies supported by the GRC - <a href=""https://www.greenribboncommission.org/document/climate-ready-boston-report/"">Climate Ready Boston</a> and <a href=""https://www.greenribboncommission.org/work/carbon-free-boston/"">Carbon Free Boston</a> – we now have the data and analysis for what needs to be done. And the steps are clear both for reducing emissions and making Boston more resilient – while remaining attentive to equity.</p>

<p>But the clock is ticking.</p>
<h3>We can address climate and strengthen our economy at the same time.</h3>
<p>We’ve got an opportunity to completely break our dependence on fossil fuels. In just ten years, coal-use has disappeared in this region. When we started, coal was around five cents a kilowatt hour, and solar and wind were roughly double that. Now clean energy is the least expensive form of energy, and the cost curves are only going to keep coming down. </p>

<p>In the next few years, the majority of new cars will be electric. Volvo has stopped producing cars with gas-burning engines. GM just pledged to phase theirs out too.</p>

<p>Fracked gas had its champions. When the cost calculus was less favorable for solar and wind, fracked gas billed itself as “natural” and as a “bridge” to real clean energy. Now, it’s clear there’s no need for a bridge – especially one as environmentally destructive as fracked gas. The bold, smart, and best step for our economy and the environment is to leave all fossil fuels behind - including gas.</p>
<h3>We must commit to centering equity in this work.</h3>
<p>At a recent GRC meeting, Chris Cook, Chief of Environment, Energy, and Open Space for the City of Boston observed, “Climate change is not about things, it is all about people.” That’s why racial equity is such a vital consideration in climate work: People are suffering because of climate – and not at all equally. Just look at the devastating and disproportionate toll of COVID-19 on communities already compromised by air and water fouled by fossil fuel pollution. There are challenges with climate, racial equity, and public health – and they can’t be tackled successfully in separate silos. </p>

<p>At the Barr Foundation, we have expressed <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/an-enduring-commitment-to-racial-equity"">our commitment to racial equity</a>, and our actions must now match those words. This is a moment for us to recommit and indeed enhance our efforts to make the world a better, healthier, and more equitable place for future generations.</p>"
779,Creating a More Equitable High School Experience Requires Whole School Change,"<p>Supporting all students to succeed requires much more than a stand-alone racial equity training, program, or role.</p>","<p>Malden, a city just north of Boston, is a diverse community with many racial and socioeconomic groups. The city’s school system relies on data to understand who is being served well — and who is not. Leaning in to difficult conversations about the data served as a foundation for a broad range of next steps the school and district could take toward ensuring that every student has a high-quality learning experience.</p>

<p>Now more than ever, schools and districts across the country are striving to focus on equity, with the challenging events of 2020 illuminating countless disparities across the country. People of color and lower-income communities have experienced significantly higher rates of Covid-19 infection and mortality, along with job loss, housing instability and more precarious food access.</p>

<p>The impact on students and their education experience is profound.  McKinsey &amp; Company predicted that if school closures and hybrid schedules continue throughout this school year, Black students could experience <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/covid-19-and-student-learning-in-the-united-states-the-hurt-could-last-a-lifetime"">10.3 months of learning loss</a> and Latinx students 9.2 months — compared with six months of learning loss for white students.</p>

<p>Such disparities are reinvigorating calls for public education to fulfill its central role in advancing racial equity. Racial equity in education means all young people, regardless of race or background, achieve at high levels. That is the ultimate measure of school quality.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--in""> <p>equity</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>When we see persistent differences in student outcomes based on race and background, this gives us important information; it tells us our schools are falling short — and that we need to do school differently.</p>

<p>As Malden and other thoughtful public districts demonstrate, advancing racial equity takes more than isolated trainings, readings or work by “equity teams.” It takes a commitment to bold thinking about all aspects of school that contribute to school quality.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--equity""> <p>racial</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>This is precisely the work our organizations — the Barr Foundation and <a href=""https://www.springpointschools.org/"">Springpoint</a> — have been doing in our support of  schools across New England,  via  the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/education/engage-new-england"">“Engage New England: Doing high school differently”</a> initiative. Since 2017, schools have designed a diverse array of high school models that champion success for all students. This helps us identify four critical elements linking school quality to racial equity.</p>
<h3>1. A Mission Rooted in the Belief That All Students Can Achieve at High Levels</h3>
<p>Schools that effectively serve all students have a clearly defined mission rooted in an unwavering belief in the potential of all students. The whole school community ​addresses practices, systems or aspects of its culture that do not foster equity.</p>
<h3>2. Challenging and Meaningful Learning Experiences for All Students</h3>
<p>Such schools provide all students with challenging and meaningful learning opportunities, and ensure that students are supported in rigorous and relevant learning experiences preparing them to succeed in a broad range of college and career options.</p>
<h3>3. Customized, Varied, and Accessible Student Supports</h3>
<p>Student support systems, tailored to varied needs, help create and sustain a culture of high expectations. These systems are transparent and easily accessible. Students receive personalized, ongoing feedback on their academic progress and can expect timely and responsive supports — either academic or social-emotional supports as needed.</p>
<h3>4. Data Practices that Measure What Matters and Inform Strategies to Better Serve All Students</h3>
<p>Gathering and studying data helps both groups of students and individuals succeed. Schools need to regularly measure student academic progress and disaggregate data based on race to identify barriers and redesign approaches to better support racial equity. Students of color, English language learners and students receiving special education services are disproportionately enrolled in remedial, below-grade-level coursework that data shows is a dead end for students, and an ineffective strategy for closing learning gaps.</p>

<p>All students deserve a school where they are known, challenged and supported to be ready for a wide variety of personal, education and career options throughout their lives.</p>

<p>It will take an incredible amount of reflection, vulnerability and effort. We have seen how an unwavering focus on students and a willingness to have hard conversations can strengthen school quality and racial equity so that all students, regardless of their race or background, can pursue their goals.</p>

778,Seven Questions with Barr's Senior Program Officer for Arts & Creativity,"<p>Giles Li, our Senior Program Officer for Arts & Creativity, discusses his priorities at Barr, the transition from grantee to grantmaker, and the challenges facing the arts sector throughout COVID-19.</p>","<h3>1. You started at Barr in February 2020, and just a few weeks later, we closed our offices for COVID-19. What was that like?</h3>
<p>I had complicated feelings about it. I was so appreciative to the Foundation leadership for clearly communicating from the very beginning that we should prioritize the health and safety of ourselves and our loved ones. At the same time, I also felt regret for no longer being at a community-based organization in Chinatown - a neighborhood that was bearing the early brunt of not only the pandemic, but of the racist invective of our society and national leaders. After so many years defining myself as a community servant for the region’s immigrant community, it was tough to wholeheartedly embrace my new role at Barr during a period when my friends in the community were struggling with those acute challenges.</p>

<p>But I have been inspired to see Chinatown&#39;s resilience through it all, and of course, I was not surprised. The working class Chinese immigrant community - like just about every community of people who have been marginalized by our society - has a deep history of pulling together during the hardest times to protect, support, and empower one another.</p>

<p>And I was also proud to be at the Foundation as it made a series of relief grants to support immigrant and Black-led organizations early on in this period. It reaffirmed to me that I was at the right place, that had values that aligned with mine.</p>
<h3>2. These months have been enormously challenging for the arts. What have you been seeing and hearing?</h3>
<p>Many arts organizations have had to reimagine their vision for the future. Their staff may now be smaller. Shows and productions have shifted to distanced or online audiences. Smaller organizations and BIPOC-led organizations are at most risk in challenging times, and that feels as intense now as ever.</p>

<p>We have also been hearing from artists who lost income and opportunity almost overnight, and have no idea when they’ll be able to just earn a living again. This is forcing some to leave the arts sector altogether, which could have dire consequences for the future. We can’t have a future in which only rich people can afford to pursue a career in the arts.</p>
<h3>3. The Arts &amp; Creativity Program goal is to “elevate the arts and enable creative expression to engage and inspire a dynamic, thriving Massachusetts.” What is your primary focus right now?</h3>
<p>As struggles for racial equity have swept the country, the Arts &amp; Creativity program has taken seriously the charge to examine all our activities to push ourselves and our sector toward anti-racism.</p>

<p>There is no way our community can thrive without an intentional focus on racial equity and the inclusion of everyone, especially communities that have been left out of the mainstream.</p>

<p>That means wrestling with the challenges associated with running arts institutions and organizations as well as supporting BIPOC artists and allies in confronting white supremacy. We also need to change what gets valued in the art world. Historically, what has been most valued is art from the Western European canon; that’s what gets labeled ‘fine art,’ and arts that come from other communities we call ‘folk’ art or ‘traditional’ art.</p>

<p>We can create room in our sector to value all experiences. Over the course of 2021, the Arts team will be developing a strategy to ensure we contribute to building racial equity in the sector and society through our  grantmaking and other activities for many years to come.</p>
<h3>4. Before joining Barr, you spent 13 years as a leader at the Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center. What are some of the things you are most proud of from your time at BCNC?</h3>
<p>When I was at BCNC, I was part of the effort to create a new arts and cultural facility, the Pao Arts Center. It was borne out of a belief that a vibrant, healthy community has access to arts that speak to them and reflect their experiences. This access is essential, so that people can fully express themselves - their joy, love, anger - and live robust lives.</p>

<p>The process of opening Pao Arts Center was decades in the making, with many people helping to push the boulder up the hill, bit by bit. Many people who originally helped to reclaim the parcel of land for Chinatown were not around to see what finally came of it: not only the Pao Arts Center, but affordable housing and neighborhood retail space that many fought to get in place. I was proud and moved to be part of stewarding the project into reality, and honored to be entrusted with the leadership of an anchor organization in Chinatown.</p>

<p><em>Giles spoke recently about the Pao Arts Center project as part of a Martin Luther King Day community celebration organized by Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts and King Boston, featuring reflections from community leaders in a new film, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8A59zz5gAA&feature=youtu.be"">&quot;Voice on King&quot;</a> by <a href=""https://www.beyondmeasureproductions.com/"">Beyond Measure Productions</a>.</em></p>

<h3>5. While at BCNC you were both a Barr grantee and a Barr Fellow. What, if anything, has surprised you about your transition into the funder role?</h3>
<p>Barr was one of the key funders of the Pao Arts Center, and I truly valued the insight and partnership that helped us bring it to life. But although I had that experience as well as that of the fellowship, I was still so surprised, when I came to Barr, about how much goes into making a grant. There’s a lot of process and intention to ensure everyone is on the same page, and that investments in communities have impact.</p>

<p>I was also surprised at how deeply program officers care about the success of their grantees. On the grantee side, I know it can often feel like funders are asking tough questions that you don’t always have answers to - and I know first-hand how unsettling that can feel. I’m learning now that those questions are about helping us be better advocates and partners for our grantees.</p>
<h3>6. So what advice do you have for grantees and grantseekers?</h3>
<p>It may sound simple, but ask what makes a program officer interested in you. As a grantseeker it can feel like you have to put on a dog and pony show, guessing what funders want to see. But instead of catering to what you think they want, it’s better to have a frank conversation about why a funder is interested in the first place. Sometimes that can lead both funders and grantseekers to ask new questions and find new perspectives on their work.</p>
<h3>7. You came to Barr with not only a deep history in the social sector, but also a personal involvement in the arts. How did your journey lead you to Barr? What creative projects are you working on now?</h3>
<p>Art is what brought me into the social sector. Fifteen or twenty years ago, if people knew me at all, they knew me as a community-based artist or a cultural organizer. That path led me to run a new community arts education program at BCNC starting in 2006. From there, I moved from working on my own individual craft and creative career, to thinking and planning at a program level, to eventually confronting systemic challenges for the organization, the neighborhood, and the families we served. By investing my own energy and creativity in being part of the collective and connecting more deeply with the people of my local community, it nurtured my sense of belonging, and strengthened my commitment to work for a more equitable society.</p>

<p>It feels fitting that I’ve come back to working with the arts sector. I’m a different person than I was in my youth, in a different role and a different place, but my values are still at the center. I believe in justice, I believe in democracy, I believe in the power of every person to work in their own family and community to fix what’s broken in our society.</p>

<p>My own creative work has taken a backseat, but I have a couple of projects that I keep on returning to when inspiration strikes. I may just share them with my family, or maybe there’s a place for them out in the world one day. I can’t say I know yet!</p>"
775,"To Advance Racial Equity, Foundation Boards Need to Take an Active Role",<p>Reflections from Barr's board chair and president amidst the Foundation's continuing equity journey.</p>,"<p>The events of 2020 inspired many words about the imperative of putting racial equity at the center of philanthropy. The opening days of 2021 have only reinforced the urgency of this message. Less explored, however, has been the necessity of ensuring that foundation boards are fully engaged as partners and leaders in transforming our institutions and how we do our work.</p>

<p>As we reflect on our own equity journey at the Barr Foundation, it is evident that our board’s active engagement has been of the utmost importance to our deepened commitment to racial equity. It has enabled us to engage in crucial (and often challenging) conversations and decisions. We share our lessons here in hopes they may be of service to others.</p>

<p>Like many of our peers, Barr recently affirmed a <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/an-enduring-commitment-to-racial-equity"">commitment to racial equity</a> and communicated our intention to significantly expand our grantmaking, guided by three principles for this moment and for the years ahead:</p>

<ul>
<li>We must be unequivocal about our foundation’s commitment to racial equity.</li>
<li>We must view this as a long-term commitment.</li>
<li>We must expand our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion with a focus on anti-racism.</li>
</ul>

<p>For us, getting to this point has been an intentional journey many years in the making. Here are three lessons from a board that has embraced this work:</p>
<h3>1. Ensure your board reflects diversity of voices, perspectives, and life experiences.</h3>
<p>At foundations and nonprofits, we often focus our discussions about board diversity on demographic characteristics, and those are absolutely essential. Indeed for Barr, the decision five years ago to broaden our board beyond its two co-founders and president was linked to an expressed commitment to greater diversity of race, ethnicity, and gender.</p>

<p>We are still a small board today, with seven directors, three of whom are family members. Our board now consists of a majority (four) of women, and nearly half (three) are people of color. But beyond these demographics, our trustees bring varied life experiences and perspectives to our deliberations, including members who have worked directly on efforts to address gang violence, the leader of a community development corporation in a predominantly Latino community, and the volunteer chair of the City of Boston’s newly created racial-equity fund.</p>

<p>These diverse backgrounds and networks enrich board deliberations and keep us grounded in the opportunities, needs, and concerns within the varied communities we aim to support. It also means our board members bring a certain credibility, authority, and voice that can speak directly to this moment. As one tangible illustration, we share this heartfelt and powerful <a href=""https://today.emerson.edu/2020/06/01/letter-to-the-emerson-community-may-31-2020/"">letter</a> written in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder by one of Barr’s trustees, Emerson College President Lee Pelton (who was recently appointed president and CEO of the Boston Foundation).</p>

<p>Importantly, we have also been intentional about building a board whose members don’t share a deep history together. We recognize that, while pre-existing relationships can make it easy for boards to work together, they can also lead to insular thinking and even inhibit open dialogue. For effective boards, varied ideas and expansiveness of thinking should be the goal.</p>
<h3>2. Don’t delegate diversity, equity, and inclusion work.</h3>
<p>For over two years now, our organization has been on a journey to more deeply understand the ways in which diversity, equity, and inclusion play out in our work, both in regard to our internal culture and practices and our grantmaking strategies and priorities. Over this time, we have developed shared vocabulary, assessed our intercultural competencies (both individually and as an organization), deepened our understanding of structural racism and anti-Blackness and how they manifest in our society (and in institutions like ours), and applied our learning to various facets of our work.</p>

<p>At every step of this journey, the two of us, as organizational leaders, have been personally engaged. As president, Jim has served as an active member of Barr’s internal DEI working group, and as board chair, Barbara has participated in all of our training sessions, retreats, and all-staff workshops. Racial equity has also become a regular agenda item for our full trustee meetings — where our fellow trustees have the opportunity to engage with our staff on how these issues manifest in our program areas and in our own operations. We have also created opportunities to engage with other leaders; recently, we were joined by Boston’s new chief of equity, Karilyn Crockett, to discuss her efforts in this newly created cabinet position.</p>

<p>We have done all this not only because we seek to learn and grow ourselves but because we believe DEI efforts simply do not work when they are treated as something for the staff to do on its own. Leadership’s active sponsorship of and direct engagement with DEI work is essential. It demonstrates institutional buy-in and commitment, and it leads to stronger relationships, open dialogue, and a better workplace.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--DEI""> <p>believe</p> </blockquote></p>
<h3>3. Commit to authenticity and vulnerability as well as to engaging in challenging and uncomfortable conversations.</h3>
<p>One of the early findings in our work on DEI was that our “culture of politeness” was a barrier to open, honest, and difficult — but essential — conversations. The power dynamics of the two of us being in these discussions didn’t necessarily make it easier at the outset.</p>

<p>To our staff’s credit, however, they did not shy away from pushing these harder conversations — even with us in the room. And I hope we, too, played a role by demonstrating curiosity, probing for more detail when warranted, and allowing our own vulnerability and uncertainty to be expressed and seen by all. As challenging and difficult as some of the discussions have been, we are becoming a better organization because of them.</p>

<p>What we have learned together is that engaging in DEI as a foundation requires that our staff and board confront their own privilege and interrogate the power we hold as gatekeepers to the foundation’s resources. We also must consider what organizational practices may work against our commitments to equity. Requiring grant seekers to have a minimum annual budget size as a precondition for support is one example of the types of practices we are taking a close look at — as we explore who benefits and who is marginalized by our grantmaking and by our choices of vendors, consultants, and researchers.</p>

<p>We know we are just at the start, with a great deal of work still to do. Yet we share these reflections today to encourage others to do the same. There is certainly much for all of us to learn from each other.</p>

<p>What is eminently clear to us, however, is that absent the active engagement of foundation board members and leadership in DEI work, change will not take hold in our institutions. Let’s be sure to seize this moment to make it otherwise.</p>

774,We Should Not Be Surprised,"<p>In the aftermath of insurrection in Washington D.C., reflections from Barr’s president on what enabled yesterday’s violence and what it demands of each of us.</p>","<p>On this morning after the seat of our nation’s government was attacked by domestic terrorists, these are among the truths that are self-evident:</p>

<ul>
<li>Language matters here: these were not protesters exercising their first amendment rights. This was a treasonous mob attempting a coup.</li>
<li>Had this been a group of Black and Brown people, the response by law enforcement and the number of deaths and arrests would have been very different.</li>
<li>White privilege was on display yesterday, plain and simple.</li>
<li>If we continue to ignore the structural racism that normalizes yesterday’s actions, we do so at our peril, and we undermine what our country stands for.</li>
</ul>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--here""> <p>matters</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>On a day that also represented a shift in power in the United States Senate, we can look to a new day ahead. And yes, we must turn the page on this ugly and destructive chapter in our nation’s history, fomented and fueled by a self-absorbed demagogue. As our President-Elect has said, it is indeed a time for rebuilding, restoring and reuniting.</p>

<p>At the same time, we can neither ignore nor forget how we got to what we witnessed yesterday: this violence was incited by our own elected leaders. It was enabled by those whose own thirst for power and cowardice kept them from holding our president accountable. In pretending they could downplay or ignore his actions, they justified and amplified dangerous, undemocratic words and actions. In doing so, they made it evident that white supremacy still reigns in America.</p>

<p>Our work must begin by acknowledging these realities, by determining the role each of us needs to play to contribute to a new and different future, and by holding our leadership—and ourselves—accountable. It is these points that especially deserve our attention as we talk about “turning the page.”</p>

<p>One may wonder why a nonprofit, philanthropic institution such as the Barr Foundation should issue any statement. We do so not out of any sense of self-importance nor to imply any specialized knowledge of how we got here and what the solutions should be.</p>

<p>Rather we add our voice to the chorus of those speaking up because we must speak out. January 6, 2021 will forever be a date etched in our memories, and when we look back, it is our hope at Barr that we do so with abject horror at what occurred and a sense of pride that this served as the moment that we spoke out, stood up, and acted to counter everything that was so wrong and so antithetical to our country’s beliefs, and yet so indicative of our country today.</p>

<p>One image from yesterday still stands out for me: the workers in our nation’s Capitol cleaning up so our lawmakers could resume the work of our democracy.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3477/small.png?1642127315 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3477/medium.png?1642127315 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3477/large.png?1642127315 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3477/x_large.png?1642127315 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""Three men sweeping and vacuuming a hallway in the US Capital in the aftermath of destruction by treasonous mob."" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3477/small.png?1642127315"" /> </div> <div class=""Media-caption""> <p>Credit</p> </div> </div></p>

<p>It is not lost that the workers in this image are all people of color, and they are cleaning up the mess left by an almost entirely white mob waving confederate flags, by rioters who would disenfranchise them of their rights, and by fellow citizens who bear animus toward them. Looking at this image, we must recognize that it has ever been thus.</p>

<p>The work to form a more perfect union will never be complete, and we have so much further to go. We will remain allies, champions and advocates in this work, motivated by the spirit that better days lie ahead. They must.</p>"
772,Embracing Winter with Creative Ways to Stay Outdoors ,<p>Inspiration and insights from cold-weather cities reimagining winter as a season to love.</p>,"<p>When it comes to winter, some cities hunker down. Others – in particular our neighbors to the north and Scandinavian cities – do not hold back. They’ve changed how they talk about the coldest season. They’ve changed their culture and mindsets and now enjoy bundling up and being outside all winter. Why only spend money on outdoor programming over the summer, when people are already out and about? Let’s focus on winter as much or even more. What could we do to help people feel connected, happy, and safe during the winter months - even during a pandemic?</p>

<p>In November 2020, the Barr Foundation Mobility team hosted a two-part webinar series exploring how people in cold-weather cities stay active and engaged throughout the winter. Part I focused on <strong>inspiration:</strong> how have cities reimagined and transformed winter? How have cultures changed to be more open minded?</p>

<iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/480902018"" width=""640"" height=""360"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; fullscreen"" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Part II followed up with the nuts-and-bolts - the <strong>implementation:</strong> how to actually try out some of these ideas. Local practitioners shared their in-progress plans for how they are (safely) innovating in their communities this season.</p>

<iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/481430276"" width=""640"" height=""400"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""autoplay; fullscreen"" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>So how do we embrace winter, while also being mindful of not attracting big crowds this year? A few key insights from the webinars:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Shift the conversation.</strong> Let’s talk about stylish winter gear, crisp air and blue skies, powdery snow, and how it’s nice to not get sweaty when riding your bike. Leave the bleak attitude behind. Pretend you are a kid again. Winter can be a delight!</li>
<li><strong>Keep the sidewalks clear.</strong> As Gil Penalosa said, in all seasons, “sidewalks are the most important infrastructure in any city.”  Prioritizing snow removal from sidewalks help make it safe and enjoyable (and always free!) to venture out on foot!</li>
<li><strong>Think programs, not events.</strong> Events often mean crowds, or a one-time party. This year, ongoing, steady programming will spread out visits and aid in physical distancing (and may also better cater to different ages).</li>
<li><strong>Celebrate the season.</strong> Winter offers the excuse to warm by a fire pit, sit in the sun, drink a warm beverage, and keep moving to stay warm. Installations and programming that bring in elements that celebrate the season make it all the more special.</li>
<li><strong>Get creative.</strong> Government has adapted throughout 2020 – allowing things like more outdoor dining – and this type of fresh looks at old regulations is often needed to get creative over the winter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Can we find joy this winter? Boston Globe contributor Renee Loth says <a href=""https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/11/20/opinion/learning-love-bleak-season/"">absolutely yes</a>, (“but some creamy hot chocolate around a fire pit wouldn’t hurt”).</p>

769,Six Things Massachusetts Voters are Saying About Clean Energy ,"<p>Recent poll shows strong support for decisive action on climate, including a full transition to clean and renewable energy.</p>","<p>In September, Barr’s Climate and Clean Energy Team commissioned <a href=""https://www.globalstrategygroup.com/"">Global Strategies Group</a> to survey Massachusetts voters on clean energy issues. Our goal was to better understand awareness and opinions about current opportunities and challenges. We also sought to inform ongoing efforts to educate and communicate effectively about the connections between energy, climate, equity, and public health.</p>

<p>The poll surveyed 604 registered voters across Massachusetts over a five-day period at the end of September, with an oversampling in Gateway Cities.</p>

<p>There are three big takeaways and six key insights from the data that I wanted to highlight in this post.</p>

<p>First, it is abundantly clear that <strong>voters in Massachusetts are ready for bold and decisive action to address the climate crisis</strong>, including a complete transition to clean and renewable energy statewide.</p>

<p>Second, <strong>Massachusetts voters trust scientists and public health experts above all others to convey the facts on energy issues</strong>. This finding is critical to ensuring that the link between air pollution, climate change, and the severity of airborne diseases, like COVID-19, is fully recognized by policymakers and the public.</p>

<p>Third, the survey found <strong>increasingly negative attitudes towards natural gas and other fossil fuels</strong>. The data showed that these attitudes were informed by the damage these fuels cause to public health and safety, as well as the high levels of climate pollution emitted from fossil fuels.</p>

<p>Additionally, here are six key insights we’ve been sharing with our partners that are informing our strategies for the way ahead:</p>

<ol>
<li>A significant majority of voters in Massachusetts (65%) describe climate change as a crisis or very serious problem.

768,The Racial Leadership Gap Among Massachusetts Nonprofits,"<p>New report finds progress, yet much work still to do for the sector to realize more diverse and inclusive leadership.</p>","<p>As two of the largest grantmakers in Greater Boston, the Barr Foundation and the Boston Foundation share a longstanding commitment to the vibrant nonprofit sector in our region. To help this sector be as effective as it can be, our foundations also share the goal of increasing the number and influence of people of color serving among its leaders. We believe that the clearest insights, the most relevant solutions, and the most enduring impacts are propelled by leaders who bring firsthand experience, and who have forged deep relationships of mutual trust and respect among the people and communities where they work.</p>

<p>To build understanding of how our region is doing relative to this goal, we commissioned Building Movement Project to augment their national research on nonprofit leadership with a deep dive into Massachusetts – including a survey of more than 400 nonprofit leaders and employees, and a series of focus groups that were conducted shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Among the principal findings of their resulting report – <a href=""https://racetolead.org/ma-2019/"">The Burden of Bias in the Bay State</a> - is that Greater Boston’s nonprofit sector continues to face a substantial racial leadership gap. Furthermore, it asserts that, if we are not intentional about disrupting our biases, practices, and policies that reinforce this gap, we can only expect more of the same.</p>

<p>The Greater Boston region is rapidly becoming more diverse. The 2019 <a href=""https://www.bostonindicators.org/reports/report-website-pages/changing-faces-of-greater-boston"">Changing Faces of Greater Boston</a> report documents that people of color represent 32% of Greater Boston’s population, and 56% of people in the City of Boston. Yet, according to the 2017 <a href=""https://www.tbf.org/-/media/tbforg/files/reports/nonprofit-leadership-final.pdf?la=en"">Opportunity in Change</a> report, 85% of Greater Boston nonprofit leaders identify as White. As the Building Movement Project discovered, this discrepancy persists even though nonprofit professionals of color are just as qualified as their White counterparts (in terms of professional experience and education attainment), and significantly more likely to express interest in becoming organizational leaders.</p>

<p><img src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3419/original.png?1604350569"" alt=""Figure 1""> </p>

<p>We are grateful for the Building Movement Project’s leadership on this critical challenge facing our sector, and for the dedication and generosity of the nonprofit professionals and leaders who participated in the survey and focus groups to inform our collective learning. The work before us is daunting but not unsurmountable and, as you will see in the report, by working together, real change is absolutely possible:</p>

767,Keep Listening to Teachers,<p>Insights from Massachusetts teachers about what they are learning and how they are responding in this unprecedented back-to-school season.</p>,"<p><em>We’re all first year teachers right now.” - Sydnee Chaffee, 9th Grade ELA Teacher at Codman Academy, and 2017 National Teacher of the Year</em></p>

<p>At the <a href=""https://www.theteachercollaborative.org/"">Teacher Collaborative</a>, we believe in the power of listening to and elevating the voices of teachers — those who are closest to students, and working alongside them and their families day in and day out. Teachers have unique insights into what works, what needs fixing, and how to fix it.</p>

<p>COVID-19 turned teachers’ worlds upside down and took away so many critical “tools of the trade” — being able to physically be with students, read their expressions and body language, comfort them, high five them for a job well done; having access to books, whiteboards, manipulatives, posters, paper, and and more. In a blink, that was all gone.</p>

<p>Overnight, teachers reimagined everything, bringing even the most seasoned teacher back to those early-career days of having to build new systems and routines from the ground up and asking all teachers to consider: what’s really important here?</p>

<p>A new school year is now well underway and teachers are making it work in a variety of modes: in-person, virtual, and every form of hybrid in between. Over Zoom, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRUNvr0mJNg&feature=youtu.be"">we’ve been checking in</a> with teachers simply to ask: How’s it going? What are your hopes and fears? What do you need?</p>

<p>Here is some of what we heard:</p>
<h3>“We can’t do this alone.”</h3>
<p><div class=""Media -full""> <div class=""u-fluid-iframe""> <div class=""u-fluid-iframe-inner""> <iframe src=""//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iYt-yAf-aNM?controls=2&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;wmode=transparent"" title=""Featured Video"" frameborder=""0"" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen loading=""lazy""> <a href=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iYt-yAf-aNM?controls=2&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;wmode=transparent"">A video on YouTube</a> </iframe> </div> </div> </div>
One resounding theme has been the importance of collaborating with other teachers. Teaching has been under the shadow of an out-dated norm of individualism, wherein every teacher creates and executes teaching behind closed doors. The majority of teachers have experienced the benefits of collaboration—from making things easier to execute to making them more effective. But most schools are not structured around adequate collaboration time, never mind opportunities to collaborate beyond the school walls. Now, however, collaboration is not a nice to have, it’s a must have. As Sydney Chaffee, 9th grade ELA teacher at Codman Academy in Dorchester says: “We literally don’t have enough time to do this alone.”</p>
<h3>“We’re all in the same boat.”</h3>

Teachers, from those in year one to those in year twenty-one, are all having an experience that unites them and highlights how much is the same about teaching, regardless of who, when, or where a teacher teaches.

There is plenty that is hard right now - even for 2020 Massachusetts Teacher of the Year Takeru Nagayoshi, who is an AP English Teacher at New Bedford High School.
“We&#39;re not just academic instructors. We have to be tech specialists, attendance officers, motivational coaches, social workers, life counselors...the list goes on. Teachers have always had to wear multiple hats, but this year it feels like there&#39;s not enough time in the day to wear any of them well. And in this unprecedented setting, we&#39;re learning on the job.”</p>

<p>Teachers are no strangers to adversity. Overwhelmingly, teachers are bringing creative solutions and positive attitudes to their work. Yet it’s still important to hear what they’re experiencing, and to ask, How can we better support the people who support the kids?</p>

766,Building a Stronger and More Diverse Arts Sector ,"<p>New report finds Live Arts Boston program having strong positive impacts on arts ecosystem, expanding access and visibility, particularly for artists of color.</p>","<p>Earlier this month, the Boston Foundation hosted an online forum featuring a new assessment of <a href=""http://www.tbf.org/LAB"">Live Arts Boston</a> (LAB). Launched in 2017 as a partnership between Barr and The Boston Foundation, LAB has now supported 245 projects by individual artists, groups of artists, and small arts organizations in Greater Boston. These artists represent a remarkable diversity of races and ethnicities, backgrounds and stages in their careers, and their work spans a wide variety of artistic disciplines. Since 2017, the LAB program has also grown and evolved, providing artists and arts organizations not only with over $3 million in grants, but also with a range of supports to elevate their practice, professional profile, and financial health. LAB has also adopted a participatory approach to grantmaking – engaging members of Greater Boston’s arts community in the application-review and decision-making process.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full""> <div class=""u-fluid-iframe""> <div class=""u-fluid-iframe-inner""> <iframe src=""//player.vimeo.com/video/461021397?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0"" title=""Featured Video"" frameborder=""0"" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen loading=""lazy""> <a href=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/461021397?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0"">A video on Vimeo</a> </iframe> </div> </div> </div></p>

<p>To understand what the impacts of LAB have been for grantees, as well as for the larger ecosystem of artists in Greater Boston, we commissioned Barbara Schaffer Bacon and Pam Korza of <a href=""http://www.animatingdemocracy.org/"">Animating Democracy</a> (a program of Americans for the Arts) to conduct interviews and focus groups with LAB grantees, to review grant applications and final reports, and to document the ways in which the program evolved during its initial three-year pilot phase in response to grantee feedback and to our changing context.</p>

<p>LAB responded directly to two major developments in 2016 for arts and creativity in Boston and Greater Boston. The first was <a href=""http://www.tbf.org/"">a study commissioned by The Boston Foundation</a> showing the vast majority of funding for arts in Greater Boston (including from individual donors and from institutional philanthropy) went to a few large arts organizations. This made it enormously challenging for individual artists and small companies to continue doing their work here, and to make Boston their creative home. The second development was <a href=""http://www.cityofboston.gov/BostonCreates"">Boston Creates</a>, which was Boston’s first-ever cultural plan. Among its overarching goals was to create “fertile ground for a vibrant and sustainable arts and culture ecosystem” – including redressing this imbalance in local arts funding.</p>

<p>A global pandemic, profound economic downturn, and widespread uprisings for racial justice have all deeply affected the arts sector – and especially individual artists. They have also made it clear how much people and communities need creativity and cultural expression.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--pandemic""> <p>global</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>This is why we have sustained our commitment to LAB. In June, we announced the newest class of LAB grantees, our fourth cohort, and in the coming months, we will announce the next opportunity to apply for LAB funding in 2021.</p>

<p>In response to this uniquely challenging year, LAB artists are creating new work we know will help us to find meaning, to heal, to imagine a more just future, and to feel inspired and emboldened to bring that future into being. Guided by what we’ve learned in these first years, we hope LAB can help fuel these artists as culture-bearers, innovators, and community leaders for years to come – and that the positive impacts documented in this report will inspire others to invest more deeply in artists as well.</p>

765,Don’t Let the School Year Go to Waste,<p>Leah Hamilton and Elina Alayeva share three priorities for a student-centered school year throughout the pandemic.</p>,"<p>Even before schools started reopening, some were already predicting this school year would be a loss, and that rampant inequities would only worsen.  Yet, we take inspiration from school leaders who are stepping up, thinking outside the box, and creating high-quality learning experiences even now.</p>

<p>While the challenges are immense, there are also opportunities. We encourage educators everywhere to embrace new ways of doing school—not just as stop gap measures until we can return to “normal,” but as ways to transform our schools for the better for the long-term.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--inspiration""> <p>take</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>We know this is a big ask. Health and safety concerns loom large for teachers, students, and families. So do basic needs – ensuring students have access to healthy food, safe places to work, technology, and more. Schools are just starting to roll out virtual, hybrid, or in-person learning – all with new protocols, new ways of using technology, and great uncertainty about how everything will work. But we have seen what is possible. Our two organizations support high schools across New England and nationally that are doing school differently.</p>

<p>As we’ve talked to educators, we have been inspired by so much creativity and positive impacts. What are some doing right? There are many things, big and small. Yet, we’ve seen three key priorities we urge schools to embrace:</p>
<h3>First, commit to forging deep, personal connections with every student.</h3>
<p>Nearly every educator we spoke with this spring said the most important thing they did to regularly engage each student – so they could understand what each student needed and how to tailor support for them. We saw teachers meeting virtually, one-on-one with students on flexible schedules and providing academic support in many modalities. Some of our high school partners held weekly discussions with students about what they were experiencing with COVID, and amidst uprisings for racial justice. These forums allowed students to share their experiences, develop deeper relationships with adults and peers, and access both personal and academic supports. At one school, small teams of faculty members worked together to provide outreach and support for students facing different needs. For example, one team supported seniors navigating decisions about college, while another team conducted (socially distant) home visits to students who had not been responsive to other forms of outreach from the school.</p>
<h3>Second, strengthen connections with families – through frequent, transparent, accessible communications.</h3>
<p>We saw many schools embrace a new level of family-school connection. Many adopted regular virtual “town halls.” Some even held these weekly. These and other forms of virtual connection enabled parents to stay informed, to raise questions and concerns, and to be partners with their schools in shaping plans for reopening – all without the usual scheduling or travel-related constraints that always challenge families’ ability to participate in in-person meetings.</p>
<h3>Third, redouble commitments to equity.</h3>
<p>This spring, some students grappled not only with technology issues, but were also caring for siblings so their parents could work, struggling to find quiet places to study or a decent internet connection. In Boston Public Schools last spring, one in five students never logged in a single time to virtual school. Meanwhile, other students enjoyed private study spaces, fast and reliable internet, great technology, and school was their only responsibility. To close equity gaps, learning needs to be rigorous and relevant for students, and schools need good, reliable data on how students are doing. By connecting with every child and by staying in close communications with their families, schools can also design learning experiences that reflect the wide range of experiences student bring with them to school.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--are""> <p>stakes</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>The stakes are high. Student learning is at risk and gaping inequities will only grow, unless we are intentional, creative, and flexible. It will not be easy. But let’s seize the opportunity of this once-in-a-generation disruption to do school differently and ensure it works for all young people.</p>

<p><em>This article originally published in Commonwealth Magazine under the title, <a href=""https://commonwealthmagazine.org/education/dont-let-the-school-year-go-to-waste/"">&quot;Don&#39;t Let the School Year Go to Waste&quot;</a>.</em></p>"
764,Views that Matter,<p>A new report by the Sustainable Solutions Lab at UMass Boston sets the ground for more inclusive public opinion research on climate change.</p>,"<p>As part of my work with the Sustainable Solutions Lab (SSL) at UMass Boston, I was honored to work with Dr. Lorena Estrada-Martínez and Dr. Paul Watanabe on the recent report: <a href=""https://www.umb.edu/ssl/research""><em>Views that Matter: Race and Opinions on Climate Change in Boston Area Residents</em></a>. Our research aimed to capture views on climate change across residents of color in the Boston area. Thanks to funding from the Barr Foundation and an additional partnership with the Hyams Foundation, we were able to collect enough data from communities of color in Greater Boston to get a statistically significant sample – and understand more clearly differences across demographics.</p>

<p>Generally, public opinion research on climate change – and a range of other topics – has not adequately accounted for the views of people of color. Although in Massachusetts, for example, several statewide surveys have been conducted on climate change, the size of the samples have been too small to make reliable assessments of opinions from residents of color. Being aware of this gap in public opinion research, we endeavored to collect data that reflects the vital views of Black, Asian American, Latino/a, and white residents of Greater Boston.</p>

<p><em>Views that Matter</em> establishes a baseline for inclusive public opinion research on climate change that can inform policy debates and responses related to the climate crisis.</p>

<p>The opinions expressed are wide-ranging and indicate broad areas of agreement among the four racial and ethnic groups as well as some areas where views diverge.  Below are a few key takeaways from our research.</p>
<h3>Multiracial broad agreement</h3>
<p>There is a common understanding among Greater Boston residents that climate change is happening and that it will cause serious problems if left unaddressed. When asked about a range of impacts often associated with climate change, an overwhelming majority agreed that these are already happening or will very likely be happening soon in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Residents believe that climate change effects can be reversed through policy change at the local and federal levels. For that, residents think that both government and individual efforts are needed to address climate change.  </p>
<h3>Unequal capacities</h3>
<p>Critical areas where views often varied along racial/ethnic lines were opinions on preparedness and planning to deal with extreme weather events. The data, for example, show disparities in planning and preparation that could seriously compromise the ways in which communities of color are able to overcome the impacts of climate change. When asked about a series of action plans often associated with weather and other emergencies, three-fourths of white residents reported having insured their home and belongings compared to 57% of Blacks, and 54% of Latinos/as and Asian Americans. Fewer than half of Asian Americans and Blacks report that they would have sufficient essential supplies in the face of a severe weather event.</p>
<h3>A Call for Justice</h3>
<p>Holding policy debates and making decisions on policy without consideration of the opinions of significant and long-time silenced communities reinforces unequal impacts and responses posed by climate change. This pattern of disparate impacts has been shown with other disasters including, tragically, during the current COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>In short the lesson is clear – the impact of global challenges, whether related to the climate crisis or the spread of deadly viruses, vary across communities. Prevailing economic and racial injustices are at the root of these problems. One of the most reliable routes to addressing these injustices is starting with data that reflects the views of all segments of the society.</p>

762,Five Focus Areas For Schools Navigating COVID-19,<p>Insights from school leaders engaging support from the new Mass Ready Fund to adapt and keep students at the center during the pandemic.</p>,"<p><em>“There is so much that needs to be done. Our schools attempted distance learning this Spring, and we need to strengthen those systems, while also closing the instructional gaps caused by lost learning time. We know that our students, families, and staff have experienced trauma as a result of Covid-19 and school shutdown, and we are striving to heal our communities. Our students must feel safe in order to engage in meaningful learning. The shift to distance teaching and learning has been challenging for teachers and that we need to better support them in order to meet the needs of our students now and in the years to come.” - School System Leader</em></p>

<p>COVID-19 and its fallout have dramatically altered the education landscape. To help school and system leaders navigate this complex and uncharted territory, the Barr Foundation partnered with <a href=""http://www.catalyst-ed.org/"">Catalyst:Ed</a>, a national nonprofit to launch the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/new-support-available-to-massachusetts-schools-planning-for-2020-21"">Massachusetts Ready Fund</a> and rapidly mobilize and deploy responsive, real-time support. The Mass Ready Fund enables Local Education Agencies (LEAs), school networks, and high schools that serve 50% or more of high-need students and serve at least one high school grade level to access (at no cost to them) consulting support from a coalition of expert organizations and individuals with deep experience working with and supporting schools and systems.</p>

<p>Over a three-month period (June-Aug 2020), 43 eligible schools and districts have accessed over $500k worth of support from 16 different technical assistance providers. Together, these schools and districts serve over 200,000 students. A majority are traditional public school districts or schools.</p>

<p>So what are we hearing and learning from school leaders and technical assistance providers from our work so far? While the earliest projects focused on drafting reopening plans under differing scenarios, we are now seeing schools go deeper - more recent projects have focused on improving student and family experiences and outcomes, especially for the most vulnerable student populations. In this vein, we see five critical areas where schools and systems are requesting and accessing support right now:</p>
<h3>1. Improved remote learning</h3>
<p><em>“Remote learning is a foreign educational landscape for us.” - School Leader</em></p>

<p>When schools shifted to distance learning in Spring, few leaders anticipated that the uncertainty would continue, school reopenings in Fall would be delayed, and that most schools would be opening remotely or with hybrid models. As a result, few schools and systems were fully prepared for the 2020-21 academic year. Recognizing this, several of the schools and systems that accessed expert support through the Mass Ready Fund are working with their providers to develop more robust remote learning plans, redesign learning experiences so they are more engaging and relevant, and implement best practices such as the use of a “primary person,” so families and students have one point person at the school to go to for questions or to address any needs.</p>
<h3>2. Social-emotional learning and trauma-informed practices</h3>
<p><em>“School closure revealed several gaps in our practices and capacity to support students with trauma. We now understand the need to go beyond having a few counselors in a few schools to having programs and systems for the whole district to reach all students daily.” - School System Leader</em></p>

<p>Many students and families have been directly affected by COVID-19, and are suffering from sickness, unemployment, and/or food and housing insecurity. The social isolation in and of itself has also negatively affected students’ mental health. The toll on physical, social, and emotional health has been exacerbated for students who rely on their schools for safety, security, and sustenance. A few schools are creating plans for addressing this through a whole school, whole child, whole community approach. Several schools and systems are working with providers to develop virtual, tiered, social emotional support plans as well as professional development on Social Emotional Learning (SEL) and trauma informed practices.</p>
<h3>3. Family engagement</h3>
<p><em>“We want to keep our community informed of our efforts so that they can understand what is happening and how they can be the best partners possible in this next phase. During remote learning, we also witnessed some excellent examples of how instruction can tap into families’ funds of knowledge. We need to provide more professional learning opportunities in this area to ensure all educators are designing and delivering instruction that builds with the assets of our students, families, and communities.” - School Leader</em></p>

<p>The continually changing guidance from local, state, and federal public health and education officials has been a source of stress on students, families, and on educators. To mitigate this anxiety, several schools have focused on strengthening how they communicate to and engage with families, as well as address questions, concerns, and needs. The goal is to foster an environment where families can trust that they are being heard, their needs are being taken into consideration, and they are being kept informed about decisions in a rapidly changing situation. Schools are currently working on projects that include developing family engagement strategies, drafting communications, and implementing best practices such as family hotlines for direct access by phone to school administrators</p>
<h3>4. Focused support for students who need it most</h3>
<p><em>“English Learners&#39; educational challenges have been compounded by COVID-19, and we need to implement wrap-around support so they are positioned to succeed in a new learning environment.” - School System Leader</em></p>

<p>Remote learning has been especially challenging and ineffective for students with special needs, such as special education students or English Language Learners, whose needs are not fully addressed even during normal times. Schools are working on projects such as developing plans aimed at identifying and supporting students most in need of support, training teachers in remote instructional practices designed to advance content and language acquisition for special student populations, communicating with families, and gauging and supporting the socio-emotional well-being of families and students.</p>
<h3>5. Assessment and acceleration</h3>
<p><em>“We realize that many of our students may need to fit more than a year of learning into a single school year. Simply reteaching and implementing remediation strategies will not achieve this goal and will in fact only widen achievement gaps.”- School System Leader</em></p>

<p>School closures over Spring and the continued uncertainty over school reopening this Fall have likely created massive learning losses and could result in long-term consequences for all students, and especially those who were already behind. Some schools are working to mitigate this possibility by implementing learning assessment and acceleration strategies aimed at putting every student on a fast track back to grade level</p>

<p>Despite the activity and the progress, challenges remain. COVID-19 has laid bare the underlying fragility and inequities of our education system. The continuing uncertainty has made it hard for teams to decide where they should invest their time, efforts and resources. Funding remains a constraint, and technological preparedness continues to be a concern. Staffing is emerging as a challenge as schools balance the needs of the remote and in-person learners as well as their teachers. Finally, leaders need more support to deal with the unprecedented uncertainty and challenge of the current moment so they can lead more resilient and agile organizations.</p>

<p>And yet, there are also some bright spots. We see schools who see this crisis as an opportunity to innovate and to be creative. We also see individual teachers who are rethinking their classrooms virtually, and using welcoming and inclusive tactics to make sure students learn. A number of places are further personalizing the learning experience to more deeply respond to student needs and interests, and creating new systems to ensure every student has a primary person to support their well-being and academic progress. Slowly, but surely, new best practices are emerging, while older, proven approaches are being applied with renewed focus. Many schools have used this moment to question the status quo, focus their efforts on what is most critical, and build authentic connections with their students and families. We continue to learn from and be inspired by their work and experiences and also see an opportunity for leaders to connect with and learn from each other in the coming months.</p>

761,Reclaiming Streets as Public Spaces,"<p>Mary Skelton Roberts on the path ahead to create truly welcoming, inclusive public spaces for all.</p>","<p>This Spring, all across this country and all over the world, people took to the streets to call for justice, and to assert that Black lives matter. Their demonstrations carried through the summer and into the fall, and their calls for change have filled our neighborhoods, halls of government, and corporate boardrooms.
Perhaps more than at any other time in our nation’s history, people have recognized that the systems, structures, and spaces that make up our society are set up to benefit some, but to hinder – and even endanger – others.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/reimagining-more-just-public-spaces"">Last month on Barr’s blog</a>, Kim Szeto of the New England Foundation for the Arts announced new grant programs focused on creating more just, vibrant, and welcoming public spaces. The term of art Kim introduced is, “spatial justice” and it answers the question: <em>who is this space for?</em></p>

<p>Public art plays a powerful role in shaping the character of public spaces; so does planning and street design – which is why I wanted to join in this conversation Kim opened for us.</p>

<p>Our public spaces reinforce public values about who belongs, who is entitled to feel welcome and safe, and who is made to feel unwelcome, an intruder, or a threat. This explains why a white woman can become so offended that a Black man would ask her to leash her dog as required in a public park.  Or why armed vigilantes would feel justified chasing down and murdering a Black jogger in a residential street. Or why the police would suddenly escalate something so trivial as standing in front of a convenience store.</p>

<p>The President of the United States understood the power of place when he militarized the Capital and other cities in response to demonstrators taking to the streets.  In D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser responded by painting “BLACK LIVES MATTER” on 16th Street, which leads directly to the White House.  The same phrase is now emblazoned on 5th Avenue in New York City, Washington Street in Boston, and scores of other cities large and small – as a way to reclaim those streets, and to acknowledge the real struggles of Black Americans.</p>

<p>Yet, words alone cannot ensure that all people are welcome in our country, communities, and neighborhoods. Planning shapes what people actually experience. For generations, our approach to planning our communities has codified injustices and segregation.  Leading national Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) urban planners for years have been drawing attention to the intersection of race and planning.  My lived and professional experience as a planner of color has taught me that if we truly want to make spaces more welcoming, they must be designed by and with people of color and other marginalized individuals.</p>

<p>When I was growing up in Boston, the divisions between neighborhoods were even sharper than they are today. And people knew when they crossed certain dividing lines.  This summer, I joined a protest with my daughter, where we marched through Boston’s North End. It brought me back to my days going to high school there, when strangers would pelt me with snowballs as I walked down the street.</p>

<p>As we marched through Christopher Columbus Park and cut across Faneuil Hall, I was reminded how those places and their public artworks symbolize the vastly different histories Bostonians have experienced since the birth of our city.  For me, an Afro-Cubana Bostonian, Christopher Columbus and Peter Faneuil Hall are reminders of colonization and enslavement of my people.  Our streets can simultaneously contain multiple and seemingly conflicting histories: subjugation or innovation, segregation or opportunity, injustice or equity. Urban planners have a responsibility to create spaces for these fuller truths to exist.</p>

<p>The protest march that day this summer gave me a glimpse into what a truly inclusive Boston could be. As we moved from City Hall, to the South End, and into Roxbury, I knew my city has changed. Each of these neighborhoods now feels physically accessible; old barriers visible and invisible are no more. Each of us, with all of our varying identities – young, old, Black, White, LatinX, queer, or transgender – we were all marching for justice and taking space in our streets.</p>

<p>While there is so much more work to do, Boston has come a mighty long way. For the work ahead, it is worth remembering that, and to recognize our capacity to move with shared purpose and urgency – as we have in response to COVID-19. The path ahead requires all of us – including artists and planners and many more with distinctive contributions to make. And it requires investing in leadership by Black and Brown people to create, and to realize a more inclusive vision for what Boston and other cities can become.</p>"
758,Reimagining More Just Public Spaces,"<p>Announcing new grant opportunity for Massachusetts artists and communities to plan and execute public art that creates more just, vibrant, and welcoming public spaces.</p>","<p><em>At this moment, we are reckoning with a culture and systems that have, for generations, marginalized and oppressed certain people – especially Black and other communities of color, indigenous peoples, and immigrants.

<p><a href=""http://www.nefa.org/"">New England Foundation for the Arts</a> (NEFA) is excited to launch two new public art grant opportunities.

<h3>What is Spatial Justice?</h3>
<p>As I’m reminded by our colleagues at the U.S. Department of Arts and Culture, “everything created must first be imagined, including our collective future. Social imagination is a prerequisite to positive social change.”</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--a""> “imagination” <span class=""u-nowrap"">is</span> </blockquote></p>

<p>As COVID-19 remains a threat to public health, our public spaces also continue to be plagued with the racial injustices of policing Black people, the resounding impacts of historical disinvestment in communities of color – particularly Black communities - through the redlining policies of the last century, and the amnesia of the original displacement and continued attempts at erasure of Indigenous peoples from this land.</p>

<p>A spatial justice framework helps us to recognize that public spaces are not neutral. And public art made in public places is not neutral. Many of our public spaces have been designed to normalize the aesthetics and activities of a dominant white culture that shape the spoken and unspoken expectations of our public culture.  Our colleagues at the <a href=""https://www.ds4si.org/"">Design Studio for Social Intervention</a> (ds4si) who initially introduced us to the concept of spatial justice, have helped us understand that spatial justice is about public culture – <em>it’s about who has the right to be, thrive, express, and connect in and across public space.</em>  When I think about who is welcomed to be in public spaces, I have to ask myself, “Who isn’t welcome to be in public?” Unfortunately, George Floyd wasn’t.  Ahmaud Arbery wasn’t. Their deaths were not the result of COVID-19 in this pandemic, but rather the prevalence of white supremacy culture and anti-Blackness that our current public culture has helped to normalize. </p>

<p>Public art has the power to “make the normal strange” as Lori Lobenstine, co-founder of ds4si often says. Public artmaking through a spatial justice framework is about fostering dialogue by thoughtfully and creatively engaging the context of place. Places have history, communities (often multiple communities over time) that take pride in them, and futures yet to be written. That’s what gives public artmaking power to change our future. It can de-normalize white supremacy culture and anti-Blackness; and, it can center on Black, Indigenous, and people of color, and the many intersectionalities of their identities, cultures, and artistic expressions. <a href=""https://www.ds4si.org/writings/2015/12/29/social-justice-practice-exploring-the-role-of-artists-in-creating-a-more-just-and-social-public"">Artists are essential co-conspirators</a> on this this collective journey towards imagining more just futures into being.</p>

<p>We are in a future-changing, future-creating moment. These new grants are intentional about supporting public artmaking that help us to see, feel, experience, embody, and imagine more just, more vibrant, more welcoming public spaces and changing the course of our collective future for the better.</p>

757,Glimmers of a Future We Need,<p>Today's solutions to our public health crisis are also long-term solutions for transportation and climate.</p>,"<p>For many US cities, the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic provided a remarkable if temporary glimpse of an urban environment with dramatically less car travel and air pollution. On social media, photos emerged, from typically traffic-choked Boston to smoggy Los Angeles, of open roads and clear blue skies.</p>

<p>While the reason for this change cannot be celebrated, cities have also made some admirable adjustments to meet changing needs, rapidly expanding bike lanes and closing roads to car traffic to give pedestrians and cyclists more room to breathe. Massachusetts recently launched its <a href=""https://www.mass.gov/service-details/program-overview-shared-streets-and-spaces-grant-program"">Shared Streets and Spaces Grant program</a>, which encourages every city and town in the state to improve its streets to support people to safely get to childcare and eventually school, work, and neighborhood restaurants and retail.</p>

<p>And yet it would be a mistake to assume that the past months will result in lasting change for the better. The reality is, any air quality or traffic improvements that have come from this tragedy are merely glimmers of a future we will need to create for ourselves. As cities begin to carefully return to some state of normalcy in the coming months, we could easily backslide into gridlocked streets—or we could pivot towards a low-carbon, low-pollution transportation future. Our climate and our health are at stake.</p>

<p>In one scenario, overwhelmed by fear and lacking guidance from leaders, people retreat to their personal cars at even higher rates than before the pandemic, swamping the region with traffic and polluted air. Public transit becomes a taboo for anyone who can afford a car and a parking spot, and it gets more neglected than ever.</p>

<p>But in the second, we learn from the pandemic the importance of creating environments that protect our health, and we prioritize an array of transportation options that curb driving and emissions, including a bold return to public transit and expanded walking and biking.</p>

<p>The first path is nothing short of disaster—a worst-case scenario for everyone involved, for several reasons.  </p>

<p>Perhaps most obvious is the fact that in many US cities, transportation is responsible for the majority of our air pollution and of greenhouse gas emissions. Sitting in traffic during Boston’s rush hour, you can see it in the air. Especially in places that, pre-pandemic, relied heavily on non-car travel, a post-pandemic spike in driving will drag our air quality to new lows. In the best of times, <a href=""https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/air-pollution/index.cfm"">air pollution</a> still diminishes our lung capacity, causes respiratory diseases such as asthma, and is tied to millions of <a href=""https://www.edf.org/health/health-impacts-air-pollution"">premature deaths</a> every year. And we have <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200427-how-air-pollution-exacerbates-covid-19"">early evidence</a> that pollution-related health conditions increase mortality among those infected with COVID-19.</p>

<p>Tailpipe emissions are also the number one cause in the United States of greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change, which despite the present acute health crisis from COVID, remains the largest public health challenge facing the world. Climate change undermines all the foundations of good health and can worsen chronic medical conditions and put people at higher risk of dying from diseases like COVID-19. We know, for example, that exposure to <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/extremeheat/medical.html"">extreme heat</a> makes pretty much any medical concern worse, from cardiovascular disease to mental health.</p>

<p>A relapse into greater reliance on single-occupancy vehicles and abandonment of public transit would also be an utter moral failure with ripple effects that impact everyone. Those of us who don’t have jobs that allow telecommuting, and either can’t drive or can’t afford to drive, will need to rely on public transit in any scenario. But if the Commonwealth does not take the right steps to make trains and buses safe and reliable post-pandemic, we will be forcing the most vulnerable people in our communities (who also have less access to health care and higher rates of chronic health problems) into situations where risk of viral transmission is high. This is morally unconscionable and ultimately increases infection risk for all.</p>

<p>To avoid this disastrous outcome and pursue the much brighter scenario described above, we must cultivate a greater understanding that transportation solutions are climate solutions and public health solutions. But given our current socially distanced reality, what will it take to avoid a fearful mass retreat into our cars?</p>

<h3>What will it take to avoid a fearful mass retreat into our cars?</h3><h4>Restore confidence in the safety of public transit.</h4>
<p>First, we must responsibly restore confidence in the safety of public transit. The precursor to doing so is building the best evidence-based understanding of the virus that we can, including how well it may be transmitted on a bus or train, and the prevalence and effectiveness of antibodies in the community. Some of that will depend on research happening now, around the clock, in labs all over the world. However, as with so many efforts to “reopen” society, we’ll need greater testing, tracking, and screening. Communities overseas that are successfully returning to mass transit, such as South Korea, Taiwan, and London, have done so largely with aggressive testing programs.</p>

<p>That being said, even with robust safety measures in place, cities will need to understand and address people’s fears and concerns. A good doctor knows that whatever treatment plan is needed, it can only move forward after the patient’s needs and concerns are heard and addressed. So, to get public transit back on track we have to listen first and then act. We will need to figure out riders’ concerns and fears and then do what it takes to demonstrate that their safety is top priority. Ensuring safety may require more rigorous cleaning of surfaces, or more space between riders, and those actions need to be complemented with regular communication of the safety measures that have been implemented. Leaders will also need to demonstrate their own confidence in riding transit, whether that’s elected officials, business leaders, or even sports figures.</p>
<h4>Expand biking and walking infrastructure on our streets and greenways.</h4>
<p>Finally, a major lesson we can learn from the pandemic as we plan for the future is the tremendous hunger for more green space and active transportation options, and the rewards we all reap when cities offer them. Not every resident is able to, or for that matter wants to, bike and walk as main modes of daily transportation. But recent months have shown us that when the need and the opportunity are there, at least a large portion of the population is eager to lace up their sneakers or jump on bikes.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--lesson""> <p>major</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Bogotá was one of the first cities to <a href=""https://www.smartcitiesworld.net/news/news/bogota-expands-bike-lanes-overnight-to-curb-coronavirus-spread-5127"">expand bike infrastructure</a> when the pandemic hit, opening 47 miles of temporary bike lanes, many overnight. Seattle temporarily closed <a href=""https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/seattle-will-permanently-close-20-miles-of-residential-streets-to-most-vehicle-traffic/"">nearly 20 miles</a> of streets to most vehicles to provide more space for people to walk and bike, and the mayor recently announced the change would become permanent. Several cities in the US and Europe are <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/cleaner-and-greener-covid-19-prompts-worlds-cities-to-free-public-space-of-cars"">taking similar measures</a>, reclaiming public space formerly reserved for car travel.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, Boston made changes to its own streetscape, and the opportunities are abundant to reimagine our transportation system so that biking and walking can become more prominent modes. What might that look like? There’s room even on our narrow streets to prioritize more bike lanes and protected, car-free corridors. But we might also envision supercharging biking and walking infrastructure in our parks and greenways. Imagine the Emerald Necklace as a central artery in a network of paths that connect Dorchester to the Longwood Medical area through downtown all the way up to the North End.</p>

<p>The benefits from this kind of transformation would be manifold. It would reduce personal driving, traffic, and air pollution and protect and expand green space that reduces the heat island effect, while improving heart and lung health and lowering obesity rates. In its best form, the interventions would be enacted to benefit the communities that have been hit hardest not only by the pandemic, but also historically by air pollution.</p>

<p>All this makes clear that transportation solutions, climate solutions, and public health solutions are one and the same: what we do to cope with an acute health crisis can curb the longer-term climate crisis and at the same time make communities, especially those that have been left behind, healthier right now.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--do""> <p>we</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>If we remain clear-eyed about these overlapping needs and benefits, properly address the understandable fears in our communities, and provide the right transportation options, we will have taken all the right steps to move us out of this dark period in our history. We can and should leverage COVID-19 to reimagine a brighter, more just, and healthier future.</p>

724,An Enduring Commitment to Racial Equity ,<p>Foundation trustees outline key principles for Barr’s racial equity work.</p>,"<p>In January, I wrote about <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/barr-equity-journey"">Barr’s Equity Journey</a> and our long-term work to place equity at the center of our grantmaking and organizational practices. The events of the intervening months have only deepened our commitment to advance this work.</p>

<p>Of course, the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on communities of color brought attention to many policies and systems in our country that continue to produce different outcomes based on race. Then came the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and other actions leading to the latest national reckoning about structural racism and anti-Blackness. These realities demand action. </p>

<p>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Barr’s first actions have been in the form of <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/a-message-to-our-grantees-on-covid-19"">new flexibilities and support for our grantees</a> and <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/covid-19"">$6 million in new grantmaking</a> (with our <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/barr-awards-1-36-million-to-nonprofits-supporting-black-communities-in-response-to-covid-19"">most recent grants</a> focused on organizations serving Black communities in the region). In addition, we have taken immediate actions in our core programs to provide relief and resources to our grantees while developing more in-depth and longer-term ways to sustain and reimagine the fields we work in.</p>

<p>As an organization with a determination to act directly on issues of structural racism, we are seeking to balance the urgency for action with the knowledge that sustained, enduring commitment and partnership is the only way to achieve the transformative change we need. Short-term pronouncements will not suffice.</p>

<p>My message today is to underscore Barr’s commitment to engaging with and learning from our grantees and partners, to making a significant investment in sustained action, and to inviting you to hold us accountable to that commitment.</p>

<p>Last month, our quarterly trustee meeting focused on the question: “What does this moment demand of us?” Grounded in Barr’s <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/about"">mission</a>, <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/about#core-values"">core values</a>, and current <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/grantmaking#what-we-fund"">programs</a>, our trustees agreed to three principles that will guide our efforts around racial equity:</p>

<ul>
<li>We must be unequivocal about Barr&#39;s commitment to racial equity.</li>
<li>We must view this as a long-term commitment.</li>
<li>We must expand our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion with a focus on anti-racism.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Explicit commitment to racial equity</h3>
<p>Barr’s mission is to “invest in potential” and to address barriers that inhibit full expression of potential. The events of recent months have reminded us yet again how formidable a barrier racism is to that mission. For the impact we seek, we must be unequivocal and explicit in our commitment to advancing racial equity in all that we do. This includes how we partner with organizations and communities, how our grantmaking flows into the community, and our own internal work and culture.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--unequivocal""> “must” <span class=""u-nowrap"">be</span> </blockquote></p>

<p>Each of our program teams are now re-examining their work through that lens. Rooted in our current goals and priorities, they are engaging with grantees and other partners to understand how an explicit focus on racial equity can accelerate the change we seek, and we will have more to report in the months ahead.</p>
<h3>An enduring commitment</h3>
<p>As noted above, this is a time for sustained, long-term commitments. Change of the magnitude required will not occur in three-year grant cycles or through time-limited initiatives. It will require sustained, patient, and significant investment in organizations and leaders. This is why Barr is prepared to significantly expand its grantmaking in the years ahead, particularly by augmenting investment in Barr’s core programs to deepen existing work or support new efforts that explicitly advance racial equity.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--magnitude""> “of” <span class=""u-nowrap"">the</span> </blockquote></p>
<h3>From embracing DEI to becoming an anti-racist organization</h3>
<p>We know from our own internal work on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) that this is not easy work, nor should it be. Our commitment requires that we listen deeply, that we validate others’ experiences, and that we bring deep humility to our learning. It also requires the much harder work of acknowledging where we are part of the problem, and working to change that. Where do we benefit from and sustain structures and policies that generate opportunities for some but barriers for others, based on race? Answering questions like these requires understanding our own power and privilege as a philanthropic institution, how we contribute to systems that perpetuate inequality, and how we must change.</p>

<p>Building on the work we have done related to DEI over the past few years, we now intend to focus more fully on what it would mean for Barr to become an anti-racist organization. While we have much to learn, we know that a commitment to anti-racism is a commitment to action. We will continue to share our actions and learning as we benefit from our ongoing partnership with so many of you.</p>
<h3>Accountability is essential</h3>
<p>Finally, the public calls we have heard for real and sustained action are resulting in many leaders and institutions giving voice to the urgency of addressing racial equity. Statements of solidarity and support have a certain value (and we have certainly offered ours). Yet, it is essential that rhetorical pronouncements convert to tangible action. And it is equally important that those making commitments to action in the heat of this moment are held accountable to following through. We plan to explore ways to invest in that kind of accountability for leaders and institutions in our region. And we invite the same accountability for Barr, as we make our own commitments.</p>
<h3>The time is now</h3>
<p>Much has been written about how this moment feels different, and there are many reasons to be hopeful that it is. But it will take hard work from all of us to transform this from a moment to a movement. For us at Barr, we know that we must embrace this time, with the knowledge that investing in leaders and organizations on the front lines of this work is our most powerful way of contributing to the future we all seek.</p>

<p>Drawing on one of our core values, we also must approach this time with the humility that enables us to admit what we don’t know, to listen and learn, to acknowledge when we have been wrong and made mistakes, to change and adapt, and to share power with others.</p>

<p>These are our commitments, and we are in this for the long haul.</p>

723,Adapting to a Pandemic: Barr’s Climate Program,"<p>An update on actions, learnings, and priorities from Barr’s Climate team amid the pandemic.</p>","<p>Over the last several months, Barr’s President Jim Canales has been sharing through <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/categories/covid-19"">a COVID-19 blog series</a> how the Foundation has been navigating the pandemic. These blogs have communicated three rounds of  COVID-19 grantmaking, including contributing to local emergency funds and community foundation relief efforts; supporting immigrant-serving organizations; and supporting organizations serving black communities. In addition, they have emphasized how the majority of Barr’s grantmaking has and will remain in our core areas of Climate, Arts &amp; Creativity, and Education. And, that teams like ours are aiming to demonstrate the flexibility and responsiveness that this moment demands of all of us. Below, we share what this has meant in the context of our Climate Program – with details on what we’ve learned from our grantees, and how we’ve been responding.</p>
<h3>A Phased Approach</h3>
<p>The Climate team is centering flexibility and equity in our evolving work. And, we’re thinking of our work in phases as the pandemic evolves. The phases we have identified are to: 1. <em>Respond</em> to immediate community and partner needs; 2. <em>Recover</em> from the damage and evaluate the medium- and long-term impacts; and 3. <em>Reimagine &amp; Rebuild</em>, pushing for creative solutions for how to build back better. There are no hard and fast timelines for these phases, and the work in multiple phases may overlap.</p>
<h3>Listening and Responding to Grantee Needs</h3>
<p>COVID-19 has challenged us to adapt our priorities and to find effective ways to support our grantees. In the initial months of the pandemic, we engaged with grantees through direct conversations and an online survey to understand the impact that COVID-19 is having on them and their work. Not surprisingly, grantees with fewer resources and those focused on serving people of color and people in low-income communities are being impacted first and hardest. Other organizations are experiencing delays with policy-oriented work (as the state legislature and municipal decisionmakers are consumed with COVID-19 relief efforts), including those dependent on in-person engagement and door-to-door organizing.</p>

<p>The Climate team took a range of actions to respond to varying grantee needs, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Immediate response grants</strong> for the most heavily-impacted grantee organizations that have pivoted to be frontline responders, assisting with services such as emergency housing and food distribution. </li>
<li><strong>Online trainings and convenings</strong> to support our grantees within a rapidly-changing and unprecedented context. These offerings have included communications trainings on how to adjust messaging to the COVID-19 context and resources on how to best conduct virtual engagements.<br></li>
<li><strong>Flexibility with grant outcomes and grant applications</strong> to help our grantees focus their time and attention on their work, not on paperwork. We restructured grants after listening to what organizations needed to be adaptable. We modified reporting requirements, waiving reporting entirely where appropriate. And, we streamlined the application process, so that we can get resources in the hands of organizations more quickly. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Focusing Recovery Efforts on the Hardest Hit Communities</h3>
<p>We believe the COVID-19 recovery process needs to center those who have been most harmed by the pandemic. Like climate change, COVID-19 is disproportionately impacting people of color and the poor. According to a <a href=""https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/air-pollution-linked-with-higher-covid-19-death-rates/"">recent study</a> by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, people who live in regions with high levels of air pollution are 15% more likely to die from the virus than people who live in less polluted areas.</p>

<p>In Boston, Black people comprise 40% of the coronavirus cases yet just 25% of the population. Community organizers in Chelsea and other environmental justice communities see <a href=""https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/04/29/metro/chelsea-deadly-consequences-dirty-air/"">their hotspot status</a> as a direct consequence of the environmental burdens they’ve been fighting for decades, and a <a href=""https://www.mass.gov/doc/covid-19s-unequal-effects-in-massachusetts"">recent analysis</a> by the Massachusetts Attorney General backs that up. Across the state, the virus has hit low-income and communities of color the hardest due to pre-existing high rates of asthma and other respiratory illnesses that are connected to pollution.</p>

<p>Informed by data like this, our COVID-19 recovery efforts have focused on supporting grassroots organizations serving these communities hardest hit by the pandemic. Frontline organizations play a multitude of roles within their communities, and many grantees across all of the climate focus areas have mobilized. For example, recent grants to the <strong>Vietnamese-American Initiative for Development (Viet-Aid)</strong> and the <strong>Massachusetts Coalition for Occupational Safety and Health (MassCOSH)</strong> are helping the organizations move to remote operations and to address urgent organizational needs caused by the pandemic. Viet-Aid, which owns a building in the Fields Corner neighborhood, has become a food distribution site in coordination with the City of Boston, and hundreds of community members have sought out staff support to apply for unemployment assistance and other public benefits. MassCOSH is providing support to essential workers, as shown with its <a href=""http://www.masscosh.org/publications/featured-articles/comprehensive-information-covid-19"">publication, &quot;Covid-19 Tool Kit for Essential Workers&quot;</a> in English and Spanish. In addition, a grant to the <strong>New World Foundation</strong> is supporting a number of environmental justice and equity-focused organizations in Massachusetts as they re-shape how they work and push for change. </p>
<h3>Reimagining as we Rebuild</h3>
<p>While continuing to support immediate response and recovery, the Climate team is also working with our partners to reimagine a more sustainable future for all people. More than merely rebuilding what existed before, we share a vision for a recovery from COVID-19 that advances equity and climate action. Team-led efforts include organizing webinars, conducting polling, and engaging national and international practitioners to help us and our grantees shape the future. We are addressing some fundamental questions with this research: How do we find opportunity in disruption and imagine a future that is both green and equitable? How can we move solutions forward that are beneficial to public health, economic recovery, and our climate?</p>

<p><blockquote class=""twitter-tweet""><p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">From super-blocks to climate corps, Boston climate leaders share &quot;golden opportunities&quot; for a green recovery from COVID-19:<a href=""https://t.co/McvEVoyC5x""><a href=""https://t.co/McvEVoyC5x"">https://t.co/McvEVoyC5x</a></a></p>&mdash; Barr Foundation (@BarrFdn) <a href=""https://twitter.com/BarrFdn/status/1276220633064636422?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">June 25, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script></p>

<p>At the same time, we are deploying grants to help organizations and communities that are ready to start this rebuilding work. For example, <a href=""https://blog.mass.gov/transportation/massdot-highway/massdot-announces-funding-program-to-help-cities-and-towns-create-shared-streets-and-spaces/"">a partnership with the <strong>Massachusetts Department of Transportation</strong></a> is offering local governments with technical assistance and funding to reorient their street and sidewalk space to meet needs related to physical distancing. This type of program helps jumpstart the economy by providing space for outdoor dining and commerce as well as gets people thinking differently about how much public space is allocated to people, rather than cars. It’s the type of partnership we’re excited about because it responds to our communities’ immediate needs while opening the door to longer-term solutions that work for people, support small businesses, and are good for the environment.</p>

<p>The reimagining and rebuilding work will lead us to support efforts that discourage a return to old paradigms. The potential is enormous, and COVID-19 has shown us that elected and community leaders can respond and transform systems quickly, and that we can all make changes that protect and strengthen our communities. Even in the midst of this challenging moment, our partners are inspiring us to be bold and to create a more sustainable and resilient future - one that centers communities that have borne for too long the high costs of the tired, old ways of doing energy and transportation.</p>"
722,Barr Awards $1.36 Million to Nonprofits Supporting Black Communities in Response to COVID-19,<p>The Foundation’s third set of grants in response to the pandemic focuses on organizations serving Black communities.</p>,"<p>In Massachusetts and our neighboring states, the trendlines for COVID-19 are currently moving in the right direction. Yet, the impacts in our communities have been profound and will be felt for some time. As a result, the Barr Foundation continues listening to our partners and local leaders and using data to understand where needs are greatest. We have seen the disproportionate impacts of the pandemic on low-income communities, immigrants, and people of color, and have prioritized Barr’s COVID-19 response grantmaking in support of these populations. In Massachusetts, Black and Hispanic residents have experienced <a href=""https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/06/19/nation/new-data-states-coronavirus-cases-deaths-show-stark-racial-divide/"">more than three times the rate of positive cases</a> as white residents.</p>

<p>Today, I am pleased to announce new grantmaking from Barr of $1.36 million to 19 organizations that specifically serve Black communities and are on the front lines helping them grapple with the pandemic. Many are also Black-led nonprofits.</p>

<ul>
<li>Arise, Inc. dba Arise for Social Justice ($60,000)</li>

<li>Women of Color in Solidarity ($25,000, <em>Fiscal Sponsor is Press Pass TV dba Transformative Culture Project</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p>As an extension of our earlier support for immigrant-serving organizations, we are also awarding $50,000 to Immigrant Family Services Institute, Inc.</p>
<h3>New grants are focused on core support.</h3>
<p>Most of these organizations have established COVID-19 relief funds that make resources available directly to community members and/or that augment services to Black communities. Most of these grants are for core support, and some funding also supports new advocacy efforts, as several of these organizations have shifted to work on policy and system changes to address some of the underlying inequities that COVID-19 has revealed so starkly.</p>

<p>These new grants build on two prior rounds of COVID-19 response grantmaking that totaled $4.6 million: a first to <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/investing-resources-and-offering-flexibility"">relief funds established by a number of community foundations across Massachusetts</a>, and a second to support <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/barr-commits-2-million-to-immigrant-serving-organizations"">immigrant-serving organizations addressing community needs</a> created by COVID-19.</p>
<h3>Beyond COVID-19, Barr’s commitment will endure.</h3>
<p>We realize that the work of combatting systemic inequities and structural racism requires long-term commitment to listening, learning, and investing in leaders of color and nonprofits working most proximately to the communities they serve.<blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--inequities""> <p>systemic</p> </blockquote> At Barr, we are committed to this work because it is inextricably linked to our central goals of creating vibrant, culturally rich, engaged communities; ensuring all young people can access high-quality schools; and advancing solutions for a changing climate.</p>

<p>In the coming weeks, I will share more detail on how the confluence of COVID-19 and our nation’s reckoning with anti-Black racism is accelerating work at Barr to focus our philanthropy more explicitly on the imperative of promoting racial equity in advancing our program goals.</p>"
719,New Support Available to Massachusetts Schools Planning for 2020-21 School Year,<p>Timely support for school and system leaders navigating COVID19 and centering their 2020-21 planning in equity.</p>,"<p>As Barr’s president, Jim Canales, noted in <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/actions-words"">his post last week</a>, the scourge of racism plaguing our country has been on full and tragic display. So has the failure of systems and structures meant to safeguard and secure the well-being, dignity, and potential of each and every life. As heartbreaking and angering as it all is, it also compels action. For those of us working in education, who know every student deserves a high-quality school, and that all young people can succeed in learning, work, and life, this moment makes clear that we must continue to center our work on equity. </p>

<p>In the context of COVID19, school and system leaders are also working to bring this radically-disrupted school year to a close. At the same time, they are embarking on the complex work of planning and building readiness for the 2020-21 school year – without fully knowing all that state health and education leaders will require.</p>

<p>While we remain committed to the ongoing and long-term work to create transformative educational experiences for every student, we know that how schools navigate these next few months will be critical. This is why we are offering new, targeted support to assist with that responsibility.</p>

<p>Recognizing that many would value expert guidance as they plan for re-opening, the Barr Foundation is partnering with <a href=""http://www.catalyst-ed.org"">Catalyst:Ed</a> to launch the <a href=""http://www.catalyst-ed.org/ma-ready/"">Massachusetts Ready Fund</a>. This new fund will link eligible public schools in Massachusetts with timely, expert support (at no cost to them) from a national network of vetted school support providers.</p>

<p>Funds can be applied across areas including academics, student support, social and emotional learning, student and family experience, talent, IT and operations, finance, equity-centered leadership, and more. Our intention is to help schools address questions, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>What plans need to be in place to best support all students as schools prepare for summer and for the 2020-21 school year amidst uncertainty? </li>
<li>What instructional approaches are needed to ensure equitable, high-quality learning, and how should teachers be supported in adopting these approaches? </li>
<li>How might we ensure all students and families are engaged and cared for as they navigate these tough times? </li>
<li>How can leaders and educators center equity as they make these decisions?</li>
</ul>

<p>Those seeking funds complete a brief online questionnaire, then work with Catalyst:Ed to clarify priority needs, scope a project, and select a provider. Catalyst:Ed will then handle all contracting and payments.</p>

<p>The current upheaval in our country gives even greater urgency to the imperative that all students can access educational options that prepare them to thrive in school, career, and in their communities. As we all navigate this difficult moment, we hope that urgency accelerates progress on school designs that support all students to be successful.</p>

<p>With a deep and abiding commitment to students and families, we look forward to continued partnership in collective action and learning to make that vision real.</p>"
718,Actions > Words,"<p>In another moment of shared tragedy, profound sadness and anger, we must act.</p>","<p>There is no denying that the scourge of racism continues to plague our country.</p>

<p>The murders of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, George Floyd in Minnesota, and Breonna Taylor in Kentucky remain far too familiar. In the first two instances, we know their names and their stories because there is video evidence of the heinous actions leading to their deaths. As many have asked whenever such horrific incidents occur: how many of these acts happen sight unseen?</p>

<p>Last week, we also saw the viral video of the disturbing confrontation in Central Park between Amy Cooper, a white woman walking her dog, and Christian Cooper, an African-American bird watcher. The exchange captured her instinctive willingness to render a false accusation about an African-American man to the police, after being rightly called out by Mr. Cooper for violating park rules to keep dogs leashed.</p>

<p>Let’s call it for what it is: at the center of each of these incidents is racism, plain and simple. So, what are we to do?
<blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--it""> <p>call</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>For those who have experienced racism on a consistent basis and seen this cycle play out far too many times, it is all so exhausting.</p>

<p>Of course, we can condemn and lament. Yet, actions always speak louder than words. I know my words in a blog post matter little. What matters is what we now choose to <em>do</em>.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, I wrote about <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/barr-equity-journey"">“Barr’s Equity Journey”</a> and the long-term work we have been engaged in to more fully integrate diversity, inclusion, and equity in our work.</p>

<p>At Barr, what we <em>do</em> must continue to be shaped and influenced by the disproportionate effects of COVID on communities of color, the continued racist actions toward African-Americans in particular, and the existence of policies and structures that systematically oppress people of color, immigrants and others who are, put simply, not white. </p>

<p>Centering our work on equity runs through every facet of Barr’s work. Through our Education program, we support the fundamental redesign of high schools so that they create opportunities for students left behind by our current system. We advocate for climate policies that not only reduce greenhouse gases but address the inequitable impacts of our old ways of doing things. We advance arts and creativity that lift up the full breadth of our diversity and help us imagine a more equitable future.</p>

<p>As we redouble these efforts, we interrogate what it means to put equity at the center, to keep examining the systemic causes of inequities, and to advance the fundamental changes we need. For us, asking these questions is central to our mission, is rooted in our values, and is essential to how we mark progress.</p>

<p>We commit to this long-term work and, more importantly, to the actions that render these words real. We also stand in solidarity with our partners and all who continue to work tirelessly to create a more equitable and just world.</p>

<p>The tragic events gripping our country right now make it clear how much more work there is to do, how necessary it is for all of us to engage, and the urgency of converting intention into action.</p>

716,Navigating through a Pandemic,<p>An update on Barr’s continuing COVID-19 response efforts.</p>,"<p>In the context of daunting challenges and continuing uncertainty about the course of this pandemic and its implications for our communities, I find myself returning to the adage:</p>

<p><em>“We cannot direct the wind, but we can adjust the sails.”</em></p>

<p>In that spirit, I wanted to share the latest on how we, at the Barr Foundation, have been adapting our efforts in this new context.</p>

<p>We don’t know when this difficult period will end or what awaits on the other side. But the key question guiding our response at Barr right now is: how can that other side be better than what we left behind?</p>

<p>Many have rightly noted that this pandemic has laid bare vast inequities in our society, and we have a rare opportunity now to ensure that we do not merely repair the broken systems that perpetuate such inequities. Rather, we must seize the opportunity to build something better for future generations.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--seize""> <p>must</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>This is our focus at Barr in response to the pandemic: supporting the work of rebuilding and reimagining in ways that are more just, equitable, inclusive, and fair. Here’s some of what we are doing:</p>
<h3>Supporting immediate needs and communities on the front lines of COVID-19</h3>
<p>To date, Barr has announced <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/covid-19"">$4.6 million in emergency response grantmaking</a>. This includes contributions to two emergency response funds in Boston, and to other pooled funds established by a set of Massachusetts community foundations. We also provided unrestricted resources to Massachusetts organizations serving immigrant populations on the front lines of the pandemic. We remain in active dialogue with funding colleagues throughout the region to explore other targeted and complementary opportunities to help address immediate needs.</p>
<h3>Adapting program priorities in response to grantee needs and our new context</h3>
<p>Across Barr, we have sought to be responsive to our current grantees, especially those whose work has been significantly impacted by COVID-19. In <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/a-message-to-our-grantees-on-covid-19"">my first message to Barr&#39;s grantees</a>, I outlined the changes we made to extend new flexibility and support. We will continue these practices for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>The pandemic has also required us to revisit plans across our core programs of Arts &amp; Creativity, Climate, and Education, as well as our work in Sector Effectiveness and the Waterfront Initiative. While we remain focused on the ambitious goals outlined in each area, we must also account for new realities.</p>

<p>Accordingly, our program teams have been in ongoing conversations with our many partners about what they are experiencing and seeing, and what the most urgent needs and opportunities are. This will be the subject of our trustee meeting in June, and in the weeks to come, our program directors will share more details on our blog about how the larger context is influencing our priorities. Much of this thinking has been—and will continue to be—shaped by ongoing discussions with our many partners, and we are grateful to all of you who have deepened our understanding of a changed context.</p>
<h3>Affirming Barr’s commitments for 2020 and 2021</h3>
<p>For 2020, Barr had planned on awarding $95 million in new grants—our largest allocation ever. We remain committed to that level of giving, at a minimum, for 2020. We are also initiating our planning for 2021, and I can report that Barr intends to sustain this level of grantmaking as a baseline for the year ahead, regardless of the economic impact on our endowment.</p>
<h3>Extending virtual operations</h3>
<p>Guided by values that emphasize health and safety of our employees and visitors as paramount, we have decided to sustain remote operations at least through Labor Day (September 7). Later this summer, we will develop plans for the gradual reopening of our offices, based on the latest guidance from public health experts and local and state government officials.</p>

<p>We have also suspended all business travel and in-person meetings, whether internal or external, until mid-September. It is possible that we will extend both remote operations and travel/meeting prohibitions beyond Labor Day, and we will keep you apprised.</p>

<p>As we have done since closing the office on March 13, we will continue regular operations at the Foundation. We have learned over the past two months that the vast majority of what we do at Barr can be sustained in a virtual environment. We, of course, miss the opportunities to be with our partners in person, whether at our offices or at your sites, and we look forward to resuming those in-person connections when it is prudent and safe to do so.</p>
<h3>In closing</h3>
<p>Like many of you, I have spent the vast majority of my time in these past two months in my home. Despite the physical separation, I remain heartened and buoyed by the many Zoom meetings, phone conversations, and email exchanges with our partners on the ground in communities across the region. The fact that so many have stepped up to this moment—in tireless, selfless, and courageous ways—has been extraordinary. My colleagues and I remain inspired by your dedication and grateful for your partnership.</p>"
715,Barr Commits $2 Million to Immigrant-Serving Organizations,<p>Newest grants in response to COVID-19 focus on supporting Massachusetts’ immigrant communities.</p>,"<p>So many of those on the front lines of COVID-19 are immigrants. They are our physicians and health care workers. They are staffing essential roles at grocery stores, pharmacies, and delivery services. In these roles and many more, immigrants are contributing significantly to helping our society continue to function right now. And they are also bearing the risks of COVID-19 in disproportionate numbers.   </p>

<p>Indeed, the more we learn about the impacts of COVID-19, the more apparent it becomes that the coronavirus is a revealer and magnifier of inequity. Today’s Boston Globe included <a href=""https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/04/15/nation/chelseas-spike-covid-19-cases-challenges-hospitals-state/"">a front-page story</a> describing the disproportionate impact of the virus on the city of Chelsea, where the infection rate is the highest in the state.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--contributing""> <p>are</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>It is this reality that informs the Barr Foundation’s next round of grants in response to COVID-19. Today, we announce 23 grants totaling $2 million to the following organizations serving immigrant communities in Massachusetts:</p>

<ul>
<li>African Community Education Program ($50,000)</li>
<li>Berkshire Immigrant Center ($50,000, <em>Fiscal Sponsor is the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, Inc.</em>)</li>
<li>Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center, Inc. ($100,000)</li>
<li>Brazilian Immigrant Center, Inc. ($75,000)</li>
<li>Catholic Social Services of Fall River, Inc. ($50,000)</li>
<li>Centro Comunitario de Trabajadores, Inc. ($50,000)</li>
<li>Centro Presente, Inc. ($75,000)</li>
<li>Chelsea Collaborative, Inc. ($125,000)</li>
<li>East Boston Ecumenical Community Council ($50,000)</li>
<li>Greater Boston Immigrant Defense Fund ($200,000, <em>Fiscal Sponsor is the Massachusetts Legal Assistance Corporation</em>) </li>
<li>GreenRoots, Inc. ($125,000)<br></li>
<li>Inquilinos Boricuas en Accion, Inc. ($100,000)</li>
<li>Justice at Work, Inc. ($50,000)</li>
<li>Lawyers for Civil Rights, Inc. ($150,000)</li>
<li>Massachusetts Census Equity Fund ($25,000, <em>Fiscal Sponsor is Philanthropy Massachusetts, Inc.</em>)</li>
<li>Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, Inc. ($150,000)</li>
<li>Massachusetts Law Reform Institute, Inc. ($75,000)</li>
<li>Neighbor to Neighbor Massachusetts Education Fund, Inc. ($75,000)</li>
<li>Political Asylum Immigration Representation Project, Inc. ($75,000)</li>
<li>Rian Immigrant Center, Inc. ($150,000)</li>
<li>Sociedad Latina, Inc. ($100,000)</li>
<li>Southeast Asian Coalition of Central Massachusetts, Inc. ($50,000)</li>
<li>The Islamic Society of Boston ($50,000)</li>
</ul>

<p>We know that organizations working most closely with our immigrant communities have been overwhelmed. Deluged with requests as human needs have grown, they have expanded services, even as new challenges to their own organizational health have emerged.</p>

<p>These grants are fully unrestricted and will be paid out immediately. We hope these resources, along with others that are being contributed, can enable these critical organizations to remain stable at a time when they are needed most.</p>

<p>This new grantmaking builds on support Barr was able to provide to many of these same organizations as part of a <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/supporting-new-england-communities-under-threat-and-ensuring-a-fair-and-accurate-census-count"">2017-18 special initiative</a>, and it follows the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/investing-resources-and-offering-flexibility"">$2.6 million in grants we announced earlier this month</a> to a set of community foundations and other pooled funds to augment emergency response funds that have been created in communities across the state.</p>

<p>Barr’s $4.6 million in COVID-19-related grantmaking to date has been oriented towards immediate and urgent needs. While a significant commitment of resources, we know it is dwarfed by the level of need in our communities. This is why we have invested in organizations closest to those communities and most in touch with their needs. We trust our partners to make the best decisions about the use of these resources, and we have minimized process and paperwork, so that funds get to work as quickly as possible. That’s what matters most right now.</p>

<p>We also know that there is still significant work to come. At some point, we will emerge from this phase of emergency crisis response. We will turn our collective attention to recovery and to rebuilding.  Importantly, we will also have opportunities to reimagine our communities and, ideally in the process, to address the very inequities that this virus has laid bare.</p>

<p>This will be vital work for the Barr Foundation and our partners. To that end, we are committed to shifting the majority of our grantmaking this year to efforts that enable us to recover and rebuild as we continue to pursue our mission and priorities. We will have more to report on that in the weeks and months ahead, and we remain ever grateful to our many partners for the critical work they are doing in these challenging times.</p>"
711,We Welcome Your Feedback,<p>Barr’s Director of Learning and Evaluation describes three ways to share feedback with the Foundation.</p>,"<p>At the Barr Foundation, how we do our work is just as important as what we do. Candid feedback from grantees and potential grantees has helped us become more open to new ideas and new partners, build more effective partnerships, and ultimately, have greater impact.</p>

<p>Barr has utilized the Center for Effective Philanthropy’s (CEP’s) Grantee Perception Report (GPR) every few years to gather comprehensive, anonymous feedback, which has highlighted important areas for our focus and which we have <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/impact-learning/grantee-perception-report"">shared publicly</a>. However, that survey is a time intensive process for both grantees and Barr and is conducted only periodically. We want to ensure we are open to feedback at any time and hope to make it easy for our current and potential partners to provide timely feedback about their experiences interacting with the Barr Foundation.</p>

<p>We want to make you aware of several options for sharing feedback with us at any time:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Talk with us directly.</strong> We are always open to direct feedback by email, in person, or by phone. This is the most helpful form of feedback as it allows more discussion and a fuller understanding of the concern. But we do understand that it isn’t always feasible and the power dynamics inherent in a funding relationship can make it difficult to provide candid feedback in this way. </li>
<li><strong>Use our Grantmaking Process Feedback form.</strong> Current grantees or organizations that have submitted proposals can use our <a href=""https://www.tfaforms.com/4690005"">Grantmaking Process Feedback form</a> to provide comments on their experience. We want every organization or individual that seeks funding from Barr to feel that they were treated with respect and received a decision in a timely manner. Regardless of where you are in the process - whether you are currently receiving funding or not - we welcome your feedback. Each submission of this form is received and reviewed weekly by our Grants Management team, and this feedback is shared with our staff. Using this form, you can choose to include your contact information if you want us to follow up with you or submit feedback anonymously.</li>
<li><strong>Submit an anonymous public review on GrantAdvisor.</strong> We invite public reviews of the <a href=""https://grantadvisor.org/survey.php?ein=04-6579815"">Barr Foundation on GrantAdvisor</a>. Whether you have applied for a grant, received a grant, or interacted with our foundation in another way, this platform offers an opportunity to share an anonymous review based on your first-hand experience. As appropriate, we may also publicly acknowledge or respond to these reviews. We hope that this additional avenue for sharing feedback may help to level the inherent power dynamic between philanthropic organizations and empower those who seek funding to safely provide honest critique to help identify ways that Barr can improve and hold us publicly accountable for our decisions. </li>
</ul>

<p>Humility is a core value of the Barr Foundation, and this includes respect for our partners and recognition of the privilege inherent in philanthropic work. Feedback is a critical complement to other sources of data on our effectiveness as we strive for excellence in all aspects of our work. We look forward to hearing your ideas and suggestions.</p>"
710,Massachusetts Wants Climate Action and Leadership,<p>New poll shows majorities across demographic groups now see climate change as a serious problem if left unaddressed.</p>,"<p>From its earliest days, the Barr Foundation has counted the environment among its central priorities. In 2010, Barr focused its entire environmental portfolio on climate change. We recognized both the urgency of action and the abundant opportunities that Massachusetts, and our broader region had to advance solutions, and to play significant leading roles nationally and beyond.</p>

<p>To inform our approach, and as a resource to others who share these aims, that same year we partnered with The MassINC Polling Group, to give visibility to the level of awareness and concern people in Massachusetts had about climate change, its impact on their communities, and what – if anything – they wanted to see their elected leaders do about it.</p>

<p>The MassINC Polling Group released a first poll on these questions in 2011. And the Barr Foundation has been pleased to continue this partnership, to sustain visibility on these important questions, and to understand trends.</p>

<p>The MassINC Polling Group released findings from the newest edition of this poll just last week. Their report, <a href=""https://www.massincpolling.com/the-topline/2020/1/31/climate""><em>The Waters Around Us: Public opinion research on Massachusetts residents’ 
views on climate change</em></a>, provides the snapshot of a continuing trend - that Bay Staters are feeling an increasing urgency for climate action and leadership.</p>

<p>Above all, we are struck that 53% of respondents now say global warming is a high priority (up from just 32% as recently as 2011). What’s more, 79% characterize climate change as serious problem for Massachusetts, and are well aware of current and looming climate impacts—especially threats to public health and to low-income communities. Majorities also want to see more state leadership and policies that accelerate needed transformation. Support for greater investment in public transportation and offshore wind is particularly strong.</p>

<p>We encourage you to take a closer look at the full report, which can be found – along with slides from the release event, and full crosstabs of all data – on MassINC Polling Group’s “The Topline” blog via the button below.</p>

<p>Though we continue to see contrasts in opinion across age, gender, different parts of the state, types of communities, and political leanings, the long-term trends across all demographics are clear. And these bring to life what many of us see firsthand in our work every day—that people in all parts of Massachusetts recognize that responding to climate change is both a necessity and opportunity, and there is no time to lose.</p>"
676,The Critical Role of Teacher Leaders,"<p>New research offers framework to understand the many forms teacher leadership takes, and insights into the opportunities for educators in Massachusetts.</p>","<p>As part of the Invest in Educators portfolio, our Education team wanted to understand more about how teachers, school and system leaders think about the purpose and power of teacher leadership while mapping the current landscape of teacher leadership opportunities within Massachusetts.</p>

<p>In addition to engaging the expertise of our grantees, we worked with <a href=""https://education-first.com/"">Education First</a> to incorporate national research on approaches to teacher leadership with the perspectives and reality of the landscape of opportunities for teacher leaders in Massachusetts. That research identified a few themes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Multiple forms.</strong> Teacher leadership takes many forms. Opportunities may support teachers to expand their sphere of influence and/or deepen their work directly with students. (e.g., teacher leaders may have additional responsibilities that allow them to share their expertise with more students or educators, or teacher leaders may be supported to gain more expertise and skills to allow them to directly impact student learning in new ways in a school or across a system.)</li>
<li><strong>Opportunities &amp; Pathways.</strong> Teachers do not have visibility into what leadership opportunities are available to them, and it is unclear how those opportunities may fit together to form career pathways for teachers.</li>
<li><strong>Commitment.</strong> Effective teacher leadership is an ongoing, critical component of high-quality schools. Thus, it must be supported by senior leadership with dedicated time, space, resources, and accountability.</li>
</ul>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--leadership""> <p>teacher</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>We are happy to share an overview of the project’s findings, including the framework below, which offers one way to organize the current landscape of opportunities for teacher leadership at the local or regional level.</p>

672,Innovation Is Everywhere,<p>Schools across the United States are leading change from within. Why don’t we know more about them?</p>,"<p><em>Originally published in <a href=""https://www.edweek.org/education-industry/opinion-stop-ignoring-the-innovation-that-happens-in-traditional-public-schools/2019/11"">Education Week</a> under the title, &quot;Stop Ignoring the Innovation That Happens in Traditional Public Schools.&quot; Reprinted with permission from the authors.</em></p>

<p>When students at Childersburg Middle School head to the library, there&#39;s far more to do than read a book. Two summers ago, their teachers divided the space into a cozy reading area and the &quot;GRID,&quot; a hands-on engineering lab where students work in groups and learn through the process of design. Back in their regular classrooms, teachers guide projects that build on that learning, and that continues online at home.</p>

<p>Though Childersburg sounds like an independent school with lots of freedom and funding, it is actually a traditional public school in rural Alabama. What&#39;s going on there is showing how teachers and students in a variety of district public schools are embracing innovation. But we&#39;ve only just recently learned about Childersburg through <a href=""https://www.christenseninstitute.org/canopy-project/"">the Canopy project</a>, a new effort by the Clayton Christensen Institute to identify promising practices in schools across the United States that have, to date, largely escaped notice.</p>

<p>As program officers at three national education foundations, we know that educators everywhere are making big changes in teaching and learning. But the education community—funders like us, along with state and federal decision-makers, district and school leaders, researchers, and advocates—has not had a ready source of detailed information about innovators outside established networks or major urban centers. As a result, only a few schools gain widespread attention, and models that are relevant to educators working in a variety of contexts remain under the radar.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--officers""> <p>program</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>That inspired our support of Canopy, which invites local educators and education experts to nominate their peers for inclusion in a detailed registry of innovation. Canopy has introduced us to schools like Stilwell High School in Oklahoma, where students combine academics with internships and career-readiness coursework, and Barrington Middle School in Rhode Island, where teachers serve as mentors and students design and complete collaborative projects. This group of 235 schools, nearly three-quarters of which had never before appeared on well-known lists or databases, is helping those of us working at a national level look beyond the familiar and better understand how widespread new practices have become.</p>

<p>Such understanding is critical for our roles as grantmakers. While we fund a narrow fraction of education overall, the programs we support tend to attract attention and visibility, including the research that can determine which programs enhance student success.</p>

<p>From our perspective as funders, four key lessons stand out:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Innovation is happening all across the country</strong>, not in a few niche corners as we are sometimes led to believe. The Canopy project has identified change-making schools in urban, suburban, and rural communities in 34 states with the help of local and regional experts on the ground. </li>
<li>Also contrary to common assumption, <strong>most of this work is happening within public school districts.</strong> Even with a limited sample size, two-thirds of the schools identified in the Canopy project are traditional public schools.</li>
<li>Amid a wide range of new models, three approaches appear to have broad adoption: social-emotional learning, project-based learning, and building learner agency through practices like goal-setting. </li>
<li>Such <strong>practices are unevenly distributed across school locations and demographic profiles.</strong> For example, higher poverty schools and those serving higher percentages of students of color were less likely to report strategies such as experiential learning. While it&#39;s possible these data reflect the intentional decisions of schools aligned to local community priorities, it is equally plausible that some schools face more barriers to implementing these approaches than others. Clearly, we have more communities and questions to explore.</li>
</ul>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--also""> <p>insights</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Despite notable gains in states&#39; high school graduation rates and a larger and more diverse college-going population than decades past, far too many students lack access to an excellent school experience that supports their full development and prepares them to pursue their goals. By understanding how educators are making changes in their classrooms, we can share those discoveries and help schools to embrace promising new practices in a variety of contexts. These insights also can guide us to the critical next step: looking carefully at how these new models affect student outcomes across diverse environments.</p>

<p>We now know more than ever about what can foster a child&#39;s full potential, including relevant learning opportunities, personalized data-driven supports, the intentional development of social and emotional skills, and a supportive learning community where students feel that they belong. But no single model will work for every community. Schools need a range of proven strategies and a broader array of comparable schools from which they can learn. In lifting up diverse real-world examples from across the country, we can progress toward our ultimate goal: ensuring every school has a roadmap to support all students to succeed.</p>

639,Five Lessons Our Grantees Shared with Us in 2019,<p>Barr's Director of Learning and Evaluation shares five lessons learned from our partners in 2019.</p>,"<p>Listening is powerful. As a funder, we value curiosity and strive to be open to feedback and learning. I&#39;ve spent the first few weeks of this new year looking back at many of the interim and final reports submitted to Barr by our grantees in 2019. And I have been thinking about these alongside what we have learned through conversations, site visits, and formal evaluations last year.</p>

<p>We are always excited to hear about the progress they’re making and the milestones they’ve achieved, and I hope you will celebrate many of these through our <a href=""https://2019.barrfoundation.org/"">2019 Year in Review</a>. We also deeply appreciate their openness about challenges they’ve faced. I wanted to share five lessons that stood out to me across our work this year.</p>
<h3>1. Direct experience is particularly powerful.</h3>
<p>Many grantees noted that, without seeing solutions firsthand, it can be a struggle to generate demand for aspirational ideas. The opportunity to see new models and solutions at work is a powerful tactic to move from vision to action, and to transform skeptics into champions. We heard that logistics of learning and study trips are sometimes daunting, including finding the best places to visit and assembling the right group of participants. But they told us that the experiences were worth it. As C.A. Webb of the Kendall Square Association reflected in a <a href=""https://medium.com/@ca_webb/massachusetts-loves-history-lets-embrace-the-future-too-72b442ad1c00"">Medium</a> post after traveling to Oslo with a group of Massachusetts transportation sector leaders and <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/six-mobility-lessons-from-europes-most-sustainable-city"">members of Barr’s mobility team</a>, “Sometimes you have to leave home so you can see yourself and your home and all of its challenges and opportunities more clearly.”</p>
<h3>2. When transferring good ideas from one place to another, tread carefully.</h3>
<p>Barr often supports grantees seeking to bring innovative ideas to new places. Numerous grantees shared with us about the pitfalls and challenges in this work – for example, the importance of taking time to understand local conditions and the all-too-human tendency to notice similarities and miss key differences. Our grantees reminded us of the important lesson about paying close attention to context and the need to adapt to local conditions. For example, in reflecting on the work to advance transit-oriented development outside Boston, <a href=""https://massinc.org/"">MassINC</a> noted,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“…many of the findings in Boston-centric studies do not apply to regional cities… High levels of youth, entrepreneurs, and aging populations … require better information about mobility, accessibility, and connection to services, education opportunities, housing, and social/cultural events in the cities and surrounding communities.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ground truthing assumptions when expanding one’s reach in new geographies is also a lesson we try to keep in mind at Barr as we have grown our grantmaking across New England. </p>
<h3>3. Leadership transitions, pipelines, and succession planning are critical.</h3>
<p>Across the social sector, strong leadership is commonly acknowledged as critical to any effort. Many grantees related instances where they were challenged by leadership transitions, and by the work of diversifying their staff and leadership to better reflect their constituents. As our partners at <a href=""https://buildingmovement.org/"">Building Movement Project</a> reflected, “…Over the past year we have learned how much having a multiracial team is key to our ability to carry out our research agenda.” From many of our grantees, we heard about the inherent difficulties in maintaining strategic focus amidst leadership transitions as well as the importance of having pipelines and succession plans for all key staff, not just for executive directors. Grantees also shared the challenges they faced in increasing staff and board diversity, in building a deeper bench, and in transitioning to new and more adaptive models of leadership.</p>
<h3>4. Without new narratives, messages about solutions may fall flat.</h3>
<p>Knowing what works and simply sharing that news isn’t enough. Many of our grantees work hard to validate the effectiveness of new models or to research promising solutions; however, effectively reaching a wide audience and raising their awareness isn’t easy. Our grantees emphasized to us that good news doesn’t travel far in the face of negative, outdated, or unhelpful narratives. We heard stories across many domains of grantees who found it helpful to engage in research to more deeply understand key audiences so they could effectively present new information in ways that resonate with them. Without this foundational work, positive news could not find fertile ground. For example, in reflecting on their work in Boston, the Conservation Law Foundation shared, “A critical lesson learned is that we needed to build a solid foundation of storytelling, journey mapping, and solid narratives via earned media, opinion pieces, and grassroots social media to build a base before creating and distributing more robust content (i.e., message focus groups, polling, explainer videos, infographics, and other visual content).”</p>
<h3>5. It takes time and trust to build diverse coalitions for durable systems-level change.</h3>
<p>Many of Barr’s grantees engage in systems-level work that requires collaboration of multiple actors across a network. Several pointed to polarization and a shifting policy landscape as factors that have made their work more complex. Others reflected on the patience and persistence required to build enduring coalitions. An education grantee noted that, “building relationships takes time. Authentic relationships built on trust require extensive outreach and effective organizers who are able to break down misperceptions through conversations.” Another pointed out that this work requires, “focusing on the substance rather than the noise, and working to recruit additional partners and authentically represent the communities we are focused on serving.</p>

<p>We want to acknowledge the time and thought it takes to share these kinds of reflections, and what a gift they are. We seek to learn from and with our grantee partners, which is critical to helping us achieve together the goals we share.</p>"
638,New England Students and Parents Expect More from High School,<p>New poll reveals large gaps between what parents and students want and what their high schools currently provide.</p>,"<p>Barr’s Education Program is committed to listening to those who are at the center of our work: students who are eager to learn and grow, families who desire an excellent education for their children, and teachers and principals who support students to be successful in and beyond high school. This is why Barr partnered earlier this year with Beacon Research, a Boston-based market and opinion research firm. We wanted to build understanding of how high school students, parents, teachers and principals across New England feel about their high schools, and their ideas and priorities for improving learning experiences.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--to""> <p>wanted</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Beacon Research’s poll was administered online and via telephone (in English and Spanish) and ultimately generated 2,500 responses from across New England from current high school students and recent graduates, parents of high school students, high school teachers, and high school principals. The <a href=""https://barrfdn.issuelab.org/resource/perspectives-on-high-school-education-in-new-england"">complete findings are now available on Barr’s Knowledge Center</a>. In this post, we wanted to highlight four of the findings we were particularly struck by. They reveal a dissonance between what students and parents see as critical for success after high school and what their high schools currently provide:</p>
<h3>Finding #1: Core academic content ranks lowest among skills that student and parents value upon high school graduation</h3>
<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3252/small.png?1642126673 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3252/medium.png?1642126673 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3252/large.png?1642126673 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3252/x_large.png?1642126673 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""Education polling data graph 1"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3252/small.png?1642126673"" /> </div> </div></p>

<p>Why is it that students and parents are not prioritizing the importance of learning and engaging with academic content? The data behind Finding #2 could be one reason. </p>
<h3>Finding #2: Students are not satisfied with how their high school experience is connected to life after school.</h3>
<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3254/small.png?1642126680 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3254/medium.png?1642126680 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3254/large.png?1642126680 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3254/x_large.png?1642126680 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""Education Polling Data Graph 3"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3254/small.png?1642126680"" /> </div> </div></p>

<p>A majority of students surveyed place high value on experiences that allow them to navigate opportunities and challenges that await beyond graduation. This includes exploring college and career paths, discovering their interests, deepening their expertise, and learning from local businesses and the community. Less than half of students believe that their school is delivering these opportunities well; and this relates to another key disconnect:</p>
<h3>Finding #3: Principals and students have different perspectives on how well high school is delivering on what matters most to students.</h3>
<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3262/small.png?1642126704 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3262/medium.png?1642126704 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3262/large.png?1642126704 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3262/x_large.png?1642126704 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""Education Polling Graph 3 take 2"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3262/small.png?1642126704"" /> </div> </div></p>

<p>Almost all of the principals surveyed would give their school an A or B grade on how well they are doing delivering on critical elements of high school. Students do not agree. Only about half of the students surveyed think their high schools are providing these experiences well.   Finally, the data shows that there is appetite, from students and parents, to see the high school experience transformed so that success is within reach of all students.</p>
<h3>Finding #4: Roughly 80% of students and parents believe schools need to change to provide better education for students.</h3>

<p>Barr’s Education Program is rooted in the belief that all students can graduate high school fully prepared to thrive in college, career, and life. However, we have a long way to go to make this a reality for all students. Grantees in our Catalyze New Models portfolio work across New England to design and implement high schools that put success within reach for all students. Their experiences have taught us that the best solutions are deeply informed by the interests, experiences, and aspirations of the students and families they serve. And, in order to bring those new school models to life, teachers and school leaders must be deeply committed and aligned around a common vision.</p>

<p>In order to move forward in developing that vision of high quality high schools that put success within reach for all students, we all must listen to how students feel about their experiences in school today. We can learn a lot about what might need to change.</p>

<p>In this post, we have only pulled out some of the rich perspectives heard through the poll, and we invite you to explore the data further. You can locate the <a href=""https://barrfdn.issuelab.org/resource/perspectives-on-high-school-education-in-new-england"">full set of data on Barr’s Knowledge Center</a>, and we invite you to share your insights via the comments section below or by emailing our team at <a href=""mailto:education@barrfoundation.org"">education@barrfoundation.org</a>.</p>

637,14 New England Communities to Build a “Portrait of a Graduate”,<p>What do our students need to know and be able to do by the time they graduate high school?</p>,"<p>In June 2019, we released an RFP for communities to build a locally-driven “portrait of a graduate” – a collective vision of high school graduates who are prepared for post-secondary success. Today, we are excited to announce grants to a cohort of 14 communities representing 60 high schools across New England.</p>

<p>Why a portrait of a graduate? At Barr, we believe that all students are capable of success. In order for schools to successfully educate all students for the realities of our rapidly changing world, communities must construct a new understanding of what school could look like. That’s where a portrait of a graduate can help. A portrait of a graduate articulates the vision of what all high school students will know and be able to do in order to succeed in college, career, and the community.</p>

<p>This diverse group of partners spans urban and rural communities across four states, and includes single school sites, multiple schools working together within one school system, and regional approaches of schools working together across systems. Of particular importance, these schools represent a composite rate of at least 50% high needs learners, a key step to ensuring that these visions of success prioritize students who have traditionally been underserved by school systems. Across these different contexts, all 14 communities have demonstrated a deep commitment to collectively visioning new possibilities for their high schools.</p>

<p>The 14 grantees are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Berkshires Tomorrow Inc.</li>
<li>Boston Preparatory Charter Public School</li>
<li>The Boston Higher Education Resource Center</li>
<li>Consolidated School District of New Britain</li>

<p>The portrait of a graduate process will result in a roadmap to drive change and align ongoing work in these 14 communities’ high schools. The process is community-led and includes students, families, school staff members, and committed partners in higher education, local employers, and others. From January-December 2020, each of the 14 grantees will bring these groups together at the planning table to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Examine graduates’ readiness for college and career.</li>
<li>Review existing student outcome frameworks.</li>
<li>Identify knowledge and skills all graduates will attain.</li>
<li>Develop an action plan for using a portrait of a graduate to advance student outcomes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Throughout the yearlong grant period, our partner <a href=""https://agenda4learning.com/"">The Learning Agenda</a> will support the Portrait of a Graduate grantees through a cohort learning community. The learning community is both an opportunity for peer learning as well as for infusing knowledge from national experts.</p>

<p>We are excited to support and learn from communities as they begin deep planning and visioning for what they want for their students, and engage in new thinking about what the high school experience can be. We will share our learning throughout the year and invite you to follow our journey through updates on our new Catalyze New Models <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/catalyze-new-models"">strategy page</a> and join the conversation on social media via <a href=""https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DoingHSdifferently&src=typed_query"">#DoingHSdifferently</a>.</p>"
632,Diverse Group of Leaders Advance United Vision to Transform Massachusetts’ Transportation System,"<p>At a moment of crisis, business, municipal, and nonprofit leaders find common ground in call for bold action to address urgent challenges. </p>","<p>The Commonwealth’s transportation system has reached a full-on crisis. Massachusetts now has the distinction of having the worst congestion in the country. Many of our roads and bridges don’t meet federal safety standard. Almost all of the T&#39;s trains are over 40 years old and rely on technologies from a century ago. Simply put, our transportation system has become a daily pain point in our lives.</p>

<p>Recognizing this crisis and the urgency of action, a group of approximately 20 leaders from business, government, and nonprofits – people who don’t always sit at the same table - came together late this summer and into the fall. Barr engaged as a convener and provided support to the Consensus Building Institute to facilitate these important discussions. Indeed, anytime a disparate set of actors come together to shape new solutions to longstanding challenges, it’s important to support that process. Barr also funded the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation to conduct new research, including gathering ideas and priorities from previous transportation reports, in order to synthesize much of this important work into a cohesive document that all were willing to support.</p>

<p>After spirited deliberations and lively debate, this group, now known as The Transportation Table (or “T3”), released a set of recommendations early this week that promises to transform our transportation system.</p>
<h3>The Vision</h3>
<p>What would a transformed transportation system mean for Massachusetts residents? It means that no matter where a person lives, they have good options to get where they need to go. It’s a system that is accessible, reliable, affordable, resilient to climate change, and fueled by clean energy. It’s a fully modernized rail system; dramatically improved bus service; and good roads, bridges, bike paths, and sidewalks. People will choose to drive less because their public transit options are so good.</p>

<p>We encourage you to review T3&#39;s ambitious document in full.</p>

<p class=""tyler"">Five Recommendations to Make Our Move on Transportation<a href=""https://medium.com/@thetransportationtable/five-recommendations-to-make-our-move-on-transportation-c0eb00b7f67b%22%5D"">https://medium.com/@thetransportationtable/five-recommendations-to-make-our-move-on-transportation-c0eb00b7f67b&quot;]</a></p>
<h3>The Recommendations</h3>
<p>As longtime funders in the mobility space, we applaud T3’s efforts and are inspired by the boldness of their recommendations. All participants in the T3 process have agreed upon and signed off on a series of actions that fall into five major categories the state must address. At a high-level, these are:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Governance</strong> – Restore confidence and trust in the systems that manage transportation. For starters, T3 recommends a permanent, independent, and accountable MBTA governing board. </li>
<li><strong>Congestion</strong> – Use pricing policy to reduce traffic congestion, and invest funds into transit that will incentivize fewer cars on the road. This includes new tolls and fees, but also services and benefits from employers. </li>
<li><strong>Capacity</strong> – Build the capacity of public agencies to carry out capital projects, including staffing and better partnerships and bidding procedures. </li>
<li><strong>Climate</strong> – Reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions and make our infrastructure resilient to climate impacts. This includes converting cars and buses to electric vehicles, electrifying trains, and upgrading infrastructure for climate impacts.</li>
<li><strong>Investment</strong> – Dedicate more revenue now and in the future to accelerate investment in transportation services and infrastructure. </li>
</ol>

<p>It is important to note that the five interventions included in the T3 document reinforce each other, and therefore need to happen concurrently. For example, without good governance, we won’t have the transparency and accountability necessary to instill public confidence. We cannot alleviate traffic without dramatically overhauling our public transit system. And, in a world where three feet of snow and storm surges are becoming the norm, we have a responsibility to make sure that our transportation system can withstand climate shocks, and that it doesn’t remain the largest contributor of greenhouse gases in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>More than a list of suggestions, this document offers an impressive vision and blueprint for achieving a 21st century transportation system, one that keeps our economy strong, reduces emissions, and gets us where we need to go. Notably, all participants agreed on three core conclusions: (1) Massachusetts needs public transit to be the backbone of our transportation system; (2) The transportation system currently does not have sufficient funds to address our needs – both today and tomorrow. We have a revenue gap that needs to be filled; and (3) Actions should focus on infrastructure projects and transit services that people can actually experience within the next one to five years.</p>

<p>T3 members are under no illusion that this transformation will happen overnight. Yet their recommendations are no distant pipe dream either. T3’s plan will deliver noticeable improvements in people’s lives within one to five years, while also fulfilling a longer-term vision for a future transportation system that Massachusetts’ residents deserve. </p>
<h3>What&#39;s Next?</h3>
<p>T3 has submitted its recommendations to members of the Legislature and the Governor’s administration, and are currently disseminating it broadly to their various constituencies as well. The group believes strongly that we all have a role to play – and we must act now.</p>

<p>One clear takeaway from this moment of crisis is that in crisis, there is opportunity. Our transportation system impacts all of us. We’re all in this together. And it’s our move to get engaged, and to demand a system that works for everyone.</p>

631,Expanding Access to the Arts in Rural Berkshire County,<p>How nonprofits and residents are confronting barriers to participation in an arts-rich region through the Arts Build Community Initiative.</p>,"<p>Two years ago, <a href=""https://www.berkshiretaconic.org/default.aspx"">Berkshire Taconic Community Foundation</a> (BTCF) had just completed a <a href=""https://www.acloserlook.net/about/"">community assessment</a> of our four-county region. Through conversations and surveys of over 2,300 residents, our assessment surfaced a set of pressing issues. Importantly, we learned that the arts and the creative economy are widely considered key strengths we can build on together. At the same time, many observed that involvement in organizations is declining, while others reported feeling excluded from parts of community life. In this context, the opportunity to partner with the Barr Foundation and a group of community foundation peers through the Creative Commonwealth Initiative was timely.</p>

<p>This partnership became a chance for us to make a smart bet on Berkshire County’s future. By investing in organizations, people and learning, we believe we can use the proven power of the arts and the creative process to forge more engaged and equitable communities.</p>

<p><strong>Listening and Learning with Residents</strong></p>

<p>Our rural communities are changing. They are aging and becoming more diverse. Jobs in manufacturing and agriculture have been replaced by health care and social service jobs, and a flourishing creative economy. Affluent second homeowners and third-generation residents struggling to make ends meet show up at the same town meetings to voice different concerns.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--in""> <p>investing</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>As we zeroed in on the unifying strength of the arts and culture sector, we needed to learn more about the real and perceived barriers that get in the way of involvement. We funded a team of resident-researchers to conduct community-based participatory research in two of the county’s highest-poverty neighborhoods. Via surveys, interviews and focus groups, they reached a diverse sample of over 450 full-time residents. Their research produced a series of findings that inspire action, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Widespread interest in more arts and creativity</em>. Eighty percent of surveyed residents want to be more involved in the arts.</li>
<li><em>Many feel disconnected and excluded</em>. Only 1 in 5 respondents reported feeling connected to the arts, with people of color reporting comparatively lower rates of feeling included in the arts.</li>
<li>There are many barriers to greater participation. Sixty percent of respondents reported barriers to participating in the arts, with cost—or cost and a related concern such as transportation, time or lack of awareness—most frequently cited.</li>
</ul>

<p class=""tyler"">Learn more about the findings<a href=""https://www.berkshiretaconic.org/Portals/0/Arts%20Build%20Community%20overview%20and%20summary.pdf%22%5D"">https://www.berkshiretaconic.org/Portals/0/Arts%20Build%20Community%20overview%20and%20summary.pdf&quot;]</a></p>

<p>The researchers identified a constellation of other barriers related to social discomfort, including not feeling welcome, a lack of engaging cultural content, language access, and scarce family-friendly programs and audience diversity.</p>

<p><strong>Shaping the Initiative – Four Key Elements</strong></p>

<p>These research results drove our planning process, which resulted in the <a href=""https://www.berkshiretaconic.org/bLearnbAboutBTCF/StrategicPriorities/ArtsBuildCommunity.aspx"">Arts Build Community</a> (ABC) initiative. It combines research, grant support, network and capacity building, and donor engagement to increase levels of involvement in the arts and creative process among year-round residents and organizations. It is specifically focused on creating stronger connections among arts and community-based institutions and young people, people of color and immigrants, and low-income communities. ABC&#39;s four key elements are:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Increased Arts Grantmaking</em>: With grants totaling $200,000 to date, we are spurring innovation at dozens of organizations as they expand existing programs and collaborate to scale and launch new ones. Members of the research team help review grant applications and provide important perspective. The initial funding was awarded through BTCF’s first-ever rapid response grants. They went to organizations such as the Mahaiwe, a performing arts center aiming to bring underserved audiences to headlining performances, and MASS MoCA, a world-class contemporary arts museum that is forming a community advisory network to improve programming relevance. For a list of these grantees, <a href=""https://www.berkshiretaconic.org/bLearnbAboutBTCF/BTCFBlog/TabId/660/PostId/17/arts-build-community-initiative-awards-66000-in-first-grant-cycle.aspx"">visit our blog</a>. </li>
<li><em>Learning Networks</em>: A group of seven arts and culture nonprofits in Berkshire County are participating in a yearlong learning program investigating real and perceived barriers to involvement. It is designed to help them share promising ideas and experiment with new approaches based on concepts introduced by workshop leaders with deep content expertise. </li>
<li><em>Arts in Education</em>: BTCF and Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts have joined forces to lead a coalition of schools and nonprofits in shaping a common vision for arts education that will ensure equitable access to cultural resources for all students, increase the use of arts-based strategies in student learning and create paths to employment at cultural institutions.</li>
<li><em>New Arts Philanthropy</em>: We are bringing together donors who care about the arts for small, discussion-oriented events. As they hear from researchers, nonprofits and each other, they are seeing opportunities to pursue their interests while supporting their communities in new ways.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Early Learning and Aspirations</strong></p>

<p>By taking an inventory of the grant proposals, we gained a clearer sense of what grantees and our learning cohort hope to accomplish with our investments. Here are some high-level themes:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Expanding engagement</em>. The projects seek to engage under-represented residents through a broad spectrum of arts and culture disciplines and venues.<br></li>
<li><em>Leveraging partnerships and networks</em>. Most are collaborating with other organizations to implement their projects more effectively, thus demonstrating the power of partnerships and importance of networks.</li>
<li><em>Addressing barriers</em>. The research findings resonated strongly with grantees, and nearly every project is addressing barriers related to social discomfort in addition to challenges with cost, transportation and language access. </li>
<li><em>Access and inclusion</em>. Some grantees are expanding their scope to include other under-served residents, such as those with disabilities, older adults, LGBTQ people and those in our most remote rural areas.</li>
</ul>

<p>We are also inspired by the range of outcomes our partners seek.</p>

<p>At the individual level, they want diverse audience members to feel that they belong with other patrons in our county’s many venues; return visits and relationships with institutions are among the primary goals. For families, grantees hope to provide shared experiences in venues they might not normally visit. By creating these experiences among family members, they hope to motivate those families to return for meaningful time together. 
<blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--the""> <p>know</p> </blockquote>
As organizations, they seek to create programs and events that reflect diverse perspectives and experiences, while building a more economically and culturally diverse base of participants. And at the community level, our grantees are pursuing a vision of stronger coalitions and increased collaboration that will ultimately foster social cohesion.</p>

<p><strong>Moving Forward</strong></p>

<p>As a community foundation with a special vantage point on our region, we know the solutions to our challenges are all around us. They lie in the strength of our institutions and the ingenuity of our residents. Pursuing these solutions requires close examination of uncomfortable truths about our society and systems.

630,Barr Announces New Grants and Partnerships to Strengthen School Leadership in Massachusetts,<p>10 Massachusetts school systems will work together in a strategic planning process exploring the challenges and solutions to the principal pipeline.</p>,"<p>Earlier this year, we announced a new RFP for partnerships of schools to explore the challenges and solution to the principal pipeline. Today, we are excited to announce a partnership of four grants as part of the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/strengthen-school-leadership-rfp"">Strengthening School Leadership</a> cohort. These schools and systems demonstrate a commitment to explore all potential solutions to strengthening school leadership. This cohort represents diverse regions across the state, and includes:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://www.chelseaschools.com/cps/"">Chelsea Public Schools</a> in partnership with <a href=""https://maldenps.org/"">Malden Public Schools</a>, <a href=""http://www.reverek12.org/"">Revere Public Schools</a>, and <a href=""https://www.winthrop.k12.ma.us/"">Winthrop Public Schools</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://www.gardnerk12.org/"">Gardner Public Schools</a> in partnership with <a href=""https://www.fitchburg.k12.ma.us/"">Fitchburg Public Schools</a>, <a href=""https://www.leominsterschools.org/"">Leominster Public Schools</a>, and <a href=""https://www.winchendonk12.org/"">Winchendon Public Schools</a></li>

<li><a href=""http://www.springfieldempowerment.org/"">Springfield Empowerment Zone</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>Over the next 9 months, these districts and partnerships will embark on a planning process to understand what it will take to have a high-quality principal in each school. With technical assistance provided by <a href=""https://attunedpartners.com/"">Attuned Education Partners</a>, grantees will gain a deeper understanding of their local principal pipeline; gather important feedback and perspectives from local stakeholders; share findings and insights among each other; and develop a plan for a systematic leadership development approach. </p>
<h3>Background on this work:</h3>
<p>What will it take to ensure there is a high-quality principal in every school in Massachusetts? What are the key challenges and essential ingredients to strengthen the principalship and drive better outcomes for students – especially the students of color and English learners that the state is currently serving least well? Studies have consistently shown that the largest in-school factor in student learning, after teachers, is principals (see: “<a href=""https://www.wallacefoundation.org/knowledge-center/Documents/How-Leadership-Influences-Student-Learning.pdf"">How Leadership Influences Learning</a>,” a 2004 research review commissioned by the Wallace Foundation).</p>

<p>To answer these questions, the Barr Foundation convened a Working Group last year. Drawing on experiences of a dedicated group of Massachusetts district leaders, state education leaders, and charter management organization leaders, in addition to published research and publicly-available data on Massachusetts school leaders, Barr and Attuned Education Partners released &quot;Strengthening School Leadership in Massachusetts.&quot;</p>

<p class=""tyler"">Read Strengthening School Leadership report<a href=""https://barrfdn.issuelab.org/resource/strengthening-school-leadership-in-massachusetts.html%22%5D"">https://barrfdn.issuelab.org/resource/strengthening-school-leadership-in-massachusetts.html&quot;]</a></p>

<p>In response to the findings and set of solutions offered in the report, Barr invited public school systems (district or charter) or groups of public schools to apply for a grant to engage in a strategic planning process aimed at strengthening school leadership. There are many small school districts in Massachusetts. This RFP presented an opportunity for school system partnerships across geographic or governance boundaries to take on and champion this work together.</p>

628,Elevating the Arts in the South Coast of Massachusetts,"<p>As Creative Commonwealth Initiative enters new phase, Rayana Grace and John Vasconcellos of the SouthCoast Community Foundation reflect on the new artists, work, and partnerships that celebrate the rich cultural heritage of the South Coast.</p>","<p>Over the past two years, we have seen a major shift in the arts and culture landscape in Fall River and New Bedford, Massachusetts. The <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/arts-creativity/creative-commonwealth"">Creative Commonwealth Initiative</a> has offered our community and the SouthCoast Community Foundation (the Community Foundation), where we work, the opportunity to make that shift intentional, authentic, and – we believe - durable. As we enter the next phase of what we expect to be a decade-long partnership with the Barr Foundation and four other Massachusetts Community Foundations, we are happy to share a few reflections on our progress and lessons to date.</p>

<p>Located in the South Coast of the Commonwealth, the Community Foundation serves 41 cities and towns. The history of the area as a whaling hub turned manufacturing mecca and now fishing capital, has drawn immigrant groups from many nations. Those ethnic groups, including Portuguese, Cabo Verdean, Norwegian, French Canadian, Guatemalan, Salvadoran, Honduran, and many others have significantly influenced the richness of culture, food, language, and community we enjoy today.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--embarked""> <p>we</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>When we embarked upon the Creative Commonwealth Initiative, we started with outreach and conversations. Our goal was to better understand the creative assets, aspirations, and challenges in our communities. The major finding was that much of what these vibrant communities had to offer was not being elevated nor broadly celebrated.  This discovery led to four key questions that guided our pilot years:</p>

<ol>
<li>What role, as a community foundation, could we provide to elevate our immigrant communities - old and new - through the arts and cultural expression? </li>
<li>How could we elevate the artistic expression of culturally diverse populations to ensure that they are represented, and their voices amplified? </li>
<li>How could we catalyze local funding and investment from different sectors to support these stories that are integral to our communities? </li>
<li>How could we use our Creative Commonwealth Initiative as an avenue to have a deeper and more resonate impact in a meaningful and authentic way?</li>
</ol>

<p>As we tested new approaches to answering these questions, it has already generated tangible change in important ways.</p>
<h3>New work, new artists, and new places</h3>
<p>We witnessed the <a href=""https://www.bostonmagazine.com/arts-entertainment/2019/07/04/skynet-silver-current-new-bedford/"">Silver Current</a> installation transform the downtown New Bedford landscape and serve as a vibrant, enchanting community canopy with programming ranging from a New Bedford Ballet performance to weekly meditation gatherings. We have heard the voices of youth artists in Fall River, who were once unaware of their own city’s history, but who are now local experts telling stories through compelling art installations that suggest the future they are building. We have witnessed the creation of <a href=""https://www.southcoasttoday.com/news/20190704/new-mural-highlights-new-bedfords-cape-verdean-heritage"">a mural in New Bedford’s South end</a> – away from the City’s cultural core – featuring a young black girl boldly facing the highway that unsympathetically displaced and gutted communities of color in the 1970s.</p>

<p>Just two weeks ago in late September, we all witnessed a new wave of artistic vision flooding the streets of Fall River. The inaugural <a href=""https://www.fabricfallriver.com/About/about_fabric"">FABRIC Arts Festival</a> was the first of its kind for the city and the region. While Portuguese artistic expression generally takes a traditional approach, often with a warm and comforting look backwards at its heritage, this festival was imbued with the contemporary energy and excitement of new festivals in the Azores – with Azorean/Portuguese artists like Walk and Talk and Tremor. Not confined to a single dance hall, park, or museum, the Festival was spread throughout the city through robust collaboration. Concerts, movie screenings, presentations, and outdoor murals brought people together in every part of Fall River to celebrate the cultural richness of their city.</p>
<h3>New Creative Leaders and Philanthropic Partners</h3>
<p>Over a year ago, we had a conversation with FABRIC Festival lead organizer and local entrepreneur, Michael Benevides, about his vision of a contemporary Azorean arts festival. Michael is a successful businessman. Yet, since he had no experience in the arts performance world, he was reticent to apply to our Creative Commonwealth Initiative. With our encouragement, however, he submitted a proposal, and his project was awarded a $5,000 planning grant. This grew to $15,000, thanks to BayCoast Bank, a local funder and Community Foundation partner, who was equally excited about the vision for Fall River. In 2019, the festival was awarded a $20,000 Cultural Expression grant through our Creative Commonwealth Initiative. Additionally, the Bank Five Fund, which had no previous history of support for the arts, saw, through our efforts, the importance and relevance of the project and awarded a $25,000 grant. Our role as philanthropic matchmaker, by promoting opportunities and educating donors is critical to this work. When we can lay the groundwork for other donors to join in, the path to change is inevitable and, we hope, compelling.</p>
<h3>New Conversations</h3>
<p>As part of the FABRIC Festival, John had the opportunity to moderate a conversation with a local artist, international urban planner (and Fall River native), and a founder of a new arts organization. Together, we considered this moment for Fall River at this intersection of economic revitalization and creative place. The conversation drew a significant audience and provided an exciting and illuminating exchange of ideas, challenges, opportunities, and excitement for Fall River. The important question for us now is, how can we continue this conversation, and advance the work? There is so much more to come, and we – as community members - are the ones to drive it forward.</p>

<p>As a Community Foundation it is essential that we build trust and credibility that allows us to be recognized as a dependable partner, change agent, philanthropic matchmaker, and community leader. We look forward to building on this progress and continuing to develop new partners, new artists, and new local philanthropy to join us in this work.</p>"
627,Six Mobility Lessons from Europe’s Most Sustainable City,<p>From Boston to Oslo and back—here are transportation solutions we want to see implemented at home.</p>,"<p>Earlier this year, approximately 3,000 people from 400 cities around the world gathered in Oslo, Norway to share solutions for making cities more sustainable. The discussion took place at the <a href=""https://www.urban-future.org/"">URBAN FUTURE global conference</a> against the backdrop of a city leading by example. Oslo was named the 2019 European Green Capital for sustainable practices such as banning cars from the city center, incentivizing residents to buy electric cars, and electrifying fleets of ferries and buses in record time.</p>

<p>Barr’s Mobility team traveled to Oslo to join this conversation along with a small group of public officials, employers, and leaders of membership organizations from Massachusetts. The goal of the trip was for the group of Massachusetts delegates to learn together, explore opportunities for collaboration, and come back inspired to take risks in the region. We invited leaders who demonstrated interest in transportation, economic development, and sustainability, and who upon returning home, would have a platform to try something innovative and positively impact a large constituency.</p>

<p>Below, several of the delegates share one idea that inspired them from the trip. The ideas represent mobility solutions that are working in Oslo and that could help solve Massachusetts’ mobility challenges.</p>
<h3>Build up bus service.</h3>
<p>My experience in Oslo highlighted the importance of integrating bus and rail seamlessly into our existing public transit system. From the moment we left the airport, it was clear that Oslo offers several options for environmentally-friendly travel: trains, ferries, buses, and readily-available scooters. Buses were a key piece to the system - covering areas that were not reached by train. The two modes complemented each other well. It was impossible to tell where one began and the other ended. Both modes were equally well maintained, which means people from all socio-economic backgrounds use them, which eliminated the mode segregation we see in the U.S. </p>

<p>I would love to see a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system in Boston and its surrounding areas. We need to better leverage and expand our bus system, including dedicated lanes for buses. My hope is that a BRT system would reduce ride share services and therefore traffic congestion. Finally, BRT would help to close Greater Boston&#39;s transportation gaps, providing greater access to jobs in Boston.<br>
<strong>-Myechia Minter-Jordan MD, MBA, President and CEO, The Dimock Center</strong></p>
<h3>Position cars as the alternative form of transportation.</h3>
<p>The mobility solution that I loved in Oslo and that we should consider for Greater Boston is fewer cars and more alternative transportation. The wide open city streets with so many pedestrians, cyclists, scooters, riders, etc. and almost NO cars was so amazing! And, it made the city safer, with people were out and about at 1:00 in the morning. I would be so happy to see Greater Boston head down a similar path.<br>
<strong>-Jason Jacobs, Producer and host of My Climate Journey podcast; Founder of Runkeeper</strong></p>
<h3>Create a Climate Budget.</h3>
<p>I came away from the experience in awe of the politics, adoption, and impact of Oslo&#39;s Climate Budget. In 2017, the Mayor of Oslo—a working class guy turned politician—created the Climate Budget to provide transparency and accountability for efforts aiming to reduce carbon emissions. The Climate Budget is an innovative governance tool that clearly outlines the initiatives that the City of Oslo will implement to reduce carbon, who is responsible for them, the timeline for their implementation, and the expected emission reductions in relation to the city’s climate goals. The Oslo Climate Budget has institutionalized scalable changes, interagency change management, and data driven procurement metrics. Boston could look to Oslo’s model and create a similar tool to help move toward its climate goals.<br>
<strong>-Wilnelia Rivera, Founder and Principal, Rivera Consulting; Founder and Host of Deep Democracy podcast</strong></p>
<h3>Make it easy to pay and move across modes.</h3>
<p>As a visitor in Oslo, I appreciated how easy it was to use the public transit system. I have experienced many public transit systems across the world, but this was the first time I was able to purchase a ticket through an app, using ApplePay and my thumb print. Scandinavian cities are moving toward fully digital payment schemes for public transit services. In the U.S., we need to consider providing good transport access to the unbanked. Transit design in Oslo does point to a future with more payment options. Tickets could also be purchased at train stations, bus terminals, sidewalk kiosks, and selected shops such as 7-Elevens. And once the ticket was purchased, it could be used on metros, trams, buses, ferries, and trains with free transfers across modes. Cities in Massachusetts should incentivize residents – and visitors! – to take public transit by making it this easy and convenient to get on and go.<br>
<strong>-Michael Kodransky, U.S. Director, Institute for Transportation &amp; Development Policy (ITDP)</strong></p>
<h3>Prioritize climate when evaluating policies.</h3>
<p>My biggest takeaway from the URBAN FUTURE conference is that climate is too often at the tail end of policy discussions, and needs to be a top-of-the-line priority in decision making. The health of our planet is dire, and we can&#39;t think we&#39;re going to take little steps anymore and change its trajectory. We need more significant commitments and, more importantly, accelerated results. If we have any chance of reducing, eliminating and perhaps even taking carbon out of the air, policy leaders need to start all initiative discussions with the question &quot;how will this proposed policy effect emissions and the warming of the planet?&quot;<br>
<strong>-Jay Ash, CEO, Massachusetts Competitive Partnership</strong></p>
<h3>Design spaces for people, not cars.</h3>
<p>While parking and traffic are key issues in Salem and other Massachusetts cities, we tend to lose sight of the fact that people are coming to cities, not to park, but to spend time doing stuff–eating, walking, shopping, playing, people watching, etc. In Oslo, I was struck by how removing cars from downtown streets opened up space to allow more of the “stuff” that people enjoy to take place. Oslo has reclaimed its streets for its people. A presentation by Brent Toderian at URBAN FUTURE described how Vancouver is doing the same. This past summer, the City of Salem rose to the challenge and took steps to make more space for people on its streets with pop-up bike lanes and other people-centric experiments.<br>

<p>In Oslo, we saw firsthand how people can get where they want to go efficiently, comfortably, and sustainably. Not only has Oslo overcome many of the same mobility challenges we are facing in Massachusetts—such as car congestion and gaps in public transit service—but the city has also dramatically reduced its transportation-related carbon emissions. If they can do it in Oslo, we can do it in Massachusetts!</p>

<p>Perhaps the most convincing of all was the effect this trip had on my husband, Rogelio, who also came. While he is a big fan of Barr’s mobility work, he is often skeptical that we can accomplish the radical behavior change that is needed to break America’s love affair with the car. He started the journey as a naysayer, “it will be impossible to get people out of their cars,” he said. “People love to drive too much.” By the end of the trip, he was thrilled with how easily the bullet train got us into Oslo center, he loved walking to the local theatre, found taking the bus to the Viking Museum a breeze, and enjoyed several coffees along the promenade. His big takeaway: This is a much better way to live (or so much more enjoyable) than being stuck in traffic. With the right solutions in place, even naysayers can become champions.</p>

594,Change is Constant. How Can Leaders Support Their Organizations to Adapt? ,"<p>In the first year of a six-year initiative, arts organizations explore three steps to confronting and embracing change.</p>","<p>Last fall, Barr <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/announcing-barr-klarman-massachusetts-arts-initiative"">announced</a> the Barr-Klarman Massachusetts Arts Initiative. This six-year, $25 million investment by Barr and The Klarman Family Foundation aims to strengthen the financial health and adaptive capacity of 29 Massachusetts arts organizations, enabling them to create strong artistic programming and contribute to the vitality of their communities. In addition to funding, this initiative provides technical assistance, coaching, and a learning curriculum centered on three core concepts: capitalization, adaptive capacity, and cultural competency. Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to join the workshop on adaptive capacity, led by a Cambridge-based firm <a href=""https://mindsatwork.com/"">Minds at Work</a>.</p>

<p>Adaptive capacity is the ability for individuals and organizations to shift in the face of environmental changes. There is currently a great need for this in the arts and cultural sector. Many arts organizations are recognizing that their audiences do not reflect the changing demographics of their communities, and that their programs are not keeping pace with the new and creative ways in which individuals are consuming content. Furthermore, while the price tag of production has gone up with inflation, funding for the arts has not. Many donors do not increase their giving year over year to match increasing production costs. This affects the quality of life for artists and arts organization staff members, as well as the quality of art itself. Although arts organizations are trying to evolve with their audiences, they are often constrained by old models and traditional ways of carrying out their work.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--is""> <p>capacity</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>During the workshop, many of the Barr-Klarman participating organizations shared that they are grappling with similar challenges related to change, including: finding new ways to engage their communities and diversify audiences; moving in a new strategic direction; changing organizational culture; and building important new relationships both internally and externally. Adaptive capacity focuses on building a set of skills and competencies to embrace change and take bold steps in response to external conditions. Towards that goal, Minds at Work introduced their “Immunity to Change” approach to growing adaptive capacity, beginning at the individual level. Below are three steps to help individuals, teams, and organizations make personal and collective adaptive changes.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Create an environment for stretching, not stressing.</h3>
<p>Often, what people think is fear of change is actually fear of loss. People are afraid to change because it might force them to give up comfortable habits or confront difficult truths. Minds at Work Co-Directors Maria DeCarvalho and Deborah Helsing first identified three &quot;learning zones&quot; – the comfort zone, the stretch zone, and the stress zone. The comfort zone is exactly what the name suggests, and many people like to stay in this zone because it is the space where they know they can do their work well. However, if one stays in the comfort zone, she will never learn to change or adapt. The stress zone is where pressure to solve a problem or change a behavior becomes so overwhelming that it shuts down positive action and receptivity to learning. The stretch zone is where people are challenged to think and work in different, new ways. It is where learning happens most effectively, sparking positive change and growth. This is where participants were invited to engage during the workshop. Participants were also encouraged to create this stretch environment within their organizations on an ongoing basis by prioritizing goal setting and providing both challenge and support in meeting those goals.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Get the problem right.</h3>
<p><div class=""Media -aside -left""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img alt=""Coach from Minds at Work in front of a group of people in a classroom style. "" class=""Media-image"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/crop/3582/square_crop.jpg?1569592842"" /> </div> </div>
Maria and Deb then led workshop participants through a personal map-making exercise in which each person set a personal improvement goal that would require an adaptive shift, not just a technical improvement. People around the room chose goals like: <em>getting better at communicating directly;</em> <em>reaching out to new communities beyond our traditional audience</em>; and <em>setting boundaries and sticking with them.</em> Then, participants worked with partners to unearth the psychological “Immune System” that keeps negative behaviors in place. Even if people have the desire to change, there can be an unexamined “Big Assumption” or belief holding them back. This can feel like having one foot on the gas pedal while the other foot is on the break.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Challenge the underlying assumption.</h3>
<p>Adaptive change requires addressing Big Assumptions that work against one’s goals. For example, a person may want to get better at delivering work on time. Underlying the behavior may be her belief that making even one mistake will result in losing the trust of her supervisor, so she may procrastinate on work to avoid errors, or become such a perfectionist that she misses deadlines. The behavior will not change until she confronts her Big Assumption that mistakes are unacceptable and harm professional relationships. In order to change that assumption and truly grow, she will need to reflect on and challenge the underlying belief that is driving the behavior. A behavior can’t change unless the underlying belief changes.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--can""> <p>behavior</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Participants concluded the two-day session by designing an experiment that would produce an outcome to challenge the universal truth of her Big Assumption, making learning—not willpower or simply improving technical skills—central to the process of making adaptive change. An experiment to test the Big Assumption could involve thinking back to a time where she or even her boss made a mistake that did not have dire consequences, or that led to new wisdom. Another approach might include interviewing a colleague about how they have handled making mistakes and learning from them. An organization that is using an adaptive capacity framework will create a safe, supportive environment for employees to challenge their assumptions and to test new behaviors and ways of working. An organization in which all employees are comfortable existing in the stretch zone can move forward and meet challenges more effectively.</p>

<p>Adopting an adaptive capacity framework in your organization takes time and can be challenging. That is OK! Barr-Klarman’s cohort training with Minds at Work created a foundation for organizations to learn about meeting environmental changes with a learning stance and to start applying the Immunity to Change methodology to their work moving forward. We are excited to continue this learning journey with the Barr-Klarman cohort this fall as we work in the curriculum pillar of cultural competency. </p>

593,Announcing Extension of Partnership with Five Community Foundations Advancing Arts Across Massachusetts ,"<p>Next three years will focus on implementing ambitious plans and expanding successful early efforts, with $5 million in new support from Barr, and partners’ commitments to collectively raise more than $1 million in new local arts philanthropy.</p>","<p>Today, we are thrilled to announce the next stage of the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/arts-creativity/creative-commonwealth"">Creative Commonwealth Initiative</a> and our commitment to extending the initiative for a decade. Launched in 2017, this initiative began as a collaboration with five community foundations in Massachusetts: <a href=""https://www.berkshiretaconic.org/bLearnbAboutBTCF/StrategicPriorities/ArtsBuildCommunity.aspx"">Berkshire Taconic Community Foundation</a>, <a href=""https://www.cfsema.org/about-us/creative-commonwealth"">Community Foundation of Southeastern Massachusetts</a>, <a href=""http://communityfoundation.org/nonprofits/valleycreates/"">Community Foundation of Western Massachusetts</a>, <a href=""http://eccf.org/creative-county"">Essex County Community Foundation</a>, and <a href=""https://www.greaterworcester.org/Grants/Grant-Program-Deadlines/Creative-Commonwealth-Initiative"">Greater Worcester Community Foundation</a>. Based on progress to date, and in service of the thoughtful, inspiring local plans developed for the 2020 to 2022 timeframe, Barr is providing each community foundation with $1 million in new support. Each community foundation has also committed to raising at least $200,000 in new local arts philanthropy from and for their communities.  We expect the Creative Commonwealth Initiative to continue beyond 2022, with a final phase focused on sustaining progress.</p>

<p>When we began this work in 2017, our shared hypothesis was straightforward: We believe arts and creativity are essential for thriving communities, that community foundations are well-positioned to catalyze more vibrant and sustainable arts ecosystems in the regions they serve, and that community foundation impact can be enhanced through strategies they design and pursue in their respective contexts. Barr provided initial planning funds followed by a two-year investment featuring $500,000 in core support to each partner; each partner in turn raised at least $100,000 in new local support. Partners also gathered several times to share knowledge and participate in collective learning.</p>

<p>To date, each community foundation has taken stock of the assets unique to its regional arts and creativity landscape. Each has convened and connected parties in this landscape, helping chart opportunities to advance the constellation of artists, arts nonprofits, public officials, and businesses that link people to arts and creativity. Each is in dialogue with grantees and donors who hold interest in finding new approaches to deepen community engagement in arts and creativity.</p>

<p>These partners remain co-investors in continued growth and change for their organizations—and communities. Each will seek to extend its networks, services, and contributions to the already vivid arts and creativity ecosystem in its region. Collectively, these community foundations are setting out to raise more than $1 million in new philanthropy over the next three years to fuel arts and creativity in their communities.</p>

<p>Barr funds will help them enhance internal capabilities, expand the work of area arts nonprofits, and implement other local priorities. 
Highlights of individual plans are summarized below.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Berkshire Taconic Community Foundation</strong> will expand its Arts Build Community initiative, a broad-based partnership of arts and culture nonprofits, schools and students, donors, and residents of diverse incomes, ethnicities and ages. The initiative will deploy over $600,000 in flexible grant support, provide group trainings and leadership development, and build cross-sector coalitions to more actively involve year-round residents in making and experiencing art in their communities, in their schools, and through Berkshire County’s celebrated arts and culture institutions. <a href=""https://www.berkshiretaconic.org/bLearnbAboutBTCF/StrategicPriorities/ArtsBuildCommunity.aspx"">Learn more</a>. </li>
<li><strong>Community Foundation of Southeastern Massachusetts</strong> will fund workshops and individualized coaching to advance the capacity of small, culturally diverse/immigrant arts and culture organizations, and support trainings for nonprofits across the area’s arts and culture sector. Continued focus on youth engagement will feature extending the successful Get Out and Art! campaign and expanding partnerships, including the New Bedford Housing Authority collaboration offering onsite access to art making. <a href=""https://www.cfsema.org/about-us/creative-commonwealth"">Learn more</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Community Foundation of Western Massachusetts</strong>, via its ValleyCreates initiative, will continue to strengthen and connect arts organizations and artists through collaborative grantmaking, capacity building opportunities, and convenings, while using strategies that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). The community foundation is also planning for an online regional ArtsHub to strengthen, connect, and raise the visibility of the arts sector, as well as an online platform that will highlight grantees and encourages co-investment from donors. <a href=""http://communityfoundation.org/nonprofits/valleycreates/"">Learn more</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Essex County Community Foundation</strong> will equip the Essex County arts and culture community with knowledge, tools, and funding that strengthens the arts ecosystem. The community foundation will invest in collaborative creative placemaking grants, advance cultural planning in the region, convene the arts community via Arts &amp; Culture Summits and Arts Funders’ gatherings, and build capacity within artists and nonprofits through workshops and “Think Labs” on topics relevant to the arts and culture sector. <a href=""http://eccf.org/creative-county"">Learn more</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Greater Worcester Community Foundation</strong> will support implementation of Worcester’s Cultural Plan, including serving as lead convener, hosting, and coordinating the annual public Community Plan Review; taking a leadership role in advancing specific strategic activities from the plan; and making Creative Spark grants to advance new projects and partnerships aligned with the goals of the plan. <a href=""https://www.greaterworcester.org/Grants/Grant-Program-Deadlines/Creative-Commonwealth-Initiative"">Learn more</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>As our Arts &amp; Creativity program <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/new-directions-for-barr-arts-creativity-program"">took shape in 2016</a>, we had the opportunity to expand statewide. We realized that this aim would require capable partners with trusted relationships, credibility, and first-hand knowledge of the varied needs and opportunities in communities across Massachusetts. We viewed community foundations as ideal partners in this effort, and our experience, including evaluation findings in the initial years of Creative Commonwealth, reinforce this view.</p>

<p>We are privileged to be in partnership with a set of local philanthropies who share our conviction that arts and creativity are essential to how people live, learn, and thrive together, who seek to benefit local artists and arts nonprofits, and who are willing to take the risks and welcome the learning that are inherent to growth and change.</p>

<p>We look forward to the next steps in this collective journey, and to providing periodic updates on progress as well as lessons gained through our partnership.</p>"
591,"Reliable Energy for a Changing Climate: Safe, Secure, and Clean",<p>The climate has changed and our energy grid must change with it.</p>,"<p>We all need safe, reliable power, but every day, we learn more about the dangerous vulnerabilities and disastrous climate impacts of our current power grid. Our energy grid was designed over a century ago. It may have been considered a marvel at the time, but now we know it’s already putting our communities at risk. It’s time to rethink conventional wisdom about how we can build a truly modern grid that can provide power reliably.</p>
<h3>Natural Gas is a fossil fuel that contributes to climate change, and is not safe.</h3>
<p>As aging coal and oil power plants (some over 50 and 60 years old - decades beyond what is considered their safe, useful lifespans), <a href=""http://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/2019/05/20/the-unsung-reliability-hero-of-new-england-energy-efficiency/"">are finally being retired</a>, along with the remaining, antiquated nuclear plants in the New England fleet, natural gas has become the primary fuel for generating electricity, and a growing portion of the fuel for heating.
What’s wrong with more gas? We’ve been piping and trucking gas to homes and businesses for so long that sometimes people forget just how dangerous it is. That all changed when <a href=""https://www.wbur.org/news/2018/09/13/multiple-explosions-fires-lawrence-andover-north-andover"">75 gas explosions rocked Lawrence, Andover, and North Andover</a>, killing one young man and devastating those communities. The effects of the disaster lasted into winter, leaving people without heating and unable to use gas stoves. And gas infrastructure poses longer-term threats to public health, too, largely in communities of color and low-income communities. Compressor stations emit hazardous air pollutants like <a href=""https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2019/05/23/weymouth-echoes-flint/1ksKThEGt03z7haMV7jTgJ/story.html"">formaldehyde and benzene</a>, power plants put out nitrogen oxides, and gas appliances have been found to create pollution <a href=""https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.122-A27"">indoors</a> and <a href=""https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/07/major-us-cities-are-leaking-methane-twice-rate-previously-believed"">out</a>. All of these threats are compounded by the fact that the profusion of gas infrastructure is <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/09/09/climate-change-threatens-earth-us-open-nearly-200-power-plants/2155631001/"">accelerating the pace of climate change</a>, which poses an existential threat to all of our communities.</p>
<h3>We have all the technologies we need to build a better grid.</h3>
<p>The alternative to this dangerous, dirty system isn’t theoretical. Imagine if the next time a storm knocked out a transmission line, the <a href=""https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/sonnen-delivers-long-promised-goal#gs.0m7tgn"">batteries in your building</a> went to work to keep the lights on? What if, in the midst of a heat wave, when a power plant tripped offline, <a href=""https://www.masscec.com/technology-programs/community-microgrids-program"">the microgrid in your neighborhood</a> kept people cool and safe by powering heat pumps that provided air conditioning. We have the technologies to make that a reality now. In Chelsea, for example, grassroots activists and innovative energy companies are already working together to create solar and battery-powered microgrids that could power entire neighborhoods in the event of inevitable interruptions to our current infrastructure.  Today, the costs of solar and wind are already competitive, <a href=""https://rmi.org/insight/clean-energy-portfolios-pipelines-and-plants"">if not lower</a> than building new natural gas plants. These economics will only get more favorable for clean energy as innovation and experience continues to drive down costs. Building new wind and solar projects that are supported by energy storage also creates the fuel diversity that New England needs.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.timesunion.com/business/article/New-CEO-at-grid-operator-excited-about-challenge-13987301.php"">next leader of New York’s system operator</a> put it well: “We’re really on the cusp of the most radical and exciting set of changes in this industry in the 100 years that we&#39;ve had a power grid.&quot; That change will only be ushered in if the region follows through on creating new markets and embracing a new design for reliability. Instead, ISO-NE and utilities have <a href=""https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/massachusetts-grid-study-disrupts-1gw-distributed-solar-pipeline#gs.2o2rvt"">worked against new renewable generation</a> while resisting the long-overdue <a href=""https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/trending/fffGmdU96-aDfK35Yxnmxw2"">retirement of old fossil fuel plants</a>. This not only inflates energy costs for customers, it continues to threaten health and safety of communities impacted by both the danger of aging infrastructure and the increasing impacts of climate change. What we need in the Northeast is to seize the opportunity to use new technologies and systems to build a safer, more secure, and cleaner grid.</p>

590,Expanding Access to a Winning Climate Strategy,<p>New report features myriad ways states and cities are putting equity in the center of their climate and energy policies.</p>,"<p>The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) is an impressive climate success story. Since 2009, it has been reducing pollution, creating jobs, and boosting economies for all participating states – generating <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/northeast-carbon-markets-delivers-benefits-for-all"">$1.4 billion in net economic value between 2015 through 2017 alone</a>. However, this market-based solution has not yet reached all communities. Some have found it easy to participate and access the opportunities and benefits – like clean energy jobs, incentives, rebates, and savings from lower energy bills. Others face barriers. This is not only unfair, there is no way states can do their part to address our climate emergency if only some communities participate. It can also worsen inequality.</p>

<p>One of the most exciting trends is how states have been responding to this challenge. In recent years, we have seen a wide range of new approaches for expanding access, reducing barriers, and boosting participation. To build understanding of what states are doing and foster shared learning, <a href=""https://www.rggiprojectseries.org/"">The RGGI Project Series</a> (an independent research and analysis effort supported by several climate funders including Barr) commissioned an independent study by Jeanne Herb and Marjorie Kaplan of the Rutgers Bloustein School. Their analysis, <a href=""https://barrfdn.issuelab.org/resource/field-notes-equity-state-climate-policy.html"">“Field Notes: Centering Equity Goals in State Climate Policy,”</a> was released last week. Based on more than 70 interviews with state officials and nonprofit leaders, it takes an in-depth look at the many new and creative ways the RGGI states, plus NJ and VA, are integrating equity goals in their climate policy.</p>

<p>The researchers found approaches ranging from including equity commitments in new laws, executive orders, or statewide plans, cross-agency partnerships, financing initiatives geared towards overcoming market barriers and other measures. Recognizing that this work is still in its early days, the researchers also highlight important factors that would allow states to go even further to accelerate our transition to more clean, efficient, and sustainable energy, while also generating more equitable outcomes. These key factors fall into three broad themes:</p>

<p><strong>Make policy-making a participatory process.</strong>  Very often, public input in policy making is limited. It’s a 2:00 PM meeting on a Thursday in a hearing room, where everyone gets their two minutes at the microphone. It doesn’t have to be this way. In fact, many local, state, and regional climate efforts are being informed by much more meaningful community engagement and participatory processes. They can continue to build on this progress by employing approaches that engender trust between decision-makers and community leaders and residents, and that generate smarter policies. Governments could also partner with and provide resource to community organizations with skill and capacity to foster this kind of authentic engagement in planning and decision making.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t rely on markets alone. Government plays a vital role ensuring investments achieve equitable outcomes.</strong> The public sector plays an important role in ensuring that communities facing the greatest hurdles to participation in the clean energy economy are not left out. On their own, private markets rarely achieve significant penetration of clean and efficient energy in such communities. Directives from governors and legislatures greatly influence how state agencies design and implement programs and policies.</p>

<p><strong>Recognize that RGGI – and energy – are only one part of the solution.</strong> RGGI is undoubtedly having a positive impact. And, it is getting better all the time – including in the many new ways states are targeting benefits to communities that have faced barriers to participation. Yet, leading states also recognize RGGI is not a silver bullet for climate or equity goals. The challenges and opportunities we see in energy and climate are closely intertwined with public health, housing, and economic development, among other areas. So, states are forging new collaborations and creating new policies, regulations, and programs that cross agency and issue silos. They are also integrating climate preparedness and mitigation efforts.</p>

<p>With so much activity and potential to build on, a critical next step for RGGI states will be to learn what’s working and what isn’t, and to develop analytical tools to forecast benefits and impacts of different approaches. This will allow states to prioritize solutions that are most worthwhile to scale. Investing in deepening that knowledge base and facilitating shared learning may be one of the most constructive roles for philanthropy in the years ahead.</p>

<p>While there is much more to do to meet ambitious equity and climate goals, it is encouraging to see so much progress, so much willingness to experiment and learn, and – above all – such commitment to advancing the transformation of our energy system to be clean, sustainable, and just.</p>

589,Eight Questions with Barr's New Education Program Officer,<p>A conversation with Ali Gross about her journey in education and the work underway to support communities in reimagining the high school experience.</p>,"<h3>Tell us how you got started in education. What was your journey like before Barr?</h3>
<p>I come from a family of educators. In college, I started to put names and concepts to the different experiences I’d had across my own schools and what I’d seen in the schools where my family members worked. Studying sociology, education, and the structural inequities across our school system really lit a fire in me. While I was in college, I was a writing tutor for high school students in Boston. After I graduated, I taught sixth grade through the organization Citizen Schools at the Edwards Middle School and then worked at Boston Arts Academy, both Boston public schools. I loved being around the energy of young artists in Boston. I went to graduate school to learn more about school and system design, and then started in a newly created role in the Boston Public Schools central office when I graduated. I was interested in supporting teachers and principals to create the kinds of classrooms where students would be excited to learn.</p>
<h3>Who was your favorite teacher and why?</h3>
<p>I’ve had a few teachers, including my parents and a number of colleagues, that have really encouraged and pushed me. I think the teacher who’s had the biggest impact on my career path was my professor at Tufts University, Steve Cohen. He is a skilled question-asker and thought-provoker. He made me think about things differently. He gave us an assignment to design our ideal high school. He pushed us to think deeply about equity. He created a course for us to visit and learn about different schools. He taught me how to go into a school and try to really understand what might be happening. He made me excited about what’s possible in education. On top of all that, he also taught me where to find good bagels in Boston.</p>
<h3>In your most recent role, you worked with school leaders in Boston Public Schools to support teachers. Could you tell us a bit more about that? What did you learn?</h3>
<p>I learned a lot about how a district can support schools and how I could serve as a bridge between schools and central office. I loved my job because I got to go into many different classrooms across the city and see the incredible work teachers and principals were doing from early childhood all the way through high school. I learned a lot about the challenges schools can face and the kind of conditions that produce excellent teaching and learning. This role taught me about what it means to be a supportive partner by giving and receiving feedback, asking good questions, and listening well.</p>
<h3>What&#39;s one particularly inspiring project or school that you&#39;ve worked with? What was so inspiring about that experience?</h3>
<p>Senior Grant Night at the Boston Arts Academy is one of my favorite examples of the amazing work students and schools can do. Every senior identifies an issue in their community that they are passionate about, and then comes up with a way to use their art form to address that issue. They write a grant proposal and present it to community members for feedback. The issues that students identify and the solutions they come up with are really incredible, and so is the event itself. It brings together so many community members to support students’ learning in a real way. It gives me a lot of hope for our future to see this kind of learning and work—I’ve been so inspired every year I participated. Through my role at Barr I am excited to support high schools to create meaningful, deep learning experiences that all students consistently engage in as a core part of school.</p>
<h3>What are two lessons that you bring with you from working inside a large public school district to Barr?</h3>
<p>The first lesson is the importance of trusting relationships. I hope to be someone who inspires trust and openness, and who earns it by being a thoughtful partner and listener. The second lesson is about the complexity of schools and of change. Every school and every community is different, and even though they might share similar strengths or challenges, it’s important to learn as much as possible about their specific context in order to actually be a helpful partner and advocate.</p>
<h3>You’ve been at Barr for four months now. What have you been up to?</h3>
<p>My first big project at Barr was launching a request for proposals from communities who want to build a portrait of a high school graduate. The RFP was an opportunity for communities to deeply plan what they want their high school students to know and be able to do when they graduate. Schools can use this as a tool for aligning and clarifying priorities. We’re excited to partner with some new communities across New England! I’ve also been working on concepts for three learning communities—one to support Portrait of a Graduate grantees, and the others to support high school grantees across the Catalyze New Models portfolio.</p>
<h3>Has anything surprised you in your first few months?</h3>
<p>One pleasant surprise has been the smaller office community. I’ve felt really welcomed here, like I’ve joined a family. People ask me how I’m doing and they really care.</p>
<h3>What&#39;s one fun fact we should know about you?</h3>
<p>I love food! I actually have a spreadsheet of my favorite restaurants organized by meal and neighborhood. I’m always open to trying to new places, so please make recommendations. And I am happy to share my spreadsheet with anyone who isn’t sure where to eat when they’re in Boston.</p>"
588,No Time for Complacency,"<p>New scorecard celebrates U.S. cities leading on clean energy. Yet, even leaders must do more to access the full economic opportunities and to address our climate emergency.</p>","<p>The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) recently released its newest ranking of 75 large US cities for their work on energy efficiency, clean energy, and reducing emissions. In this fourth edition of the <a href=""https://aceee.org/local-policy/city-scorecard"">City Clean Energy Scorecard</a>, Boston retained its #1 ranking, followed closely by San Francisco, Seattle, Minneapolis, and Washington. Given impressive strides and strong momentum, Cincinnati, Hartford, and Providence gained special notice as “cities to watch.&quot;</p>

<p>It is encouraging to see so many cities engaged in this critical work, and even competing to outdo one another. As ACEEE stressed, however, all cities “have considerable room for improvement, even those ranked in the top tier.” This is no time to be complacent. The harmful effects of climate change are accelerating and growing more severe every year. As United Nations secretary general António Guterres pointed out in his March 2019 Op-Ed in the Guardian, “<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/15/climate-strikers-urgency-un-summit-world-leaders"">climate delay is almost as dangerous as climate denial</a>.” If we fail to move quickly and boldly enough, we will be too late to make a difference. We also risk missing out on a massive opportunity to create good-paying jobs and spur just and inclusive economic development. Although the United States is among leading nations in renewable energy growth, other countries started sooner, are investing more, and are moving faster than we are. We can still catch up, compete, and even lead. Yet, without greater ambition and more visionary policies, we risk being merely bit players in the world’s next major energy economy.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--fail""> <p>we</p> </blockquote></p>

<p><strong>We are in a climate emergency.</strong> This latest ACEEE scorecard was released against the backdrop of dire news on climate change. Scientists have confirmed July 2019 as the warmest month the world has experienced since record-keeping began more than a century ago. According to the UN, climate disasters capable of causing death, displacement, and suffering now occur at the rate of one a week globally. Some make the headlines such as the record smashing heat waves in Europe. Many don’t. Early in August, Greenland experienced melting of its ice sheets at <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2019/07/31/greenland-ice-sheet-is-throes-one-its-greatest-melting-events-ever-recorded/"">a rate unseen in over four hundred years</a>, increasing risks to coastal communities from sea level rise.</p>

<p><strong>The benefits of a clean energy transition are massive.</strong> But competition is fierce, fast, and ahead of us. The U.S. clean energy economy is growing fast. The <a href=""https://www.e2.org/reports/clean-jobs-america-2019/"">2019 Clean Jobs America analysis</a> by the national business group E2 found that clean energy jobs totaled more than 3.26 million at the end of 2018. Already outnumbering fossil fuels jobs by nearly three to one, clean energy jobs are projected to keep growing this year and into the future. With bold leadership and visionary policies, we can accelerate this growth path, create even more jobs, and spur economic growth. We also avoid the ballooning costs of negative health impacts and climate risks caused by fossil fuel emissions. If we don’t take advantage of this opportunity, there is a huge threat that the US will slip further behind other countries – Germany, China, India, Brazil, among many others who are racing to secure their place in this rapidly-changing market, and using all the policy levers at their disposal to accelerate growth.</p>

<p>I also want to call attention to two new metrics on the ACEE scorecard: 1) how well cities are promoting renewable energy, and 2) their investment in and engagement with low-income communities and communities of color. These two domains are critically important to achieving progress on climate action in cities. Greater efficiency in energy and transportation is essential but insufficient. Cities also need to boost clean energy to replace fossil fuels. Furthermore, they must do so in ways that are inclusive, ensuring all communities have a part in planning and decision making, and can access the opportunities and benefits. Otherwise, they will add to deeper economic inequality.  Providence, Rhode Island has been exemplary in this respect – forming a “Racial and Environmental Justice Committee” of leaders from communities that have suffered the most harm from fossil fuel pollution and climate impacts, and that face the greatest hurdles to participation in the clean energy economy. This committee is partnering with city leaders in shaping their climate and energy plan. It has been our privilege at Barr to support Providence in this work.</p>

<p>We are in a climate emergency. An essential part of the remedy is rapid and complete transformation of our energy economy. This transformation also holds the potential for creating a more just, prosperous, and healthy nation and world. To avert climate catastrophe and seize this opportunity we must raise our ambitions, and fortify our resolve. Above all, we must hold our elected leaders accountable for leadership – for eradicating policies and practices that serve and sustain fossil fuel interests, and working instead to foster innovation, speed, and growth in the clean energy economy.</p>"
587,Race to Lead 2019,<p>Building Movement Project seeks input for a new survey on leadership and race in the nonprofit sector.</p>,"<p>In 2016, the <a href=""https://www.buildingmovement.org/"">Building Movement Project</a> conducted its first national survey on race and leadership in nonprofits. The data from that survey led to the development of the influential <a href=""http://racetolead.org/"">Race to Lead</a> report series. The series has since become the largest national data set on race and leadership in the sector. And the report findings have challenged the way the nonprofit sector has been approaching the racial leadership gap.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce an opportunity to contribute to research for Race to Lead 2019 through a confidential survey. Responses are welcome from anyone working for pay in the U.S. nonprofit sector.</p>
<h4>Please Take the Race to Lead Survey:</h4>

<p>To help Building Movement Project reach as many nonprofit staff as possible, please also share the link with your colleagues and networks.</p>

<p>One of the Barr Foundation’s core values is to invest in leadership, which we see as one of the essential capacities needed for a healthy, effective social sector. Through Barr’s <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/sector-effectiveness"">Sector Effectiveness</a> portfolio, we support efforts to cultivate leadership in the region that is representative of the diversity in our communities, highly skilled, and well prepared. We are particularly interested in work to build a pipeline of diverse, well-prepared leaders who can motivate others, drive change, and produce results. Since 2017, Barr has been proud to support Building Movement Project and its contributions toward this goal.</p>

586,"In the Midst of a Transportation Crisis, Let’s Have Some Hope",<p>Results of three bus pilot projects prove that change is possible.</p>,"<p>I work every day to help improve how transportation gets people where they need to go, and I’m an optimist. Wait a minute – optimist? And transportation? In the same sentence? Did you just read that right?</p>

<p>Lately, it has been bad-news-day after bad-news-day for transportation in Massachusetts. Ongoing Red Line delays. Record-keeping nightmare at the RMV. Boston being ranked <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimgorzelany/2019/02/11/here-are-the-u-s-cities-suffering-the-worst-traffic-congestion/#3cede6516e36"">#1 for worst traffic in the country</a>. The <a href=""https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2019/06/Inequitable-Exposure-to-Vehicle-Pollution-MA.pdf"">Union of Concerned Scientists’ report</a> that quantifies the inequitable air pollution exposure from cars, trucks, and buses in communities of color in Massachusetts. How can one possibly be hopeful?</p>

<p>Despite these challenges and more, change is possible. We’ve seen it, recently, right here in Greater Boston. And it didn’t take decades and billions of dollars.</p>

<p>It took a small group of people getting creative with some paint and cones. And it made a difference for thousands of people. Three pilots tested these Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) elements along Massachusetts Ave in Arlington, Mt. Auburn Street in Cambridge and Watertown, and Broadway in Everett. Through experiments in 2018 and 2019, these cities and towns made buses faster and more reliable for over 30,000 people each day. Red paint and cones clearly identified designated lanes for buses. Some rubber IKEA-like pieces stacked on top of a sidewalk made stepping onto a bus much easier. Some traffic signals reprogrammed to optimize the number of people moving through some sticky intersections.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--in""> <p>experiments</p> </blockquote></p>
<h4>Based on MBTA data and other surveys, we found that the pilots improved peoples’ experience in a variety of ways:</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Bus riders saved 5-10 minutes per trip.</strong> On Mass Ave in Arlington, people on morning buses bound for Alewife and Harvard Square saved up to 10 minutes each morning; riders on buses on Mt. Auburn Street saved five minutes, on average.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Buses were more reliable.</strong> Buses’ arrival times were closer to schedule. This meant bus riders had more predictable commutes and could plan for their day. Buses impacted by the pilot were 64% more reliable in Arlington (instead of 7 minutes, it was 2.5) and nearly 60% more reliable in Cambridge.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Waiting for the bus was a pleasant experience.</strong> Not only was the wait shorter and more predictable, it was also infused with beauty. A bus shelter in Everett came alive with thousands of flowers. A half-dozen shelters in Arlington were painted by local artists. Shelters in Cambridge were dressed with panels reminding riders that the lane was &quot;dedicated to you.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>People on bikes and in cars liked the pilots too.</strong> Non-bus riders were surveyed to understand what they liked and didn’t like about the pilots. In Cambridge, 80% of survey respondents who biked felt that the street functioned better, and 94% of cyclists surveyed wanted the pilot changes to remain. The number of drivers reporting that they were satisfied or very satisfied with the way the street functioned increased by nearly 10 percentage points. In Arlington, 94% of surveyed bicyclists were very satisfied or satisfied with the pilot, and more than half of surveyed drivers said the bus lane should be made permanent.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a data-flickr-embed=""true"" data-header=""true""  href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/131019823@N06/albums/72157709857185331"" title=""BostonBRT Pilot Projects""><img src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48365257706_0076249fbf_h.jpg"" width=""1600"" height=""1067"" alt=""BostonBRT Pilot Projects""></a><script async src=""//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script></p>

<p>So, are these types of projects more of what Massachusetts needs? Yes! These projects started as pilots. Yet nearly all of them have been made permanent already or will be later this year. Kudos to the municipalities that stepped up to the challenge, as well as Boston and Somerville (who are also investing in bus priority). And, to the MBTA and BostonBRT partners* for their essential roles in realizing these experiments.</p>

<p>Bus priority – and someday, <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/buses-next-in-transportation"">Bus Rapid Transit</a>, aren’t the only answers. We need other transportation projects too that move high volumes of people, safely, reliably, and that reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. These bus priority projects, quick to implement, also closely align with the first two recommendations from the 2018 Governor’s <a href=""https://www.mass.gov/news/commission-on-the-future-of-transportation-releases-recommendations-aimed-to-move-more-people"">Future of Transportation Commission report</a>: 1) prioritize public transit and 2) design roads to prioritize people-throughput, not vehicles. The report states that going forward, roadway owners must prioritize the movement of as many people as possible, regardless of modes. These projects are emblematic of these two recommendations, so much so that Governor Baker now calls himself “a big bus-lane guy.&quot;</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--priority""> <p>bus</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>While these projects lessened the frustration of 30,000 people each day, they impacted fewer than 5% of all people that ride the MBTA. We’ve got a ways to go. But, we can do it. We have seen that change is possible. I’m optimistic that bus priority projects are going to continue to multiply, and that municipalities and other partners will continue to step up to support our public transit system in Greater Boston.</p>

585,Words of Advice from Seven Schools Reimagining Where Learning Happens,"<p>After two years of planning work, school teams share what they have learned about redesigning high schools to better leverage community assets.</p>","<p>Barr recently awarded implementation grants to <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/barr-awards-17-million-in-second-quarter-of-2019"">seven high schools</a> with plans to redesign their schools to provide diverse, authentic learning experiences outside of traditional classroom settings. Known as the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/new-grants-support-11-schools-redesign-where-learning-happens"">Wider Learning Ecosystem cohort</a>, these schools from across New England engaged in two years of planning, which included deeply engaging students, community members, and other stakeholders in thinking through how to leverage their community assets to address college and career readiness gaps and promote successful postsecondary transitions. We are excited to continue to partner with these schools to offer all of their students opportunities to gain knowledge, skills, and progress toward high school graduation through a combination of learning experiences in their communities, including: <div class=""Media -small -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img alt=""Three icons representing a wider learning ecosystem"" class=""Media-image"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3053/crop_preview.jpg?1642125299"" /> </div> </div></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Anytime-anywhere learning opportunities</strong> that enable students to participate in experiential learning and build social capital in the community and augment the school’s capacity to provide comprehensive programs of study.</li>
<li><strong>Career development experiences</strong> that promote students’ awareness of their interests and options and deepen student engagement in school through connecting the relevance of their coursework to their future plans.<br></li>
<li><strong>Early college experiences</strong> that expose students to the environment of post-secondary education and enable students to earn college credits while completing the requirements for their high school diploma. </li>
</ul>

<p>Before these partners shift focus to implementation, we wanted to make sure we took the opportunity to learn from their experience over the past two years. Barr&#39;s Education Team and The Learning Agenda (who facilitated the Wider Learning Ecosystem learning community), recently asked our partners to reflect on the question: <em>What advice would you give to educators interested in taking steps toward a high school redesign to create more authentic and equitable learning opportunities for their students?</em> Responses from the planning teams are featured below, organized under five common themes.</p>
<h3>1. Start with a clear vision and focus on student needs.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Be clear about your vision up front to help build consensus. More importantly, continuously anchor planning conversations to your goals by revisiting: “Why are we doing this? What do we hope to accomplish? What do we want students to know and be able to do?” —<strong>Winooski Middle High School, Winooski, VT</strong></p>

<p>Starting with our vision (or portrait) of a graduate helped us direct our work. We spent time assessing what things we were already doing that supported students&#39; progress toward specific aspects of the vision of a graduate. In the areas where we knew we needed to do better, we focused on the what before attempting the how. What did we actually want when all was said and done? Then, we worked backward. —<strong>Manchester High School, Manchester, CT</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>2. Engage and empower stakeholders throughout the process.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Redesign needs to happen from the bottom up, not the top down. Intellectually we know this, but we often resort back to who we can get at the table the easiest. One quote from the equitable redesign work group that stuck with us was, “if you’re not at the table, you’re on the menu.”  —<strong>Manchester West High School, Manchester, NH</strong></p>

<p>Identify a small number of committed and influential stakeholders in your community early on to engage in the planning process. Our key champions included parents, businesses that offered internships, and community organizations that served as connectors to new potential partners. We found that dividing the redesign team into smaller work groups helped increase the opportunity for meaningful involvement of a wider range of stakeholders. —<strong>Nokomis Regional High School, Newport, ME</strong></p>

<p>Plan for widespread engagement of teachers, students, family, and the community throughout the process. We took a ‘broad brushstroke’ approach that included hosting community forums, conducting surveys, hosting focus groups, engaging non-school stakeholders on our planning team and on subcommittees, leveraging existing school and district initiatives, creating a website, and gathering consistent student feedback through mini-surveys administered during class. —<strong>Somerville High School, Somerville, MA</strong></p>

<p>Develop clear messages and visuals so that everyone, particularly historically marginalized groups, is empowered in the process. Find ways to grow and support leaders and champions from each stakeholder group. —<strong>Manchester High School, Manchester, CT</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>3. Build a network of support and seek advice from others.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Talking to teachers and leaders at other schools through school visits has been immeasurably helpful in demonstrating the importance of taking our time and carefully figuring out what is important to our students, families, community members, and staff. —<strong>Blackstone Academy, Pawtuket, RI</strong></p>

<p>Seek out strong allies and critical friends, especially other schools engaged in redesign work. —<strong>Common Ground High School, New Haven, CT</strong></p>

<p>Learn from other schools that have engaged in this work. We found it beneficial to have an outside partner with knowledge and expertise in school redesign to support the management of this large-scale project and process. —<strong>Somerville High School, Somerville, MA</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>4. Invest time in developing a realistic plan and implementation strategy.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Be careful and intentional about how you roll this out. We found that too much information can overwhelm or create skepticism, while too little information results in feelings of disconnect, powerlessness, and frustration.  —<strong>Manchester High School, Manchester, CT</strong> </p>

<p>Staged implementation has worked well for us. In particular, choosing to re-build students’ experiences starting with a new incoming class, followed by each grade level, helped make the design work more manageable and keeps the focus on creating strong pathways. —<strong>Common Ground High School, New Haven, CT</strong></p>

<p>Prioritize the long-term sustainability and feasibility of your plan. Invest in the strategies that offer the greatest promise for enhancing students’ learning experiences. Determine how you’ll measure success. Reflect and adjust plans as needed. —<strong>Nokomis Regional High School, Newport, ME</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>5. Engage in reflective practice and continuous learning.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Build in testing, learning, and reflecting cycles in tandem with capacity building efforts. It is through prototyping circles that we understand what works and achieve greater clarity on the why and the how.  —<strong>Winooski Middle High School, Winooski VT</strong></p>

<p>Spend time up front creating systems of accountability that hold you to design principles and create feedback loops with all key constituents —<strong>Common Ground High School, New Haven, CT</strong></p>

<p>Pause and reflect frequently. It’s better to do one thing at a time and do it well than to do many things with little follow through. —<strong>Manchester High School, Manchester, CT</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Members of this Wider Learning Ecosystem cohort and redesign experts recently shared their stories of struggle and success on a topic that emerged as an important theme across the cohort: sustainable school change. We are excited to share the resulting new guide, developed by The Learning Agenda, with all schools interested in meaningful change:</p>

<p>It is a privilege for us to celebrate and recognize this extraordinary group of leaders through the Barr Fellowship. Recognizing that the challenges we’re facing in our region require the engagement and collaboration of all sectors, this class includes nonprofit, faith-based, and school leaders and—for the first time—a leader from a public agency, the Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics, and a leader from a for-profit social enterprise, Greentown Labs. Combined, these 12 leaders focus on a diverse set of social issues, and we hope that the shared learning they experience and the relationships they develop will positively benefit their organizations and the communities in which we all live and work.</p>

<p>Members of this class will participate in a <strong>two-year program</strong> that aims to provide personal and professional rejuvenation; to strengthen leadership teams in their organizations; and to build a stronger network of civic leaders in Greater Boston. </p>

<p>The Barr Fellowship experience begins with a <strong>ten-day group learning journey</strong> outside the United States. Each journey is carefully designed to immerse Fellows in a collective growth experience; build deep relationships among Fellows; and offer a disruption from their day-to-day work.</p>

<p>Fellows then embark on a <strong>three-month personal sabbatical</strong> during which they are asked to disengage completely from their organizations. At the same time, organizations name an interim leader (or leadership team) who takes on increased responsibility during the Fellow’s absence. The Fellowship offers coaching and collaborative learning retreats for these interim leaders in order to strengthen the overall leadership within the organization.</p>

<p>In addition, each organization receives an <strong>award of up to $125,000</strong> to invest in leadership, organizational development, and in exploratory projects. (Program and funding exceptions will be made as legally required regarding the participation of Fellows from for-profit entities and public agencies).</p>

<p>Fellows receive access to executive coaches who serve as collaborators on a journey of growth, helping to support personal and professional development. But perhaps most important, the Fellows learn from one another, <strong>benefiting from the cohort’s diversity</strong> in experiences, viewpoints, and approaches to problem-solving. We believe that cohort-based and <strong>peer-to-peer learning</strong> opportunities are among the most effective in helping leaders to develop new skills and perspectives as well as a supportive network that can promote sustained engagement and creative partnership.</p>

<p>At the end of the two-year Fellowship period, each class is integrated into the Barr Fellowship Network, a forum through which participating leaders continue to learn from each other, deepen relationships, and potentially create collaborations that benefit the city as well as their organizations. There are <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/barr-fellowship/alumni"">68 alumni of the Barr Fellowship program</a> since its inception in 2005.</p>

<p>Investing in leadership is a core value of the Foundation that permeates all of our activities. We are thrilled to bring this value to life through the Barr Fellowship program. Please join us in congratulating and celebrating this group of 12 leaders for their significant contributions to the Greater Boston community.</p>

549,What Do We Want All of Our High School Graduates to Know and Be Able to Do?,<p>Barr announces RFP for New England communities to build a “portrait of a graduate” – a collective vision of high school graduates who are prepared for post-secondary success.</p>,"<p>The Barr Foundation’s <a href=""http://www.barrfoundation.org/education"">Education Program</a> believes in the potential of all students. When they graduate high school, all students should be equipped to succeed in college, career, and community. Making this a reality for all students takes robust community engagement and intentional planning. That’s where a “portrait of a graduate” can help.</p>

<p>A portrait of a graduate articulates a community’s collective vision of what its high school students will know and be able to do upon graduation. It embraces a comprehensive view that combines content knowledge, critical thinking skills, and habits that set students up for success.</p>

<p>We are excited to announce a request for proposals to support up to 20 communities across New England to build community-driven portraits of their high school graduates. The Barr Foundation seeks proposals from local education agencies and community organizations in partnership with public high schools. Applicants must be interested in building a portrait of a graduate and an aligned action plan.</p>

<p>To significantly improve outcomes for students and graduates takes policy change and new practice. This requires community buy-in.  Building a portrait of a graduate brings students, families, school staff members, and committed partners from higher education, local employers, and others to the planning table. The diverse insights of community members are vital to developing a collective set of expectations for all high school graduates.</p>

547,Boston Globe to Deepen Reporting on Education,"<p>Building on the successful “Valedictorians Project,” a broadened journalistic effort aims to increase quantity and quality of coverage and public discussions about Boston’s public schools.</p>","<p>The “Build Public Will” strategy within <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/education-program-strategies"">Barr’s Education program</a> aims to engage parents and students, educators and civic leaders, and all residents as informed advocates for high-quality schools. For this reason, along with many others, we were engaged by the Boston Globe’s <a href=""https://apps.bostonglobe.com/magazine/graphics/2019/01/17/valedictorians/""><em>Valedictorians Project</em></a>. The series featured stories of 93 valedictorians from Boston public high schools, and the paths they took after graduation. “[They] set off to change the world,” it began. “But good grades only got them so far.”  </p>

<p>With the publication of the <em>Valedictorians Project</em>, the Globe powerfully humanized the challenges and inequities built into our system. It also sparked numerous public conversations at live forums throughout Boston and online. Based on this response, and in light of the ongoing importance of understanding the complexities related to our education system, the Globe decided to expand its education coverage with the creation of <a href=""https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/education/k-12/education-project/"">The Education Project</a>, a two-year effort to deepen reporting and facilitate public engagement related to education in Boston.</p>

<p>To complement its own investments in this expanded effort, the Globe approached Barr for support. Following discussions over the past several months, we are pleased to announce that the Foundation is awarding a $600,000 grant over the next 24 months to support two new journalists: one education reporter and one data journalist/analytics specialist. Barr’s support will also enable a “freelance fund” to cover costs of related reporting.</p>

<p>As we have shared on our blog in the past, a significant body of research has made it clear that Boston is far from providing all children with access to a high-quality school. Last year, <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/new-report-details-challenges-facing-boston-s-public-high-schools"">I wrote about the Barr-funded EY-Parthenon study, Excellence and Equity for All</a>. This report detailed the status of high school students in the Boston Public Schools. It found great disparities in the quality of high schools. It also found that a student’s chances of graduating can vary as much as 30 percentage points, depending on the high school they attend. <a href=""https://www.successboston.org/research?q&sortBy=date&sortOrder=desc&page=1"">A recent report from the Success Boston Initiative</a> found many students who graduate high school are not college-ready. Six years after graduation, only 38 percent of Boston’s graduating class of 2011 had obtained a postsecondary credential.</p>

<p>From time to time, Barr has invested in media efforts related to our core programs and region. Recent examples include support for WBUR’s <a href=""https://www.wbur.org/artery"">ARTery</a> and MassINC’s <a href=""https://commonwealthmagazine.org/category/arts-and-culture/"">Commonwealth Magazine</a>, to bolster coverage of arts and creativity in Massachusetts, or for <em>Hechinger Report</em>’s “<a href=""https://hechingerreport.org/special-reports/map-to-the-middle-class/"">Map to the Middle Class</a>” – a special report on secondary schools that help students succeed in college, career, and life.</p>

<p>As with all of these other efforts, and following best practices for philanthropic support of media organizations, the Foundation will have no input into the content of the Globe’s coverage. This “editorial firewall” is written into our grant agreement with the Globe and will be noted on the project’s dedicated website.</p>

<p>As with <a href=""https://apps.bostonglobe.com/spotlight/boston-racism-image-reality/"">the Globe’s series on racism in Boston</a> in December 2017, <em>The Valedictorian Project</em> struck a nerve locally and stimulated a larger conversation about public education. We believe the Globe is uniquely positioned to keep this issue front and center, to deepen public knowledge, inform civic leaders and policymakers as they advance solutions, and inspire a community-wide conversation about our boldest aspirations for public education. We are excited to see the resulting work and impact.</p>

<p><em>As this new effort begins, The Globe wants to hear from the community. To learn more about The Globe’s education coverage and to lend your ideas, <a href=""https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/education/k-12/education-project/"">sign up here</a>.</em></p>"
546,It's Time to Prioritize Equity in Massachusetts' Energy Efficiency Programs,<p>Alex Papali of Clean Water Action calls for collaborative action to ensure that the Commonwealth's energy efficiency programs support access for all communities.</p>,"<p>For the eighth consecutive year, the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE) <a href=""https://www.masssave.com/en/about/news-and-events/News/massachusetts-ranked-number-one-in-energy-efficiency-for-eight-consecutive-year/"">ranked</a> Massachusetts&#39; efficiency programs, known as Mass Save, the top US performer. This seal of excellence, however, lacks a focus on stubborn areas of consistent poor performance among all the accolades. These <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/timely-new-report-shows-substantial-differences-in-energy-savings-among-massachusetts-towns"">problem areas</a> involve ratepayers from low-to-moderate income households, renters and non-English speakers – all groups disproportionately composed of people of color - and therefore point to a <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/timely-new-report-shows-substantial-differences-in-energy-savings-among-massachusetts-towns"">classic case of environmental injustice</a>.</p>

<p>State law requires all cost-effective efficiency measures be implemented before investment in new supply. But perennial barriers to access by these underserved ratepayers, often concentrated in smaller cities like Holyoke or Brockton, or specific neighborhoods like Main South in Worcester, raise serious questions about whether Massachusetts’ programs meet that mandate. After all, how can a program that captures all cost-effective measures persistently fall short on equitable distribution of those measures?</p>

<p>That’s a question that all stakeholders came together to address during development of the most recent statewide efficiency plan. After years of discussions, advocates, members of the state’s Energy Efficiency Advisory Council (EEAC), program consultants and the utilities that run Mass Save finally coalesced around a creative solution: a novel ‘renter metric’ and an agreement to base part of the utilities’ performance incentive on performance in serving renters. Despite unanimous approval by the EEAC, the Department of Public Utilities unexpectedly and unilaterally removed this mechanism, calling it unnecessary. And just like that, a year of careful work to fix a long-standing problem evaporated. Next week, you can add your voice to the call for equity at the upcoming EEAC meeting.</p>

<p>Those excluded from the program’s promised benefits have been organized and vocal since 2008. The Green Justice Coalition’s (GJC) grassroots members have demonstrated program flaws and advocated for innovative solutions through original research and organizing. Failure to reach these customers, who pay into the program via fees on each month’s utility bills poses a major equity concern, and leaves significant climate opportunities on the table.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--reach""> <p>to</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>GJC research found that nearly 40% of residents above the low-income category (which is governed by a separate system) fall into the moderate-income segment: 60-120% of State Median Income (SMI).  Reaching this population may require new methods, such as educational programs in partnership with municipalities and trusted and skilled local community groups, but they clearly have an important role to play in any effective climate mitigation strategy (not to mention it’s only fair the program serve them as well as wealthier customers).</p>

<p>Renters are concentrated in urban areas, home to the vast majority of communities of color. In Chelsea for example, renters comprise 75% of residents, many of whom additionally face language barriers. This means large shares of communities of color effectively remain outside the program. Meanwhile, their participation is becoming increasingly essential as emissions savings from low-hanging fruit like LED lighting reach market saturation. Applied Economics Clinic has found that <a href=""https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5936d98f6a4963bcd1ed94d3/t/5c9a80a241920292c84dea48/1553629347108/Note+on+Emissions+Saved+by+100%2C000+Renters+Formatted+03-08-2019.pdf"">including even 100,000 renters</a> in the programs could lead to reducing carbon dioxide emissions by over 300,000 tons over the course of a three-year plan.</p>

<p>There are a few bright spots in the plan. It does allow a portion of moderate-income households (60%-80% of SMI) to receive a 100% subsidy of their efficiency costs, with no ceiling.  Access also may improve for some facing linguistic isolation, with new customer support for additional languages.  For the first time, the plan requires consistent utility collection and reporting of program data sorely lacking in the past: renter status, income level and primary language. And the plan increases support for cost-effective air-source and ground-source heat pumps across utilities.</p>

<p>There are real victories to celebrate in this plan, but hard work remains on achieving equity. That hard work starts now. The June 19 meeting of the <a href=""http://ma-eeac.org/"">EEAC</a> at 100 Cambridge Street will focus on renters and moderate income ratepayers. Show up and stand up for equity by attending the meeting and calling for a more equitable Mass Save.

545,Strengthening School Leadership in Massachusetts ,<p>New report examines challenges and opportunities for ensuring every school has an effective principal.</p>,"<p>School leaders are integral to student achievement and school success. This is true in large and small schools. It is true in rural and urban schools. It is true across traditional public districts, public charter organizations, and independent schools. Every school and student benefits from an effective principal. Yet, the goal of having an effective principal in every school is elusive.</p>

<p>Finding and keeping high-quality principals is always a challenge. These challenges are only exacerbated in schools that struggle to support all students. In 2017, fifty-six percent of newly-hired Massachusetts principals had never held a principal role before. Schools with the highest percentage of students experiencing poverty were also most likely to be led by novice principals.</p>

<p>To better understand what contributes to this challenge, and what potential solutions may be, the Barr Foundation assembled a dedicated group of Massachusetts district leaders, state education leaders, charter management organization leaders, and education funders. We engaged <a href=""https://attunedpartners.com/"">Attuned Education Partners</a> to facilitate a collective research and learning process into the challenges, exemplary approaches, and opportunities to advance positive change related to the principalship. Through that process, the group identified four challenges to strengthening the principalship that are underscored by research:</p>

<ul>
<li>The type and quality of training new principals receive.</li>
<li>Factors contributing to (and limiting) diversity of principal candidates.</li>
<li>On-the-job coaching.</li>
<li>The principal’s scope of responsibilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Drawing on published research, publicly-available data on Massachusetts school leaders, and the working group’s own experiences (including knowledge of successful approaches), we are pleased to release this new report: <em>Strengthening School Leadership in Massachusetts.</em></p>

<p>At the Barr Foundation, our <a href=""http://www.barrfoundation.org/education"">Education Program</a> is rooted in the belief that all young people can succeed in learning, work, and life. We support efforts throughout New England that are led by educators, parents and community partners, who share this view, and who are working to expand access to schools that make that vision a reality. We are inspired by leaders whose schools are models of what it looks like to support all students to be successful. We hope this new research helps illuminate why such leaders have been in short supply in Massachusetts, and what some of the opportunities are to change that.</p>"
544,Boston Needs to Invest in a New Generation of Artists,"<p>This article was originally published in the Opinion section of The Boston Globe on June 6, 2019.</p>","<p>It is often said that “demography is destiny.” As detailed in a recent <a href=""https://www.bostonindicators.org/changingfaces"">Boston Foundation report</a>, “The Changing Faces of Greater Boston,” our region is undergoing an extraordinary demographic change. Take just one data point: every one of Greater Boston’s 147 cities and towns has experienced an increase in its nonwhite population since 1990. We also know from all too many incidents over the past 30 years, <a href=""https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/05/23/racism-allegations-puts-museum-fine-arts-spotlight/nz93s1AR2Hw3boixFHAqQI/story.html?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link"">most recently at the Museum of Fine Arts</a>, that changing demographics do not, on their own, make communities more welcoming, inclusive, respectful, and caring of each other. That requires intentionality. And it is one of the many reasons arts and creativity are so vital.</p>

<p>Our two foundations — The Boston Foundation and Barr Foundation — focus on a range of issues influenced by these demographic shifts, such as education, health, climate change, economic development, and housing. But we also focus on the arts as an essential issue.
<blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--do""> <p>demographics</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>The past decades have seen a wave of diverse new talents emerge, bringing new elements of arts and culture to the wider region. But despite our longstanding status as a city of world-class arts institutions, <a href=""https://www.tbf.org/%7E/media/TBFOrg/Files/Reports/Arts%20Report_Jan%207%202016.pdf"">Boston Foundation research</a> has shown that Boston has neglected our smaller organizations. Relative to other cities, we have not prioritized investment in an arts ecosystem that could elevate the new perspectives we so urgently need.</p>

<p>For this reason, three years ago, our foundations supported <a href=""http://plan.bostoncreates.org/"">Boston Creates</a>, Mayor Marty Walsh’s effort to develop the city’s first-ever cultural plan. The resulting community process engaged more than 5,000 Bostonians and gave shape to a collective vision of a city where opportunities to create, connect, and be inspired are abundant, sustainable, and accessible to all.</p>

<p>Among Boston Creates’ five overarching goals was an aspiration to “keep artists in Boston and attract new ones here, recognizing and supporting artists’ essential contribution to creating and maintaining a thriving, healthy, and innovative city.” In response, the city has led by doubling the Boston Cultural Council budget, and by launching an Artist’s Resource Desk and new programs for artists — such as the Artist Fellowship Award, Boston Artist in Residence Program, Opportunity Fund, and “Percent for Art Program,” which dedicates 1 percent of the city’s capital borrowing budget to commission public art.</p>

<p>In alignment with these efforts, our foundations in 2016 launched Live Arts Boston, offering grants of up to $15,000 to individual artists and small companies to produce and perform new works. We announced the most recent round of awards last month. To date, LAB has made 186 grants, totaling more than $2.3 million. LAB has also provided over $500,000 to support recipients of LAB grants to strengthen their networks and develop the business and other skills that artists need to achieve their career goals.</p>

<p>What the producers and performers have been able to do with this funding is remarkable. Ellice Patterson, executive director of <a href=""https://www.abilitiesdance.org/"">Abilities Dance</a>, produced the first-ever run of full-length shows by the organization, which promotes dance for individuals with and without disabilities. Global jazz group <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/TrioMixcla"">MIXCLA</a>, comprising Berklee College of Music alums from Chile, Japan, and Cuba, released their first full-length album and promptly garnered a Boston Music Awards nomination.

<p>We could add dozens of other examples. These artists represent the new Boston. More than 70 percent of the funded projects are led by artists of color. They come from places, nations, and backgrounds that have often been underrepresented in Greater Boston’s arts ecosystem. A third had never applied for or received a grant. Bostonians have now experienced over 1,000 performances of their works.</p>

<p>Investments in the arts are investments in our civic infrastructure. They elevate new voices and perspectives that capture Boston’s dynamism and diversity. When we expand the resources available for these artists too, we make it possible for more artists to thrive, and to foster more vibrant, inclusive, and engaged communities.</p>

<p>We have made progress, but we are not done. For Boston to join places like New York, Los Angeles, Austin, or Memphis as an attractive place for artists to do their work and build their careers, it will require greater investment and committed partnership from individuals, philanthropy, government, and the private sector.</p>

<p>Boston is among few cities that can count on a united commitment to the arts from their leading community foundation and one of their largest private foundations. We are also fortunate to have a strong tradition of giving to the arts from generous individuals, and to have leadership at City Hall committed to sparking an “arts and culture renaissance” in Boston. These are assets to build upon. Yet, to ensure that our ever-changing communities remain creative, vibrant, and inclusive, we must prioritize the arts — and lift up a new generation of artists — as a key dimension of our region’s strength.</p>

543,A Renaissance for Creativity in Essex County ,"<p>Progress, projects, and early lessons from Essex County Community Foundation, two years in to its Creative County Initiative.</p>","<p>It’s hard to believe that only 12 months ago, the Essex County Community Foundation (ECCF) publicly launched our first major effort in the arts. Leading up to that moment, with support from the Barr Foundation through the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/creative-commonwealth"">Creative Commonwealth Initiative</a> and our many local donors, ECCF spent a year convening and learning how to best invest in our region’s artists, art nonprofits, and local and regional cultural planning efforts. Now, the <a href=""http://eccf.org/creative-county"">Creative County Initiative</a> is fully underway. Our efforts are moving fast and gaining traction in more ways than we ever imagined possible. We have spent time learning from and engaging with the arts, culture, and creativity ecosystem in our region and our efforts are stronger because of this partnership work. This post offers a glimpse of our efforts to date. It previews some of the exciting things coming this year. We also share some of our most important lessons so far.</p>
<h3>Cultural Planning Labs</h3>
<p>Through a partnership with the Metropolitan Area Planning Council and the Merrimack Valley Planning Commission, we completed four “Cultural Planning Labs.” These introduced cultural planning concepts and resources to all 34 Essex County communities. Over 130 municipal leaders, town planners, and nonprofit leaders attended. The five key learnings from these sessions were:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Creative County Initiative has effectively catalyzed a new conversation about community culture among local leaders from arts and culture, government, business, and philanthropy leaders.</li>
<li>Advancing cultural initiatives and equity requires this kind of cross-sector leadership. It also takes a base of operations – a role ECCF is uniquely suited to play. </li>
<li>The region’s arts and culture ecosystem is ready and able to provide coordination, technical assistance, and support to all areas of community development.</li>
<li>The region’s arts and culture sector can benefit from templates, toolkits, and trainings. These will enable the sector to share best practices, processes, and program prototypes.</li>
<li>Future Creative County Initiative work can spark new funding from new sources for community-driven arts and culture.</li>
</ol>

<p>This spring, ECCF will further its work with the two regional planning agencies, to develop new models for regional cultural asset-mapping and shared community arts staffing, and to provide technical assistance support for communities ready to commence cultural planning initiatives.</p>
<h3>EssexCountyCreates.org – A New Arts and Culture Calendar</h3>
<p>With over 180 arts and culture organizations, venues, and artists registered, and over 2,000 social media followers, <a href=""http://www.essexcountycreates.org/"">essexcountycreates.org</a> is becoming a go-to resource for Essex County. A major public launch in March 2019 included promotion on thirteen billboards.</p>
<h3>Public Art and Placemaking Grants</h3>
<p>In 2018, we planned, funded, and scheduled 12 projects that are launching this year. Each features a partnership of arts and culture, business, philanthropic, and government leaders - all working together to foster community identity, to strengthen our regional arts and culture ecosystem, and to contribute to safe, healthy, connected communities. Details on all projects can be found at <a href=""http://www.essexcountycreates.org/"">essexcountycreates.org</a>.</p>

<em>A map of Creative County Initiative public art and creative placemaking events.</em></p>

<p>Here is a bit about each of the twelve:</p>

<ol>
<li>Co-Creating Culture – a mural and light installation celebrating Lawrence’s past, present, and future at Lawrence Public Library.</li>
<li>Pow wows hosted in Danvers and Hamilton by the Massachusetts Native American Awareness Association.</li>
<li>Artists in residence from Tape Art creating hundreds of life-sized silhouettes depicting residents from this century or the last will be found throughout the tri-town communities of Groveland, Merrimac, and West Newbury.</li>
<li>Artist Shanties built by the community in Newburyport to provide space for artists and artisans to show, perform, or make their work along the waterfront. </li>
<li>“Switch Rideable Artscape” – a performance platform, outdoor art studio and gallery, and a rideable concrete canvas for boarders and skaters of all ages and abilities in Bialek Park, Ipswich.</li>
<li>A new project led by the Essex Shipbuilding Museum working with residents and students to build classic clamming baskets, and a skiff they’ll launch at the end of May.</li>
<li>“CuriousCity” – a new children’s museum of art and industry in Peabody.</li>
<li>Downtown Lynn activated by portable, flexible public “parklets,” created by a dynamic partnership including Beyond Walls and the City of Lynn.</li>
<li>A multidisciplinary art and augmented reality installation in Salem’s Point neighborhood to carry the voices of immigrants who have lived and worked there, past and present.</li>
<li>“Crossing Water Festival” - a week of arts and creative programming to activate the waterfront on both sides of the Salem-Beverly Bridge.</li>
<li>New public murals that will cover two large exterior walls of Beverly’s Cabot Theatre. </li>
<li>Illumination of the Ayer Mills Clock Tower and a celebration of movement and light along the river and canal of downtown Lawrence.</li>
</ol>

<p>We have been fascinated by the learnings arising from these demonstration projects.  The most significant by-product we see is the cultivation of ideas and relationships that spur continued collaboration and work past the “project date” in  many of these efforts. Future projects and community transformation is being generated before our very eyes.</p>
<h3>2nd Annual Essex County Arts and Culture Summit</h3>
<p>On September 27, ECCF will host our second annual arts and culture summit. This year, our focus will be diversity, equity and inclusion; cultural space development; and plans for the next phase of Creative County Initiative projects. For more information, visit ECCF’s <a href=""http://eccf.org/arts-summit"">arts summit page</a>.</p>

<p>Supporting all of this work is Creative County Initiative’s terrific Steering Committee. They are now both evaluating our first two years and helping us shape the work ahead. We are so grateful for their partnership with us, and for ECCF’s opportunity to participate in the Creative Commonwealth Initiative. And we are excited about the many ways we will continue to deepen and broaden the impacts of arts and creativity in our communities for years to come.</p>

538,New Poll Seeks Ideas About Public High Schools in New England,"<p>To understand opportunities and challenges in schools and communities, perspectives from students, parents, teachers, and principals are essential.</p>","<p>Barr’s Education Program is rooted in the belief that all students can graduate high school fully prepared for whatever comes next. For all high schools in New England to make that vision a reality requires careful listening to those who know our schools best – students, teachers, principals, and parents.</p>

<p>This is why Barr recently partnered with Beacon Research, a Boston-based market and opinion research firm. We wanted to build understanding of how high school parents, students, teachers and principals across New England feel about their schools, and their ideas and priorities for improving them. After conducting a series of interviews and focus groups, Beacon Research developed a poll that is being administered this spring and summer. We will make the results publicly available in the fall, so they can be a resource to others in the field. We will also use the findings to inform Barr’s education work.</p>

<p>We look forward to hearing these incredibly important perspectives. The polls have now been closed and we offer our thanks to all participants for their time and engagement.</p>
<h3>About the Barr Foundation’s Education Program</h3>
<p>The Barr Foundation’s Education Program is committed to rigorous, personalized education so that all young people have real opportunities to thrive. We focus on the high school years and do work across three strategies:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Catalyze New Models</em>: Fuel fresh designs that fit local contexts and transform the high school experience, to put success within reach of all students.</li>
<li><em>Build Public Will</em>: Engage parents, students, educators, civic leaders, and all residents, as informed advocates for high-quality schools.</li>
<li><em>Invest in Educators</em>: Develop the pipeline of diverse, skilled, effective teachers and school leaders who bring new educational models to life for their students.</li>
</ul>

537,Podcasting for All,"<p>Alex Birch, Senior Manager of the PRX Podcast Garage, discusses the rising power of this medium to build partnerships and create new models for community storytelling in Boston.</p>","<blockquote>
<p><em>“There&#39;s really no such thing as the &#39;voiceless.&#39; There are only the deliberately silenced, or the preferably unheard.”</em><br>
-Arundhati Roy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Podcasting is on the rise. Over 700,000 podcasts are available in iTunes with an estimated 90 million monthly listeners globally. No single entity controls podcasts, which means they are an accessible, decentralized, and democratized way to create content. Today, on-demand audio has dramatically transformed the way important stories and unheard voices reach us.</p>

<p>At PRX, we believe in the power of audio storytelling. New ways of telling stories, like podcasting, can build empathy, change minds and transform communities. <strong>Through our work at the <a href=""https://www.podcastgarage.org/"">PRX Podcast Garage</a>, we are offering tools, training and space for people who want to work in this medium - regardless of age, technical background, or media experience.</strong> When we began our journey (with early funding from the Barr Foundation), we had an empty renovated auto body shop on Western Avenue in Allston - the PRX Podcast Garage - and an ambitious vision to transform it into a hub of community and creativity for media makers in Boston.</p>

<p>The Podcast Garage is now a thriving community space where hobbyists and professionals come to refine their craft, master new technologies, and create the most meaningful work they can. In 2018, we hosted over 100 classes and events with thousands of people coming through our doors. This year, PRX worked with Google to open our doors to <a href=""https://medium.com/prxofficial/meet-our-six-inaugural-teams-for-the-google-podcasts-creator-program-935326a630b2"">global podcasters</a> representing perspectives from the Philippines, Chile, Nairobi, and beyond.</p>

<p>It was clear to us we needed to not only build training and resources to serve the local community in Allston, but we also needed to incorporate a larger network strategy to replicate, scale, and take on the road. The desired outcome: to radically expand access to podcasting and change the face of the medium, by providing access and training, starting right here in Boston. So we set out to create a podcast training program just as accessible and decentralized as the medium of podcasting itself.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--to""> <p>hope</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>First, we collaborated with <a href=""http://reveledup.com/"">ReveledUp</a> on a rigorous six-month process of community asset mapping. We looked for mission-aligned organizations that had the capacity and desire to learn more about how podcasting could be a platform to elevate stories within their communities. During that process, we met incredible organizations that we can work with on our path towards accessibility and representation.</p>
<h3>ACCESS IN ACTION</h3>
<p>Our facility in Allston, while open to all, is not easily reachable by all. To expand our reach into other parts of the city, we saw a model in <a href=""https://grubstreet.org/"">GrubStreet</a> - an organization that works with artists in a different medium, with a similar mission. We met with staff at GrubStreet to learn from their experiences creating access points for writers across the city. Following their lead, we’re offering classes at Boston Public Library branches and developing online courses for podcasters in Boston and beyond.</p>

<p>Working in library branches across the city raises a different set of questions: How do we keep our training consistent across spaces? What does staffing and teaching look like outside of our Allston facility? How do we find participants in new neighborhoods and provide venues to share their stories?</p>

<p>To start, we created a curriculum, instructor guides, and media resources so that we could bring the same high-quality experiences to participants all over the city. We also selected a partner organization in each neighborhood - identified during our community asset mapping - to help us do outreach and integrate their programs. For our pilot in East Boston and Codman Square, these partners are <a href=""https://www.zumix.org/"">Zumix</a>, an East Boston-based organization offering award-winning youth programming in music and creative technology, and <a href=""https://www.ujimaboston.com/"">Boston Ujima Project</a>, a Dorchester-based collective to organize and strengthen low-income communities and communities of color.</p>

<h3>REPRESENT!</h3>
<p>Simply put: we want the stories being recorded, performed, and amplified at the Podcast Garage to reflect all residents of Boston. This means gathering members of local organizations, asking them key questions about their needs, and then listening closely. It also means going to meet people where they are, in places where they are already telling stories, and informing them about our space, what we offer, and where they can find us.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--we""> <p>put</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>An illustration of that work is our partnership with <a href=""https://www.futuromediagroup.org/"">Futuro Media</a> on the Community Podcast Lab, where a group of women of color ranging in age from 22 to 70 came from neighborhoods across Boston to learn the art of audio storytelling through podcasting. The tagline for this project was: “If you don’t tell your story, someone else will tell it for you.”</p>

<p>From the <a href=""https://bcnc.net/pao"">Pao Arts Center</a> in Chinatown, we also heard a distinct need for support in storytelling around important issues facing the community like immigration and gentrification. The staff there had heard these issues echoed in conversations with the owners of <a href=""https://www.dudleycafe.com/"">Dudley Cafe</a>, a community gathering space in Roxbury. From these conversations, we developed an ongoing series, “Personal Storytelling for Social Change” - connecting participants from the Dorchester, Roxbury, and Chinatown neighborhoods. After a free four-week training, the stories told by participants were performed live and recorded. We’re already planning to offer the popular series again this fall in other languages.</p>

<p>Boston needs more spaces where we can come together to make meaning of what is happening in the world and in our lives. There are far too many voices unheard in our local and national conversations. And, while the first PRX Podcast Garage was built in Boston, we’re now taking our garages national. PRX plans to launch a similar space in Washington D.C. in the coming months and in other locations in the coming years.  </p>

534,Everyone Counts: How Nonprofits Can Help Ensure a Full 2020 Census Count,<p>Data from the 2020 Census will have long-term implications for Massachusetts in the next decade. Nonprofits can play an active role in Census outreach to help ensure an accurate count.</p>,"<p>April 1 marked the beginning of the one-year countdown to the 2020 Census. The decennial Census is one of the most important activities that we undertake collectively in this country. It drives big decisions about funding and power. Even more fundamentally, it is an opportunity to make real the belief that animates and unites the nonprofit sector—that everyone counts.</p>

<p>For our part, the Massachusetts Nonprofit Network (MNN) is proud to work on this important issue with government and community leaders as a member of the statewide Complete Count Committee hosted by Secretary of the Commonwealth Bill Galvin. We also are a partner organization of the <a href=""https://www.masscensusequity.org/"">Massachusetts Census Equity Fund</a>, a statewide funding collaborative including philanthropic and civic engagement organizations working to increase participation in the 2020 Census.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--is""> <p>census</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Census data determines political representation at the federal, state, and local levels. It also drives more than $16 billion in federal funds to Massachusetts every year. Data from the 2020 Census will have a major impact on all types of nonprofits in the Commonwealth and the millions of people that rely on their work, and even on neighbors and residents beyond nonprofits’ immediate circles.</p>

<p>Despite the importance of the Census, certain populations in Massachusetts have historically been undercounted. These communities include urban and rural areas with large populations of low-income residents, people of color, immigrants, non-English speakers, young children, the elderly, renters, and those experiencing homelessness. If the 2020 Census doesn’t collect accurate data on these undercounted groups in particular, then they and the communities they live in won’t receive their fair share of critical federal resources and services.</p>

<p>While thoughtful preparation for the Census is always important, a unique set of challenges to a complete count in 2020 makes outreach more important than ever. The 2020 Census will be administered mostly online, raising cybersecurity and internet access concerns. In addition, the federal government’s attempts to include a citizenship question unnecessarily compounds the climate of fear felt in immigrant communities and threatens their participation. Finally, federal resources are limited: Massachusetts will have six Area Census Offices for the 2020 count, compared with 10 in 2010, and none west of Worcester this time.</p>

<p>Given these challenges, the nonprofit sector’s participation in the Census is needed now more than ever. As trusted messengers, nonprofits are uniquely qualified to help address concerns people may have about participating and to assist them in doing so.</p>

<p>Here are three key actions that nonprofits can take—starting today—to ensure a complete count in 2020:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Conduct direct outreach and raise public awareness.</strong> Nonprofits can use their communications channels and public spaces to convey the importance of Census participation to their communities. Visit MNN&#39;s <a href=""https://www.massnonprofitnet.org/2020census/"">2020 Census page</a> for a list of outreach resources and post to social media using the hashtag <a href=""https://twitter.com/search?q=%23MassCounts&src=typd"">#MassCounts</a> to add to a growing movement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Connect with Complete Count Committees.</strong> Complete Count Committees are established by local governments and community leaders to organize local and regional outreach efforts. Visit the <a href=""https://www.sec.state.ma.us/census2020/complete-count.html"">Complete Count website</a> to find and join the nearest committee.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Educate public officials about the importance of the Census.</strong> Public officials at all levels of government have a stake in ensuring a complete count in 2020. As nonprofits reach out about the Census to leaders in the communities they serve, they should include elected officials, who are often in unique positions to help spread the word.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>With a broad coalition of nonprofit, philanthropy, government, and community partners carrying the message about the importance of Census participation, Massachusetts can achieve a complete count in 2020—giving new meaning to our common belief that everyone counts.</p>

533,Public Art is Alive and Well in Boston Neighborhoods,"<p>After piloting the Creative City program for three years, San San Wong and Cathy Edwards share what we learned and what is next for supporting arts in the public realm.</p>","<p>Creative City put the &quot;public&quot; back in public art in Boston. It began in 2015 as Boston was undergoing a cultural planning process (<a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/when-artists-are-at-the-intersection-of-planning-and-community"">Boston Creates</a>) and there was a revived energy and interest for more arts in our city. Barr and the New England Foundation for the Arts (NEFA) came together and thought “Why not put money in the hands of artists to spark projects that would inspire public imagination?” <div class=""Media -aside -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img alt=""map of Boston neighborhoods"" class=""Media-image"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2920/crop_preview.png?1642124882"" /> </div> </div>We wanted to present artists with opportunities to reimagine places for art and exercise their creative power to engage Boston residents.</p>

<p>Creative City, run by NEFA with support from the Barr Foundation, provided modest-sized grants to artists, along with professional development, community partnerships, and network-building opportunities. Over three years, Creative City funded 46 projects across 16 Boston neighborhoods, with two-thirds led by artists of color. Projects explored an impressive array of artistic disciplines, including film, music, performing arts, textiles, and written word.  </p>
<h3>What We Learned</h3>
<p>Through Creative City projects, we saw neighborhoods activated as public art studios. Basketball courts turned into dance floors and parks turned into theaters. Residents from nearly every neighborhood gathered in public spaces to co-create with artists, share stories, and reflect on their neighborhood’s cultural history. We learned that investing in socially-engaged artists is a powerful way to spark important public conversations and drive community change, contributing to a stronger city overall.

Through Creative City, Kerry Thompson offered monthly salsa in the park dance lessons to fellow DeafBlind community members. Entitled <em>Movement to Move the Marginalized from the Margins</em>, Kerry saw her project as a vehicle to promote the inclusion of marginalized communities to all arts and recreational activities. “You can have a dialogue that doesn’t have to be about the disability,” Kerry said. “It’s about the art.”</p>

<p>Nonprofit theater organization, Escena Latina Teatro hosted <em>Teatro En El Parque/Theater In The Park</em>, an evening of free outdoor theater presented in Spanish and English, with translations via supertitles. “It’s amazing to see that we are able to transform the place in such a small amount of time,&quot; said Juan Pedro Paniagua, founder, actor and director. &quot;It becomes, I think, overall more welcoming and also more interesting for people.” Watch the video below to learn more about this project.</p>

Creative City projects influenced change in ways that go beyond the immediate impacts of a mural, a neighborhood performance, or an installation. The model resulted in positive outcomes for the artist, the community partner, the community, and the field at large. Among them: <div class=""Media -aside -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img alt=""Graphic showing the model of the Creative City public art program"" class=""Media-image"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2917/crop_preview.png?1642124859"" /> </div> </div></p>

<ul>
<li>Artists expanded their practice by taking risks, both artistically and as producers of community experience. </li>
<li>Art projects were building blocks for transformative community and neighborhood change.</li>
<li>Art projects influenced public spaces, conversations, and perceptions of art.<br></li>
<li>Boston’s diverse communities, cultural expressions, and artists received creative opportunities, spotlight, and resources that advanced the goal of cultural equity. </li>
</ul>

<p>A full assessment of the program along with stories of several projects are now available through a <a href=""https://www.nefa.org/CreativeCityLearning"">Creative City report and video series</a> found on NEFA’s website. In addition, Barr partnered with Americans for the Arts’ Animating Democracy team to assess how Creative City compares to other programs supporting arts in the public realm across the country. <a href=""https://www.nefa.org/sites/default/files/documents/AFTA_report_f3_final_compressed.pdf"">The national field scan</a> looked at similarities and strengths of 30 public art programs, which we hope will serve as a resource to other funders and administrators interested in doing this work.</p>
<h3>What’s Next</h3>
<p>Barr and NEFA used the assessment of the pilot program and the national scan to inform what comes next for Creative City. We’re excited to announce that a $950,000 grant from the Barr Foundation will fund Creative City Boston, the next iteration of the program. Program design changes include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Increasing grant amounts for both artists (from up to $10,000 to up to $20,000) and community partners (from $1,000 to up to $5,000). </li>
<li>Introducing a concept proposal phase to lower the barrier for entry; finalists will receive feedback, technical assistance, and mentorship from advisors and staff prior to submitting a full project proposal.</li>
<li>Extending the cohort learning model to include both artists and community partners engaged in the awarded projects.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stay tuned for more information about Creative City Boston, including eligibility, criteria, and application timelines, which will be posted on NEFA’s website later this month.</p>

<p>We are thrilled to celebrate the last three years of work led by Creative City artists and look forward to continuing our support of public art in Boston by putting money directly in the hands of artists. We believe that when public spaces are activated by art, communities come alive, neighbors show up, and places previously marred by monotony are transformed into showcases of dynamic art.</p>

530,Four Lessons from Five Years Investing to Build Capacity in Boston’s Arts Sector,<p>Arts & Creativity Program Officer SueEllen Kroll shares key findings from newly-released evaluations.</p>,"<p>In 2012, Barr partnered with <a href=""https://klarmanfoundation.org/"">The Klarman Family Foundation</a> to strengthen Boston’s arts sector at a critical inflection point following the 2008 recession.  We designed the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/what-we-do/barr-klarman-massachusetts-arts-initiative"">Barr-Klarman Arts Capacity Building Initiative</a> based on the belief that when arts and cultural organizations are adequately capitalized with a healthy business model, they can build reserves that let them stay bold, experiment, and weather uncertainty. Together, we invested $22 million over five years in 30 Boston-based cultural organizations. We provided unrestricted funds, which we hoped would support organizations to improve their financial health and be nimble to respond to changes in the environment.</p>

<p>At the end of the five-year initiative, we wanted to understand what impact we had made. Were the organizations more financially stable? Did our trainings and curriculum meet the needs of our grantee partners? Was the composition of the grantee cohort correct? Were grantee partners positioned to benefit from the learning agenda? To answer these questions, the foundations commissioned two different evaluations – one looking at the Initiative’s design and participant experience; the other examining organizations’ balance sheet health. Our qualitative analysis included a nationwide landscape scan of similar capacity building programs as well as grantee surveys, interviews, and focus groups. Our financial health assessment compared balance sheets before and after the Initiative. We also looked for changes in organizational practice and financial literacy.</p>

<p>From our evaluation, we learned a lot about how to approach investing in the capitalization and adaptive capacity of arts organizations. Below, are four key lessons that stood out to us. </p>
<h3>Readily available capital allows arts organizations to take risks and experiment with new ideas.</h3>
<p>The foundations believe that for organizations to be innovative and nimble, they need to have the cash on hand to do what they want to do, when they want to do it. Despite <a href=""https://www.giarts.org/sites/default/files/capitalization-project_2010-summary.pdf"">capitalization studies</a> that emphasize the importance of unrestricted, multi-year support over the past decade, restricted funding, particularly project funding, continues to dominate the field of arts grantmaking. In our design of the Initiative, we posited that multi-year, unrestricted general operating support coupled with training and technical assistance around capitalization would best support positive changes in practice, such as building capital reserves through surpluses of unrestricted funds. While this held true, we also learned that we needed to further incentivize organizations to step outside their comfort zones into new ways of thinking about their work. In the final two years of the Initiative, we introduced a <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/arts-creativity/artistic-risk"">Fund for Artistic Risk</a> to provide organizations with even more latitude to experiment with new programs and approaches without the constant worry of making payroll or project failure. These funds were transformative for the organizations who received them as it gave them the permission to be bolder and more ambitious in their thinking.</p>

<p class=""tyler"">Watch seven stories of artistic risk-taking<a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/arts-creativity/artistic-risk%22%5D"">https://www.barrfoundation.org/arts-creativity/artistic-risk&quot;]</a></p>
<h3>Investing in board learning around financial health is key to changing organizational practice.</h3>
<p>Our experience has taught us that bold and adaptive organizations are propelled by boards of directors that understand capitalization and value organizational learning and improvement. As fiduciary stewards, boards set the tone for financial practice and are responsible for the long-term sustainability of organizations. Boards, along with organization leaders, must establish a capacity for risk-taking and innovation. However, boards are often risk adverse. In our planning, we sought to learn: how can we help board members become champions and advocates for capitalization and risk-taking? How can we best engage board members in the Initiative? While we required board members to attend our financial trainings with staff, we found that silo-ing these conversation to only a few board members (who are often the ones charged with understanding the organization’s finances anyway) didn’t necessarily impact the practices of the whole governing body. As a course adjustment, and to be responsive to organizations’ requests to reach more of their board members, we offered trainings during regularly scheduled board meetings. This way, we were not adding extra burdens to board volunteers, and we were able to ensure we were building knowledge across an entire board team. We also learned that board members were hungry for more opportunities to engage in conversations about what artistic risk-taking looks like for their organization. All too often, board members’ time together is focused on the organization’s finances, but without a clear artistic vision, target impact, or end goal. We opened up space for board members to engage in that conversation, and they shared with our evaluators how much they valued the opportunity.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--has""> <p>experience</p> </blockquote></p>
<h3>While some “off-the-shelf” trainings can work, customization is necessary to manage the diversity within a cohort.</h3>
<p>The most effective capacity-building programs are those that take into account participants’ nonprofit structure, community environment, and  stage of organizational development. Every organization enters into a cohort in a different place; therefore, a one-size-fits-all approach will not work for all. Within our cohort (of mid-size and youth arts mastery), we had a great deal of diversity across organizational size, capacity, complexity, business model, and audiences served. In designing the learning agenda for our Initiative, we learned that we didn’t test thoroughly enough for this range of experience in our application process. Coming into the Initiative, some organizations had done deep work and were already posting surpluses and/or creating reserves, while others were hearing about these ideas for the first time. We found that for those that had experience, our materials were not revelatory, and that we were more successful with those newer to the concepts. While we did offer some customization for those organizations who wished to pursue optional trainings, consultant opportunities, and our Fund for Artistic Risk, we learned that across the board, organizations would have benefited from more one-on-one technical assistance and thought partnership in planning and implementing their strategies over the course of the grant program.</p>
<h3>Cohort learning helps organizations build sector-wide networks and relationships toward a healthier ecosystem.</h3>
<p>Going into the Initiative, we had assumed some level of familiarity and connectivity across the leaders of Boston’s arts organizations. We quickly observed that with few exceptions this was not the case. Even within disciplines, organizational leaders (as well as staffs and boards) had few opportunities to connect with their peers or to see one another’s artistic work. The 2008 economic recession forced organizations to turn inward to focus on their own survival, and competition increased for limited resources. The Initiative’s cohort learning model supported the establishment and deepening of relationships in order to increase cohesion among our arts leaders. With a big learning agenda to get through, we had to be mindful of setting aside enough time for unplanned conversations and peer-to-peer connections to happen. Within networking, we also learned that we needed to pay closer attention to the design of the cohort itself -- to ensure that each organization had what they would consider another peer in the group.</p>
<h3>Looking ahead</h3>
<p>Barr and The Klarman Family Foundation are dedicated to improving the capitalization and nimbleness of arts organizations. In the fall of 2018, we renewed our partnership to continue our collaborative capacity-building work with a $25 million investment over six years in twenty-nine Massachusetts arts and cultural organizations. The new Initiative – the Barr-Klarman Massachusetts Arts Initiative – is grounded in three core concepts: capitalization, adaptive capacity, and cultural competency. We used the evaluations of the “Barr-Klarman Arts Capacity Building Initiative” to inform our planning to scale the Initiative across the state. The following recommendations and learning were incorporated into our design and application process for the new Initiative: </p>

<ul>
<li>At the onset, we established clear eligibility and selection criteria to surface eligible organizations; </li>
<li>We designed a 3-step application process, which included a 1) concept paper, 2) full application, and 3) site visits, to determine readiness and alignment among boards and staff leadership to tackle the Initiative’s learning agenda; </li>
<li>We extended the length of the Initiative from five to six years to give organizations another year to implement their capitalization strategies;</li>
<li>The Initiative’s first year is allocated as a diagnostic year in order to establish baselines and foundational training, and to further our learning about the cohort’s needs and strategic issues. This will then inform the design of a responsive  learning agenda and key supports to be offered over the six-year Initiative; and</li>
<li>We will provide more customized supports and services through one-on-one coaching. </li>
</ul>

<p>We have posted below the executive summaries for our qualitative and quantitative evaluations for those who wish to dive deeper into the methodology and results. While our evaluation results are promising, it is too soon to tell whether or not changes represent a moment in time or a sustainable shift for the organizations. We recognize that real changes in knowledge and practice take time.  It is our hope that this Initiative provided the organizations with a more solid foundation and new tools to support their goals. </p>

528,Smarter Ways to Use Data for Student-Centered Schools,"<p>Springpoint, a key partner in Barr’s Engage New England Initiative, reflects on three obstacles and three solutions for schools that want to more effectively use data to understand their students, and to design schools that are tailored to those needs, and that continuously adapt and improve.</p>","<p>“Data-based decision-making.” “Data-driven instruction.” These are now-familiar terms in the world of education. An emerging understanding of the power of data across various sectors continues to excite savvy and creative educators who see value in leveraging data-driven design. While there is not yet full-sector clarity and alignment regarding where an investment in data-based practices yields the strongest results, there is no question that schools better serve students when they understand the students they serve.</p>

<p>We take this maxim to heart at <a href=""http://www.springpointschools.org/"">Springpoint</a>, a national nonprofit that supports districts, networks, and charters to design innovative new high school models. We encourage our partners to adopt a curiosity mindset; to constantly ask “why” and seek deep insights about their students as a first step in the school design journey.</p>

<p>Using a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative data helps leaders gain a true understanding of the young people they serve, which in turn allows them to articulate students’ most critical needs and assets, and devise important programmatic responses in the design of school—especially for the most marginalized students. There is a perception that qualitative data is useful, but extremely hard to gather and analyze; in our work with schools and districts, we have found that gathering and manipulating quantitative data can be just as challenging. This article focuses on the barriers to collecting, analyzing, and using quantitative data in service of school design and discusses how districts and schools might start to address some of the technical challenges inherent in doing so.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--serve""> <p>better</p> </blockquote></p>
<h3>Understanding Root Causes of Student Performance</h3>
<p>Using data strategically and effectively allows leaders to leverage authentic opportunities that address students’ interests, strengths, and needs—and lets them continuously ensure that resource allocation and learning experiences are responsive to those needs and interests, as opposed to an assumed need or a fleeting education fad. In our work supporting school designers to develop school models for students who are off track to graduation as part of Barr Foundation’s <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/education/engage-new-england"">Engage New England initiative</a>, we have seen that when data is not readily available and easy to manipulate and digest, it can be hard to assess whether students are off track because of isolated skill gaps, challenges with English language acquisition, chronic absenteeism, or something else. Without access to or aptitude with raw data, leaders are left relying on anecdotal or surface level trends that can often misdiagnose the root causes of poor student performance. Such a misdiagnosis can point leaders toward solutions that do not address the most critical needs.</p>

<p>The following are some of the specific areas we have seen as obstacles in our work with practitioners at the school and district level:</p>
<h3>Challenge #1: Access to and Aptitude with Raw Data</h3>
<p>Quite often, student-level data files are only fully accessible at the district level and not by individual school leaders and staff. Even when accessible, data files may be unwieldy and available only through elaborate data portals. District data teams often understand their role as primarily providing information necessary for local, state, and federal accountability reporting. District data personnel are therefore more frequently focused on ensuring data is clean and ready for state reporting purposes than analyzing and packaging data for school-based personnel. Many school leaders would like to use data as a way to make decisions, but they do not always have the skills to use specific data tools or know how to draw conclusions, refine a hypothesis, and articulate meaningful research questions. District data teams’ roles rarely allow them to provide sufficient school-based training or prepare school-facing data reports. Therefore, even when school-based personnel have access to raw files, few have enough training in data practices to extract what they need.</p>
<h3>Challenge #2: State Reporting Limitations, Especially for Vulnerable Populations</h3>
<p>When data is collected exclusively for use by the state, it is cut and analyzed according to state requirements, which may leave important gaps especially pertaining to the most vulnerable sub-populations of students. For example, state-reported data might not include subgroups of demographic data when the number of students falls below a required sample size. Leaders, therefore, cannot identify or address significant trends. Say a school experiences an uptick in enrollment of English Language Learners but does not exceed the minimum threshold in a given year (e.g., 10 or 20 students per cohort), then year-to-year data will not be available regarding this group’s attendance, graduation, and state assessment outcomes. It may also be that important subgroups at a school are not defined in a traditional demographic sense. Natural groupings of students with similar characteristics and similar support needs may not be immediately apparent, such as previously incarcerated students or recent immigrants.</p>
<h3>Challenge #3: Systems Overload</h3>
<p>An increasingly pertinent issue in the education world is the lack of data interoperability—wherein systems are not set up to speak to one another. Even when systems are designed to make data gathering and analysis easier, inconsistent use can compound challenges. For example, schools often use multiple systems—perhaps there is one system for overall student enrollment information (SIS), one for benchmark or interim assessments, one for participation in state assessments, possibly a separate system for grading, attendance, or behavioral data tracking, and, increasingly, learning management systems that may or may not connect directly to the school’s SIS. Lack of data interoperability renders data-based decision-making arduous and unrealistic. While there are both local bright spots and nationally-focused companies and initiatives—like <a href=""https://www.projunicorn.org/"">Project Unicorn</a>, <a href=""https://www.ed-fi.org/"">Ed-fi Alliance</a>, and <a href=""https://www.illuminateed.com/news/five-way-merger-creates-new-illuminate-education/"">Illuminate Education</a>—that continue to work toward solutions, data interoperability challenges still cause confusion and frustration, all while taking up leaders’ precious time.</p>

<p>These are not insignificant challenges but solutions exist that could provide leaders with a baseline set of conditions for a student-centered, data-driven process.</p>
<h3>Solution #1: Re-Defining the Work of District Data Teams</h3>
<p>Districts must expand the vision of what their data teams can and should do beyond state reporting requirements. When districts cultivate a shared belief in the importance of getting data into the hands of school leaders, this data can be used as the basis of making and evaluating important decisions. In order to do this, districts need to build capacity for this work. That can include training programs as well as the direct development of key data cuts and analysis for leaders to leverage and employ. Through trainings and other engagements, district data experts can help schools understand that data-based practices are a not once-a-year occurrence. They can demonstrate why data-based cycles must be embedded in school practices throughout the year with a comprehensive understanding of what data is, how to collect and analyze it, and when to use it to inform decisions and assess progress toward goals.</p>
<h3>Solution #2: Systems Fixes</h3>
<p>Because the very systems that are designed to support data use often make it challenging, leaders can develop standard operating requirements for data systems and school-based data entry. District data experts can play an important liaison role between systems providers and schools, ensuring that key systems speak to one another and school leaders can extract the data they most need. Before implementing or purchasing a new system, districts must consider how the new product will interconnect with other systems. When possible, new products should reduce the overall number of unique systems to avoid overload, minimize training needs, and increase ease of access and usability of data.</p>
<h3>Solution #3: Finding the Right Data</h3>
<p>Along with access to and aptitude with data, leaders need to be able to ask the right questions that can surface useful answers, think creatively about how to source information, approach analyses from different angles to yield actionable insights, and develop the muscle that will allow them to apply the valuable information surfaced during inquiry cycles. At Springpoint, we conduct research visits alongside leaders, demonstrating how to execute robust inquiry cycles as a way to gather qualitative and quantitative data, which can inform nuanced conclusions that lead to community-specific solutions. We encourage and support leaders to be strategic about the grain size of their research questions within each inquiry cycle since that will help them find patterns, variation, and bright spots. Districts interested in supporting data-based practices need to ensure they cultivate the mindsets of curiosity and the skills of data analysis, and they need to allocate sufficient time for this in trainings and other professional development experiences.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--practices""> <p>data</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Effective data practices have the power to help districts and schools be more aware of trends in student performance. Once school leaders can see important patterns, they can be more strategic, intentional, and responsive. The existence of foundational data systems and practices is a crucial first step but schools also need training and support from the district level, easy access to the most important data sets and data cuts, and effective and efficient systems that speak to each other. Critical data practices, when done well, can elucidate a true understanding of students and their needs, which in turn fuels effective school design and continuous model improvement.</p>

527,Massachusetts Becomes First in the Nation to Put Batteries into Efficiency Plan,<p>Massachusetts' new energy efficiency program adds batteries to the mix. Clean Energy Group's project director breaks down the new policy and next steps.</p>,"<p>Energy storage has been the coming thing for years. Now, it has arrived – as an efficiency measure.</p>

<p>When the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (DPU) approved the state’s new three-year energy efficiency plan, known by many through <a href=""https://www.masssave.com/"">Mass Save</a>, it brought “behind-the-meter” energy storage into the program. Behind-the-meter is a shorthand description for energy storage that is installed on the customer&#39;s side of the meter, usually in the form of a battery.</p>

<p>Massachusetts is once again leading the nation on energy storage policy and advancing a generous new source of funding to support distributed battery deployment, but there is still room for improvement.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--once""> <p>is</p> </blockquote></p>
<h3>Batteries are included</h3>
<p>This marks the first time any state has included batteries in an energy efficiency plan. Making batteries eligible for energy efficiency programs opens a new and steady source of funding to pay incentives to customers that install batteries at their home, business or rental property. That’s critical because while few states have storage incentives, almost every state provides funding for energy efficiency programs. As a result, Massachusetts’ bold move could induce a &quot;Domino effect,&quot; creating a model for other states that want to jump-start energy storage markets.</p>

<p>Another key benefit is how this program will change the way customers think about their own energy use and savings. Customers who own or lease a battery system on their property will be paid incentives when they use the battery to reduce demand on the system, especially during times of peak demand. This program will be offered to commercial and residential customers for new battery installations (although a critical mass of residential customers from each area will have to sign up before the utilities issue contracts).</p>

<em>People explore recently installed behind-the-meter storage at their home. Image courtesy of <a href=""https://www.sunrun.com"">Sunrun</a>.</em></p>
<h3>Groundbreaking cost-benefit analysis</h3>
<p>How did this happen? <a href=""https://www.cleanegroup.org/"">Clean Energy Group</a> (CEG) contracted Liz Stanton of the Applied Economics Clinic (AEC) to present a first-of-its-kind analysis that showed the benefit-cost-ratio for energy storage and provided a sound basis for including it in the energy efficiency plan. All state energy efficiency plans undergo thorough review, including detailed cost-benefits analysis based on tests that vary by state. So this analysis should provide a basis for similar work in other states.</p>

<p>CEG and AEC have also, for the first time, calculated the non-energy benefits associated with energy storage. These benefits, such as job creation, reduced land use, reduced grid outages, and higher property values would have shown an even higher return on investment for energy storage, but no attempt was made to quantify them in the current plan. CEG will publish this work in April.</p>
<h3>Room for improvement</h3>
<p>Despite its important advances, the Massachusetts energy efficiency plan excluded some of the most promising energy storage incentives and program design elements—most importantly, those that would have supported storage for low-income communities.</p>

<p>The plan does not include any carve-outs or additional incentives or financing for low-income storage, which was a key recommendation from CEG. This is contrary to the state’s professed commitment to including low-income communities in its clean energy program offerings, and it is an issue that should have been addressed by the DPU. The DPU also limited the scale of a proposal for incentives that would have made batteries more affordable to residential customers and some commercial customers.</p>
<h3>Assessing the Impacts</h3>
<p>The 2019-2021 Energy Efficiency Plan includes some $13 million in customer incentive payments for energy storage. This unprecedented advance is expected to drive the installation of behind-the-meter batteries capable of storing 30-34 megawatts. That’s more than 15 times the amount of batteries currently installed in the state. That marks a significant change in the number of customers who can participate and the benefits batteries will generate.</p>

<p>There’s more work to be done, both in Massachusetts and in other states, but this new direction should be hailed by energy storage advocates as a pivotal moment in the development of state policy for behind-the-meter battery storage.</p>

<p>CEG will offer a free webinar to introduce their upcoming report on the inclusion of energy storage in the Massachusetts efficiency program. That webinar is scheduled for April 4.

526,Bold Aspirations for Boston’s Future,"<p>Highlights from a recent event at WBUR’s CitySpace, Boston’s newest home for civic discourse.</p>","<p>In <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/a-time-for-aspiration"">my first blog post of 2019</a>, I wrote about the imperative for aspiration. This is no time to be satisfied with the status quo or with incremental change. Our times and the challenges before us demand a combination of bold vision and concerted action. Indeed, this focus on aspiration serves as a key theme for us in our work at Barr.</p>

<p>In early February, we had the opportunity to explore this theme in greater depth with a diverse group of over 100 Boston leaders. As part of the opening of CitySpace, WBUR’s new venue for discussion about the important issues facing our city and region, we co-hosted an event with the theme: “What’s Our Aspiration? Moving Boston Forward.”</p>

<p>The evening’s program centered on a keynote speech by Eric Klinenberg, author of <a href=""https://www.ericklinenberg.com/books#palaces-for-the-people-how-social-infrastructure-can-help-fight-inequality-polarization-and-the-decline-of-civic-life"">Palaces for the People</a>. Eric described his research into “social infrastructure” – a term that describes a community’s gathering and meeting spaces, such as public libraries – and how much this infrastructure contributes to vibrancy, connection, and resilience in the face of varied challenges.</p>

<p>Following Eric’s talk, Meghna Chakrabarti, host of NPR’s On Point, moderated a discussion with three Boston leaders: Mohamad Ali, CEO of Carbonite, Yolanda Coentro, CEO of the Institute for Nonprofit Practice, and Karilyn Crockett, lecturer at MIT’s Department of Urban Studies and Planning and former Director of Small Business Development for the City of Boston.</p>

<p>The conversation included reflections on our region’s rich history of aspiration and bold action, and how those ideas are – once again – what we are called to demonstrate today. The video below offers a snapshot of the ground we covered together, and we have also included a link to video of the full event, for those who are interested:</p>

525,Adapting to Climate Change? Here are Three Approaches in Greater Boston,<p>A recent scan of efforts to prepare for climate change surfaces three themes to guide current practices and collaboration in Greater Boston.</p>,"<p>For many Bostonians, summer is the season we look forward to the most. Beach days, lobster rolls, and neighbors gathered outside into the evening to enjoy each other’s company. This summer’s intense heatwaves may have changed some minds. We weren’t the only ones feeling the heat. July 2019 was the Earth’s hottest month—setting a record that has “<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2019/08/05/heres-how-hottest-month-recorded-history-unfolded-around-globe/"">rewritten climate history</a>.”</p>

<p>Extreme heat, along with flooding, severe storms, and extreme cold are just some of the climate impacts that we can expect. As my colleague, Mariella Puerto, wrote last month: <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/no-time-for-complacency"">we are in a climate emergency</a>. In light of this urgent situation, Barr expanded its Climate program to include <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/climate/climate-resilience"">Climate Resilience</a> as a key focus area to support Greater Boston communities as they prepare for and adapt to the impacts of climate change. We recognize that while we must continue to strengthen and expand mitigation activities, we have to face the complex task of preparing for what’s to come.</p>

<p>To better understand current climate resilience work and potential opportunities in the region, we worked with Consensus Building Institute to conduct a <a href=""https://barrfdn.issuelab.org/resource/pathways-to-climate-resilience-strategies-for-the-greater-boston-area.html"">landscape scan</a>. We had several goals for this scan:</p>

<ol>
<li>Identify municipal and regional initiatives focused on climate resilience in the Greater Boston region; and</li>
<li>Inform our grantmaking activities and provide learning opportunities for the field about ongoing and new efforts to protect Greater Boston from the worst climate change impacts.</li>
</ol>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--to""> <p>wanted</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Cities and towns across the state face distinct resilience-related challenges based on their populations, infrastructure, geography, governance, and budgets. The scan highlights nine key approaches that are either already underway or identified as critical to developing resilient communities. As I reviewed the scan, I was struck by three overarching themes that unified the approaches – as well as examples of some of the critical work Barr’s partners are engaged in.</p>
<h3>Building Communities of Climate Champions</h3>
<p>Capacity, resources, and leadership are some of the factors that dictate how well a municipality is able to adapt to and plan for present and future climate impacts. Currently, large gaps in planning and action remain between well-resourced municipalities with dedicated climate staff and those that simply do not have the resources or capacity. Many of the efforts to date have been driven by individual climate champions. However, to create the interventions necessary to protect communities, this work must become the responsibility of a broad set of municipal departments.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.mapc.org/"">Metropolitan Area Planning Council</a> (MAPC), Greater Boston&#39;s regional planning agency, builds the capacity of local communities to both plan for and take action to protect residents and preserve economic and social livability in the face of a changing climate. MAPC works with municipalities to conduct vulnerability assessments that help them to understand the financial and policy implications of resilient solutions. After the assessment is conducted, a broad interdepartmental working group of staff convene to develop a plan to address the challenges that were raised during the assessment. MAPC’s approach allows local leaders to understand the unique challenges that they are facing and work across departments to prioritize action.</p>
<h3>Ensuring Equity is at the Center of Climate Resilience</h3>
<p>Climate change will affect everyone, but not everyone will be impacted equally. Data show that low-income communities and communities of color are already bearing, and will continue to bear a disproportionate burden. Climate resilience efforts have the potential to address long standing social inequities by engaging those who are most impacted as experts and stakeholders.</p>

<p>The scan found that while many municipalities see this as critical work, they lack the tools to start working on solutions. <a href=""http://www.greenrootschelsea.org/"">GreenRoots</a>, an environmental justice group based in Chelsea, is creating examples of community resilience that center around equity and well-being through their microgrid project. GreenRoots is working in partnership with the <a href=""http://greenjusticecoalition.org/"">Green Justice Coalition</a> and <a href=""http://www.greenrootschelsea.org/news/2018/5/29/run-gjc-to-conduct-studies-for-microgrid-projects-in-boston-and-chelsea"">Resilient Urban Neighborhoods</a>. The approach for this microgrid is unique because it starts with community engagement and building local support for the project.</p>
<h3>Collaborating Across Traditional Boundaries</h3>
<p>Climate impacts do not recognize town, county, or state borders. Adequately preparing for climate impacts requires municipalities to address areas of shared vulnerability in addition to their own unique needs. Since this work is so new, decisionmakers will benefit from learning from their neighboring communities. In addition, the scale of the problem is beyond what one single city or town can do and new methods of collaboration are necessary for impact.</p>

<p>Resilient Mystic Collaborative is a new coalition led by <a href=""https://mysticriver.org/"">Mystic River Watershed Association</a> (MyRWA). MyRWA invited municipalities from across the Mystic River Watershed to come together and learn about the vulnerability of critical infrastructure like dams and electric and sewer infrastructure. The coalition will then develop solutions for more resilient infrastructure. These solutions will be responsive to the unique needs of communities, and offer opportunities for collaboration across towns and cities.</p>

<p>In upcoming blogs on climate resilience, MAPC, GreenRoots, and MyRWA will share in more detail how they are carrying out their work and what vision they have for a resilient Greater Boston region.

522,Barr Foundation Extends Commitment to Boston Waterfront,"<p>With opportunity to build on progress and advance an ambitious vision, foundation launches search for full-time director of its waterfront initiative.</p>","<p>Imagine a waterfront that not only protects Boston and its residents but enhances the city. A waterfront with vibrant public parks and family recreation spaces, bold and inspiring design, thriving local businesses and accessible job opportunities. A waterfront all people can enjoy, benefit from, and feel welcome in.</p>

<p>This vision could become Boston’s reality.</p>

<p>Last October, Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh shared the city’s ambitious <em><a href=""https://boston.gov/resilient-harbor"">Resilient Boston Harbor</a></em> plan for the city’s 47 miles of coastline. The plan calls for 67 acres of new open space and adapted infrastructure, both to expand public parks and connections to opportunities along the waterfront, and to protect the city from recurring flooding caused by rising sea levels and storm surge.</p>

<p>Mayor Walsh’s unveiling of <em>Resilient Boston Harbor</em> was an important call to action: public and private investment must come together to support Boston’s viability and well-being today and for generations to come. Success will require active engagement by residents, businesses, nonprofits and philanthropies, and all levels of government.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--unveiling""> <p>Walsh</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>The Barr Foundation is ready to do our part. In spring 2016, the foundation launched <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/special-initiatives/boston-waterfront"">a special initiative</a> to help ensure that all people and neighborhoods of Boston enjoy and benefit from the Boston waterfront, with a focus on public access and climate resilience. To date, Barr has committed <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/grantmaking/grants?query=&program_areas%5B%5D=special_initiatives#Grants"">$13 million</a> in support of <a href=""https://bostonwaterfrontpartners.org"">a range of partners</a> who are developing new public parks, creating wayfinding tools, programming activities at and on the water, advocating for the public’s legal rights to the waterfront, and—importantly—engaging residents to ensure they have a role in deciding their waterfront’s future.</p>

<p>While these investments have been significant and Barr is proud of our partners’ progress on many fronts, now is the time to expand upon these initial commitments. As a first step, Barr is launching a search for a full-time director of the foundation’s waterfront initiative. This work has so far been staffed on a part-time basis by me and colleagues with other responsibilities. We recognize the need now for dedicated staff capacity, commensurate with the level of ambition for the Boston waterfront we share with our partners and as demonstrated by the city’s plans.</p>

<p>Upon this new colleague’s arrival, we will shape further and communicate the next stage of Barr’s waterfront initiative. We know already this must include enhanced collaboration with nonprofit, government, and business partners aligned around shared goals for Boston’s waterfront. We also anticipate that the next phase of Barr’s work will include capital funding, informed by the projects and priorities that emanate from the city’s <em>Resilient Boston Harbor</em> plan.</p>

<p>Protecting Boston from the effects of climate change is vital. But as we consider how the waterfront can help defend us from sea-level rise and storm surge, we would do well to learn from other waterfront cities around the world. Notably, in Copenhagen, the HafenCity district of Hamburg, and Amsterdam, we see the results of a shift in mindset from fighting the water to living with water. These cities and others have realized the co-benefits that can come from approaching the resiliency imperative with vision, boldness, and creativity.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--and""> <p>cities</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>That’s our aspiration for Boston. We are excited to begin this search for a colleague who will lead Barr’s efforts, in partnership with many others, to help realize that aspiration and the great potential Boston’s waterfront holds for all.</p>

521,One Risk That Led to Another,<p>The final installment in a series of seven profiles featuring stories from Greater Boston arts organizations that received special funding to pursue an artistic risk.</p>,"<p><em>The Arts are always about taking risks. But funding for risk-taking is often hard to come by. With new resources dedicated to artistic risk, seven organizations pushed themselves beyond their comfort zones. We asked Peter DuBois, Artistic Director with the Huntington Theater Company, to share their story.</em></p>

<p><div class=""Media -full""> <div class=""u-fluid-iframe""> <div class=""u-fluid-iframe-inner""> <iframe src=""//player.vimeo.com/video/315511665?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0"" title=""Featured Video"" frameborder=""0"" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen loading=""lazy""> <a href=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/315511665?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0"">A video on Vimeo</a> </iframe> </div> </div> </div></p>

<p>Craig Lucas’ play, <em>I Was Most Alive with You</em>, was an exciting experiment for us at the Huntington Theatre. It told the story of a deaf, gay, recovering addict. And, because it included deaf characters, we assigned two actors to each role – one who only used American Sign Language (ASL) and one spoke and signed. The result was an extraordinary and fresh theatrical experience that also stirred in us a desire to work with the deaf community even more deeply.</p>

<p>With an Artistic Risk grant from the Barr-Klarman Arts Capacity Building Initiative, our big idea was to adapt Tennessee Williams’ <em>The Glass Menagerie</em> entirely into ASL, and to present the piece entirely with deaf actors. Rather than have ASL interpreters off to the side of the stage, or even as “shadows” behind speaking actors (as we did with <em>I was Most Alive with You</em>), we envisioned an entirely silent three-hour performance, where members of the deaf community would experience the nuance and emotion of the performance in the same way hearing audiences always have, and hearing audiences would also have a new opportunity to experience the beauty and emotional power of ASL.</p>

<p>As we developed this idea in a workshop with five deaf actors, one of our biggest learnings was that sign language is not a static form. It is informed – much like dialects of spoken languages – by culture, geography, and even personal style of the person doing the signing. Every individual has their own way of expressing concepts and themes. This makes it extremely difficult to express a theatrical script in text, especially one full of nuance and emotion like a Tennessee Williams script.</p>

<p>All of that meant, we couldn’t merely “translate” <em>Glass Menagerie</em> into standard ASL form as we had anticipated. The richness and expressiveness that comes from signing originates with the signer themselves, and not from the standard form. We wouldn’t be able to offer a Huntington Theatre ASL script for other theatres to pick up and use.</p>

<p>At the end of the workshop, we did a full staged reading, completely in ASL. It was incredibly moving to watch, and exciting for us to see audiences – both hearing and deaf – reacting to the potential of this classic work brought to life in a completely new way. You can see a glimpse of that in our video, which ends with an ASL monologue by one of our amazing actors, Amelia Hensley. Yet, that reading was also where our organization hit a stopping point. Considering the challenges and pressures of filling our 375-seat theatre for a five-week run, we decided we weren’t prepared to move forward with a full production.</p>

<p>One thing about risk – success is a possibility, but the only guarantee is the opportunity to learn and grow. Even though we stopped short of a full production, this experience taught us so much more about an audience, and a group of artists we’d never gotten so close to before, and with whom we hope to remain engaged and in conversation.</p>

<h3>About the Barr-Klarman Arts Capacity Building Initiative and this video series:</h3>
<p>The Barr-Klarman Arts Capacity Building Initiative was a five-year initiative to strengthen the long term financial health of a group of Boston area arts organizations. Throughout the Initiative, the partners grappled with the question: capitalization to what end? What’s the desired change for the organization and for our communities? First, the cohort explored what organizational risks could look like, and the kinds of capital needed. And in the last two years, the partners asked what taking risks in the art and curation looked like, and what kinds of support are needed for risk-taking. A fund was set up as part of the Initiative, with the goal of supporting projects that took organizations out of the comfort zone of their usual practice, potentially against standard field practice, and with the potential to change their organizational way of working.</p>

<p>These commissioned videos document the journey of the seven projects that were funded. Each video centers on one organization and, through the eyes of its leaders, gives a glimpse into their journey of artistic risk-taking. We hope that these leaders and projects will engage you in a conversation that deepens understanding and builds support for this exciting kind of work.</p>"
518,It's Time to Transform Transportation in Massachusetts,"<p>At the end of 2018, Massachusetts released a bold vision for the future of transportation in the Commonwealth. To make that vision a reality, it’s our move.</p>","<p>For those of us who know how much better transportation could be in Massachusetts, 2018 was an exciting year. It concluded with the release of recommendations from the Governor’s <a href=""https://www.mass.gov/orgs/commission-on-the-future-of-transportation"">Commission on the Future of Transportation</a>. Drawing on extensive research and listening sessions, the commission offered an ambitious agenda – calling for nothing less than transformation in how people connect to the places they work, study, live, and play in every part of our state. An ambitious vision for transformation is also what Barr’s Mobility Team has set its sights on – a vision that puts people at the center, that improves access to opportunities and quality of life for all, and that helps to address climate change.</p>

<p>I would like to call special attention to three of the many priorities elevated by the commission – <strong>multi-modal transportation options</strong>, including <strong>rail</strong> and <strong>Bus Rapid Transit</strong>. Yet, first, let me offer a few words of encouragement and possibility to check the doubters, cynics, and incrementalists – because it&#39;s time to say, good enough is not good enough.</p>

<p>The people of Massachusetts deserve, and we can create a system that works for all of us – a modern, comfortable, convenient system that meets our needs today. When it’s hard to believe that we are capable of big, bold, change, I find it helpful to reflect on how much the region has actually changed, even in my own lifetime. </p>

<p>Growing up in Jamaica Plain in the 1980s, I remember the unending Big Dig. The (elevated) Orange Line was my gateway to the city. Yet, there were vast swaths of the city my parents forbid me to go, either because they weren’t safe or, because of my Cuban roots, I wouldn’t be welcome. Today, the spectacular Rose Kennedy Greenway links a bustling downtown to the North End and to an entirely new neighborhood in the Seaport. And, Greater Boston is more diverse than ever.</p>

<p>Yet, even as our city has become safer and more livable, deep racial and economic inequalities persist. And climate change is a looming threat to progress on many fronts. We have so much more work to do. Yet, Boston and Massachusetts also have much to be proud of, and a centuries-long track record of sparking revolution, and radical change. We’ve done it before. We have the opportunity again today.</p>

<p>Personally, I let myself envision what the future might hold for my own daughter, who just turned 13. What might we be able to set in motion now, not only for ourselves, but for her generation and beyond?</p>
<h3>Multimodal Options</h3>
<p>We know the future of how we get around the Commonwealth will be defined by a continuing proliferation of new options – what the transportation wonks call “mixed modes.” This is something we’re already seeing among young people who naturally hop between shared app-enabled car trips, bike-share, transit, and more. As the region evolves, we can imagine a mesh of bustling, multimodal routes that allow users to shift from one to the other with minimal friction, using smartphone tools, network-connected vehicles, and common payment methods. We’re also currently supporting the <a href=""https://thesolomonfoundation.org/"">Solomon Foundation’s</a> work on individual greenway projects that, if taken to the next level, would overlay Boston’s neighborhoods with a network of inviting, creatively designed, green pathways for walking and biking.</p>
<h3>Bus Rapid Transit</h3>
<p>The future, as the saying goes, is already here. It’s just not very evenly distributed. In parts of Massachusetts, exciting projects and planning offer glimpses of our future. In the past year, Barr has supported both MassDOT and several cities to begin taking bus service to new levels, with advanced signal technology, dedicated bus lanes, and smoother boarding. These projects are already improving commutes for thousands of people every day. Now, imagine leaping forward to a network of <a href=""http://www.bostonbrt.org/"">Gold Standard Bus Rapid Transit</a> (BRT) lines, transforming our roadways to move hundreds of thousands of riders more efficiently and comfortably. BRT would bring new connections to jobs, schools, and other opportunities for Massachusetts residents. Grab a seat in Mattapan and glide through the city to Harvard Square in half the time, with comfort and dignity. </p>
<h3>Reimagined Commuter Rail</h3>
<p>Even with world-class BRT system, the rail lines we depend on now will always form the backbone of our region’s transportation system. Yet, these lines could do so much more for us than they do today. Imagine, a train network that runs every two or three minutes (instead of 20+, hourly, or worse), serving a much larger ridership, without ever packing people in like sardines. For equitable and sustainable growth, we need to think well beyond Boston. We can reimagine our commuter rail network, and create a web of fast, frequent, reliable, regional rail lines to support densely developed economic hubs all across the state.</p>

<p>This is a lot to imagine. But given the stakes, we’ve got to think big. It’s the only way we will decarbonize our transportation system as quickly as we need to, in order to limit the worst impacts of climate change, and to avoid a future of unsustainable congestion and chronic, debilitating system failures.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--stakes""> <p>the</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>So how do we get there? For one, it will take elected leaders willing to lead, and to make necessary tradeoffs to get the most value for the most people out of our shared spaces, and shared resources – like our roads, bridges, greenways, and rails. We need smart, empowered governance structures. And we need sustainable revenues that reflect what the research tells us again and again – that every dollar invested in transportation is returned many times over in the form expanding opportunities and economic growth. And each bold, new, transformative projects will build confidence and momentum towards that bold vision.</p>

<p>The region has changed so much just in the span of my own lifetime. But there’s no time for standing still. With the right priorities, innovation, and public will, we can once again think big, so that one day, my daughter, her children, and her children’s children will look back at our generation and, as they face their own challenges, will take inspiration from how we seized our moment, and how we made our move.</p>"
517,Massachusetts’ Next Energy Efficiency Plan Could Bring Unprecedented Savings to the Commonwealth,<p>Acadia Center's Senior Attorney shares an assessment of state efforts to create an energy efficiency plan that provides energy savings and benefits for every Massachusetts resident.</p>,"<p>Every three years, Massachusetts refreshes its strategy for improving its energy efficiency programs to benefit people and the planet. The latest three-year plan covers 2019-2021 and includes many positive developments for energy efficiency in the state. Here are some highlights:</p>
<h3>Substantial Savings &amp; Benefits</h3>
<p>The plan will achieve high levels of energy savings and benefits. It proposed statewide electric savings levels of 2.7% of annual sales (enough to power over 583,000 homes through savings). For natural gas, it proposed savings levels of 1.25% of annual sales (enough to heat over 112,000 homes through savings)—the highest natural gas savings goal ever set in Massachusetts, which becomes even more significant when considered year over year. The 2019-2021 Plan will also provide 8.6% higher dollar benefits than the 2016-2018 Plan.</p>
<h3>Significant Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Reductions</h3>
<p>The 2019-2021 Plan is expected to reduce more carbon emissions than ever—2.6 million short tons of CO2 or as much pollution as 500,000 cars on the road.</p>

<p>The plan also increases the significance of greenhouse gas emissions in determining cost-effectiveness for energy efficiency, meaning more reductions will be prioritized going forward. The Massachusetts legislature recently allowed the efficiency plans to integrate renewables and clean energy technologies, bringing the potential for additional GHG reductions.</p>
<h3>New Tools to Reach Underserved Populations</h3>
<p>While Massachusetts’ energy efficiency programs have historically been some of the best in the nation, they have often failed to meet the needs of those people who would most benefit from their services. As our allies, Eugenia Gibbons of Green Energy Consumers’ Alliance and Khalida Smalls of Community Labor United, described in a <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/timely-new-report-shows-substantial-differences-in-energy-savings-among-massachusetts-towns"">blog post</a>, utilities have been unable to show that they are reaching low-to-middle income residents, communities of color, and environmental justice communities at the same rates that they are reaching wealthier communities. There are disparities in access to services that all residents pay for through their electric bills. The 2019-2021 Plan has taken a big step to address this issue, thanks to collaboration among advocates, organizers, and other stakeholders.</p>

<p>For the first time, the plan includes a metric designed to incentivize and track energy efficiency services in these communities, by capturing service to renters. Utilities must collectively serve at least 100,000 rental units over the next three years to receive a corresponding bonus, a portion of $3 million earmarked for this purpose statewide.</p>

<h3>Reducing Cost &amp; Reliance on Fossil Fuels</h3>
<p>Reducing peak electricity demand on the coldest and hottest days can save ratepayers significant amounts of money and avoid running coal and oil power plants that create more pollution. The 2019-2021 Plan introduces the programs’ first full-scale active demand management offering, including a small winter program for natural gas. The electric demand program also includes additional incentives for storage technologies and permanent demand reduction targets of 665 MW in the summer and 500 MW in the winter.</p>
<h3>New Incentives for Modern Heating Solutions</h3>
<p>This three-year plan will include new educational and incentive programs for homes with all kinds of heating. This expansion will improve access to weatherization, air sealing, and high efficiency equipment for customers who choose efficient electric heat pumps. It will also increase the number of heat pumps operating in the state, thanks to targets for 62,000 new installations and incentives to switch to clean heating, particularly from oil and propane. Furthermore, a new program will enable more passive house construction, which will overwhelmingly utilize heat pumps as well.</p>
<h3>Process and Next Steps</h3>
<p>In October, the <a href=""http://ma-eeac.org/about/"">Energy Efficiency Advisory Council</a> (EEAC), which oversees the development of the three-year plans, unanimously approved a resolution supporting the plan. As the environmental representative on the EEAC, Acadia Center led the charge to improve this plan from original proposals, with many stakeholders contributing their voices and priorities.</p>

<p>The Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (DPU) will issue its decision on the plan at the end of January. Once finalized, the plan will be administered by utilities through Mass Save programs. Acadia Center urges that the DPU pass the plan to lock in the benefits mentioned above.</p>
<h3>Final Recommendations for the DPU’s Decision</h3>
<p>Even with these positive developments, there are several opportunities that remain unaddressed in the plan. The DPU could remedy these issues in the final decision, and Acadia Center urges them to do so.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Utilities should strive to achieve more uniform goals and savings.</strong> Every customer in Massachusetts should have access to the same energy efficiency opportunities at comparable costs—but some utilities serve half the proportion of residents for double the cost, meaning that where customers live could dictate the access to or depth of efficiency services available.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The DPU must lay out a specific process and standards to govern formal studies on potential efficiency savings.</strong> Otherwise, it is very difficult to compare them, verify that they are accurate, or aggregate them into a statewide goal.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Finally, the DPU should require the plan to increase transparency of Mass Save’s data and create a common data platform across utilities.</strong> Access to data will improve accountability, customer service, and engagement.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>With this decision, Massachusetts can solidify its leadership on energy efficiency by tackling some of the most persistent barriers to further improvement. Energy efficiency is the lowest cost energy resource available. It lowers energy bills while contributing to a stronger economy and healthier future, and everyone deserves access to these benefits.</p>"
516,A People’s Guide for the People’s Harbor,<p>Victoria Wu shares a new guide from Conservation Law Foundation  to help visitors and residents understand and advocate for their rights on the Boston Harbor waterfront.</p>,"<p>Boston Harbor is your waterfront. Massachusetts state law gives you the right to access and enjoy the harbor and other waterfront areas in the state. But these legal protections are full of complex regulations, and some developers have made it look like their public land is only for private use.</p>

<p>To help you navigate it all, CLF has put together the <a href=""https://www.clf.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/CLF-Peoples-Guide-Public-Waterfront-Act-Dec18.pdf"">People’s Guide to the Public Waterfront Act</a>. This law, also known as “Chapter 91,” spells out your rights to access waterfront areas in Massachusetts and the steps developers must take to respect them. This guide makes it easy to understand this important law, your rights under it, and how you can get involved to ensure that Boston Harbor remains the People’s Harbor.</p>
<h3>Public Access to the Harbor and Other Waterfront Areas is Your Legal Right</h3>
<p>The Boston Harbor waterfront wasn’t always a desirable place to live, work, and play. In the 1980s, it was one of the dirtiest bodies of water in the country. But thanks to <a href=""https://www.clf.org/making-an-impact/boston-harbor/"">CLF’s work to hold polluters accountable</a>, Boston Harbor is now a beautiful, vibrant place. Today, everyone should be able to enjoy the waterfront, but too often, private developers are roping off public spaces, both literally and metaphorically.</p>

<p>Did you know that you don’t need to order food to sit on the lawn at the Intercontinental Hotel and enjoy the Harbor views, even though the hotel makes it appear that you do? Or that you have every right to walk along the Harborwalk, even if areas are roped off for a “private” event?</p>

<p>Cleaning up Boston Harbor took more than 30 years and billions of dollars of public investment. Now, some powerful developers are reaping millions in profits from this public investment, essentially privatizing the waterfront in the process and making the rest of us feel or think we are unwelcome in public spaces.</p>

<p>But CLF is fighting for public access on Boston Harbor and other waterfront areas in Massachusetts. <a href=""https://www.clf.org/blog/everett-gateway-center-fails-the-public-violates-state-law/"">Everett’s Gateway Center</a> avoided its legal obligation to provide public access to the Mystic River waterfront for 20 years. <a href=""https://www.clf.org/blog/update-good-news-for-public-waterfront-access-in-everett/"">CLF recently spurred</a> the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection to require the center to make good on its promise to build a bike path and provide amenities for the Everett community.</p>

<p>Whether it’s new development or existing buildings, public access rights are at risk when properties put up signs claiming a lawn is private, lock public bathrooms, or ask you to leave a public space.</p>

<p>You can help in the fight for our public waterfront spaces by understanding your rights and when and how to get involved in protecting them.</p>

<h3>Our Rights and How to Fight for Them</h3>
<p>CLF’s <a href=""https://www.clf.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/CLF-Peoples-Guide-Public-Waterfront-Act-Dec18.pdf"">People’s Guide to the Public Waterfront Act</a> is a step toward reclaiming our waterfront rights. The more informed the public is, the more often we can take action when our rights are violated. To help simplify the learning process, the guide includes a Public Waterfront Act Bill of Rights, which compiles scattered mentions of rights from government documents into an easy-to-read list with helpful examples. The guide also explains what to do if these rights are violated.</p>

<p>Some highlights from the Public Waterfront Act Bill of Rights:</p>

<ol>
<li>You have the right to be provided with free and unencumbered access to public facilities and open spaces on the waterfront.</li>
<li>You have the right to well-maintained and programmed public areas.</li>
<li>You have the right to meaningful participation in all Public Waterfront Act public hearings and comment processes.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Go Out and Enjoy the Waterfront</h3>
<p>The Boston Harbor is <a href=""https://www.bostonharborwalk.org/"">full of public amenities</a>, from bike racks to kayak launches to public bathrooms. Our waterfront belongs to us all to use and enjoy. Let’s keep it that way.</p>

515,"The Why, What, and How of a High School Portrait of a Graduate","<p>Explore key insights and a recording from a webinar led by a recent college graduate of an innovative school, a local educator, and leaders of national nonprofits.</p>","<p>The Barr Foundation recently hosted a webinar on the topic of a portrait of a graduate because it is an essential tool in high school design efforts. We know that too many students graduate from high schools without being prepared for life after high school. Our high school design partners are developing a local portrait of a graduate that provides a collective vision and articulates the community’s aspirations for all students. I have observed how the process of creating this portrait garners deep stakeholder buy-in and serves as the foundation for teams to think more boldly about the possibilities for their high school design.</p>

<p>Our webinar featured local stories from Jalen Epps, recent graduate of <a href=""https://duet.org/"">Duet</a> and Matt Brunell, Co-Executive Director of the <a href=""http://www.springfieldempowerment.org/"">Springfield Empowerment Zone</a> and national perspectives from Andy Calkins, Director of <a href=""https://www.nextgenlearning.org/"">Next Generation Learning Challenges</a> and Cynthia Leck, Partner at <a href=""http://www.transcendeducation.org/"">Transcend</a>.</p>

<h3>Why do high schools need to establish a portrait of a graduate?</h3>
<p>In order for all students to reach their potential, high schools must be intentionally designed to hold all students to high expectations. Through the development and use of a portrait of a graduate, high schools can embrace an expanded definition of student success, one that ensures that students are fully equipped with core academic knowledge and skills, as well as a range of other competencies that we all need to be successful in education, work, and life. Jalen Epps described how he struggled with time management skills when he first entered college and that postsecondary opportunities provided him the communication and soft skills that he needed to be successful.</p>

<p>While pockets of innovation exist across the nation and here in New England, the prevailing structure of high schools is ill-equipped to address the learning needs and challenges of current and future students. Matt Brunell shared that he is animated by the question of “how do we help others feel and live their worth?” The portrait of a graduate developed through the redesign process for the High School of Commerce is being used to drive the educational model and how the school is measuring student success.</p>
<h3>What is a portrait of a graduate?</h3>

<p>A portrait of a graduate can serve as a north star to drive transformation of traditional school models. Developing a portrait of a graduate pushes educators to articulate the full range of outcomes they want for their graduates, and work backwards from there to build a school model in which each element maps directly to the identified outcomes. </p>

<p>Next Generation Learning Challenges (NGLC) developed the <a href=""https://myways.nextgenlearning.org/"">MyWays Student Success Framework</a>, a synthesis of 20 competencies for success in learning, work, and life. MyWays articulates four areas of competency: content knowledge, habits of success, creative know how, and wayfinding abilities. Andy Calkins described that the MyWays Framework provides a holistic view of what all students need in the 21st Century and is a resource for communities to consider the range of competencies that could be in their local portrait of a graduate.</p>
<h3>How does a community develop a portrait of a graduate and drive school change?</h3>
<p>When done well, a portrait of a graduate should be developed through a local, robust process that engages multiple stakeholders. As Matt Brunell shared, “the process of building a graduate profile is as much about the engagement of school stakeholders as it is about the substance of the final product.” Cynthia Leck described Transcend’s emphasis on developing a “graduate aims” (graduate portrait) through community activities to understand the local context, future trends, and learning and development. Several of our presenters mentioned that activities such as student interviews, surveys, and community gatherings are important to deeply root a graduate profile in the local context, values, and needs.</p>

<p>Transcend created the <a href=""http://www.transcendeducation.org/defining-graduate-aims"">Defining Graduate Aims Paper</a> and the <a href=""http://www.transcendeducation.org/grad-aims-database"">Graduate Aims Database</a> to provide teams practical resources and tools to develop their local portrait of a graduate, and then use that portrait to design the learning environment and assess student progress.</p>

514,An Artist Walks into a Planning Agency,<p>Reflections from the Metropolitan Area Planning Council's first Artist-in-Residence at the conclusion of her 18-month residency.</p>,"<p><em>Last year, with funding from the Barr Foundation, the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC), Greater Boston&#39;s regional planning agency, hired <a href=""https://carolynl.net"">Carolyn Lewenberg</a> as its first artist-in-residence. The goal of the MAPC Artist-in-Residence Program is to bring arts, culture, and creativity into the agency’s multidisciplinary planning work with cities, towns, and other organizations. By tapping the talents and perspectives of a visiting artist, the residency aims to infuse arts, culture, and creativity into project scoping and implementation while enriching and expanding the creative practice of the visiting artist. This post is excerpted and adapted from a longer version (which also features images and descriptions of Carolyn’s projects) <a href=""https://www.mapc.org/planning101/a-reflection-from-mapcs-first-artist-in-residence/"">published by MAPC</a>.</em></p>

<p>The end of my residency has prompted a lot of reflection on where I am now versus where I was when it began, 18 months ago, and how this experience has shaped my practice as a public artist. Prior to my work at MAPC, my bread and butter was working as an educator and youth worker while making studio art and public art projects on the side, attempting as often as I could to integrate this into my work with young people. Having the last 18 months to work solely on public art projects has been an enormous privilege, and I’m excited to leap out of the nest of MAPC into freelancing with some fresh new skills and approaches.</p>

<p>Over the last 18 months, I’ve worked with 10 different planners at the agency (in a variety of departments - from Land Use, Public Health, Environment, Government Affairs, and Strategic Initiatives). I was also involved in project development conversations with Municipal Collaboration, Transportation, Clean Energy, and Data Services. To see images and read descriptions of all the projects I worked on, visit <a href=""https://www.mapc.org/planning101/a-reflection-from-mapcs-first-artist-in-residence/"">my reflection for MAPC</a>.</p>

<p>It was an honor to work on these dynamic projects with such highly motivated, passionate, and gifted individuals as the first Artist-in-Residence at MAPC. Many of these projects grew out of the conversations I had in the first couple months of my residency when I met with directors from all the dynamic practice areas at MAPC about how they imagined arts and culture could be woven into their work. I was inspired by the depth and breadth of their focus areas, and excited about the different possibilities of how we could collaborate. The opportunity not only to imagine possibilities together but to put the ideas into action was very special.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--inspired""> <p>was</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Prior to this experience, I hadn’t really considered how different it would be to practice out of a government planning agency instead of a studio environment, as studio space was not a resource that MAPC offered. Instead of my studio-based practice of playing with materials, exploring a site, having conversations with people who have personal connections with a place and allowing an inclusive process to emerge, at MAPC the experimentation and play happened through collaborative conversations with planners whose perspectives were supported by research and data. Once the general vision for the project was articulated, I would then connect with the community. The artistic process was highly structured in advance of community engagement. I struggled to navigate this process in a way that would allow for flexibility once community engagement began. Throughout, I learned what community members and resources would support the work and offer new directions that made sense for the process, product, and site.</p>

<p>The most challenging aspect of adjusting to working at a planning agency was accounting for time in an hourly way and figuring out what code to bill it to, and working primarily in an office environment. Adjusting to the workplace culture at MAPC called for a very different process that naturally called for more planning, which stretched my abilities and allowed for great professional development. Instead of the work emerging from an organic artmaking process over time, within a budget, approval to go ahead on projects required detailed plans for implementation, and how much time it would likely take to produce the work. I realized that this approach positioned me to hand off the fabrication to another person, which expanded my capacity to take on more projects. I learned project management skills that I will carry forward.</p>

<h3>What&#39;s Next?</h3>
<p>As I peer over the nest of MAPC and think about the direction and style of my flight, I’d like to thank of all the people at MAPC who offered their collaborative spirit and strengthened my practice. I also think about so many people outside MAPC I had the privilege to work with: I think of the teens in Everett with neon orange shirts applying polyurethane to the waterdrop sculpture, people sharing their collages at creative placemaking workshops, and guests from Providence talking about public health at the discussion series. I’ve gotten to meet so many community members, leaders, and youth who shape our region. It’s been such a rich residency, and I am grateful for this experience.</p>

<p>My creative direction will include more Creative Placemaking projects, Green Infrastructure projects, and Spirit of Place commissions. Specific upcoming projects include:</p>

<li>Organizing the Boston Harbor [Re]creation Artist in Residency program. For more info visit <a href=""https://www.bostonharbornow.org/recreation/"">Boston Harbor Now&#39;s website</a>.</li>
<li>Contracting with MAPC on future projects. These include:

480,New Photo-Essay Explores Boston Waterfront,"<p>Through photography, artist Leonardo March captures the human experience on Boston’s waterfront.</p>","<p>For the past several years, Barr and a range of <a href=""https://bostonwaterfrontpartners.org/"">partners</a> have worked together to ensure that all people can both access and benefit from Boston’s waterfront, one of our greatest public resources. In doing this work, we can be easily caught up in debates about zoning codes, regulatory frameworks, and legal considerations and risk losing sight of arguably the most important factor at play: the human experience. To identify the solutions that will make a difference in people’s lives, we need to be close enough to understand what people want and need from their waterfront.</p>

<p>That’s why Barr commissioned artist Leonardo March to explore the Boston Harbor waterfront this past summer—through his camera lens. Leo’s new photo-essay, <a href=""https://bostonwaterfrontpartners.org/essay/another-room-in-the-house/""><em>Another Room in the House</em></a>, does what art can do so powerfully: confront reality, pose difficult questions, and inspire new ideas.</p>

<p>Leo, who <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/partners/boston-creates-artist-ethnographer-leonardo-march"">was an artist-ethnographer</a> for <em>Boston Creates</em>, surveyed the many places and ways Boston residents and visitors interact (or don’t) with the waterfront today, from Dorchester to East Boston and in between. <em>Another Room in the House</em> shows us how widely experiences range and compels us to consider who feels welcome and who does not. It also reminds us that we can change this for the better, ending with an observation by architect Léon Krier that, “A city is not an accident but the result of coherent visions and aims,” which Leo found inscribed in LoPresti Park in East Boston.</p>

478,A Risk that Expanded the Boundaries of Excellence,<p>Sixth in a new series featuring stories from Greater Boston arts organizations that received special funding to pursue an artistic risk.</p>,"<p><em>The Arts are always about taking risks. But funding for risk-taking is often hard to come by. With new resources dedicated to artistic risk, seven organizations pushed themselves beyond their comfort zones. This story of what happened comes from World Music/CRASHarts Executive Director Maure Aronson.</em></p>

<p><div class=""Media -full""> <div class=""u-fluid-iframe""> <div class=""u-fluid-iframe-inner""> <iframe src=""//player.vimeo.com/video/311528405?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0"" title=""Featured Video"" frameborder=""0"" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen loading=""lazy""> <a href=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/311528405?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0"">A video on Vimeo</a> </iframe> </div> </div> </div></p>

<p>With an artistic risk grant from Barr and The Klarman Family Foundation, World Music/CRASHarts did something we’d never done before – we commissioned a new work of art. The experience was both thrilling and terrifying for us as an organization. And, it changed us in fundamental ways.</p>

<p>Traditionally, World Music/CRASHarts has been a presenter of work developed elsewhere. We have brought music and dance productions from around the world to Boston. This has given us a measure of control. It has always been important to us that, when people see our name at the bottom of a program, they expect an experience of excellence.</p>

<p>Yet, with the support of the artistic risk grant, we ceded that control. We commissioned Alonzo King of <a href=""https://linesballet.org/"">LINES Ballet</a> in San Francisco, and <a href=""http://www.zakirhussain.com/"">Zakir Hussain</a>, a tabla virtuoso percussionist, to collaborate on an original dance and musical performance. The artistic direction was entirely theirs.</p>

<p>This kind of collaboration was entirely new to us. In early 2017, we found ourselves balancing the demanding schedules of these accomplished artists, seeking a venue that would showcase their collaboration – which we expected and hoped would be brilliant, even though we didn’t know exactly what it was we would soon need to start marketing.</p>

<p>When I first approached our Board President, Nagesh Mahanthappa, about the potential of becoming a commissioning organization, we knew that taking this risk had the potential to fundamentally change the organization. I am so grateful that Nagesh, and our entire board of directors were willing to venture into these uncertain waters with us. They shared in our angst and wonder as it developed. And they shared in our abundant joy when the production debuted to audience and critical acclaim. In the end, we were indeed honored to have our name attached to this brilliant performance, which will be seen all over the world.</p>

<p>This risk changed us. Resolved that this not be a one-time experience, our board adopted an annual budget line for original commissions. It is now a priority for our organization that we continue to take risks like this, and to continue growing alongside our artists – as they likewise embrace risk, change, and growth.</p>

<h4>About the Barr-Klarman Arts Capacity Building Initiative and this video series:</h4>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/arts-creativity/artistic-risk"">Barr-Klarman Arts Capacity Building Initiative</a> was a five-year initiative to strengthen the long term financial health of a group of Boston area arts organizations. Throughout the Initiative, the partners grappled with the question: capitalization to what end? What’s the desired change for the organization and for our communities? First, the cohort explored what organizational risks could look like, and the kinds of capital needed. And in the last two years, the partners asked what taking risks in the art and curation looked like, and what kinds of support are needed for risk-taking. A fund was set up as part of the Initiative, with the goal of supporting projects that took organizations out of the comfort zone of their usual practice, potentially against standard field practice, and with the potential to change their organizational way of working.
These commissioned videos document the journey of the seven projects that were funded. Each centers on one organization and, through the eyes of its leaders, gives a glimpse into one journey of artistic risk-taking. We hope that these leaders and projects will engage you a conversation that deepens understanding and builds support for this exciting kind of work.</p>"
477,"""#1 For Some"" Is Not Good Enough","<p>Recent reports fuel efforts to link all students in Massachusetts to success in college, career, and life.</p>","<p>This post features the critical questions, key findings, and links to five reports Barr helped to fund over the last year as part of the Education Program’s <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/education-program-strategies"">Build Public Will strategy</a>. We strongly believe that good decisions on what should come next in education need to be informed by a credible and reliable fact base - an honest look at what is currently happening. In the Build Public Will strategy, we strive to increase access for all parents, students, educators, civic leaders, and residents to high-quality information on what is happening in our schools and with our students, as well as what is possible for our young people.</p>

<p><strong>In Massachusetts, the education success story is not true for all students.</strong> In the report <a href=""https://number1forsome.org/"">“#1 for Some”</a>, The Education Trust and the Massachusetts Education Equity Partnership outline that the narrative of Massachusetts’ educational success story is far from accurate. Massachusetts 8th grade students were indeed first in the country in Math NAEP results, but Latino 8th grade students were 43rd and Black 8th grade students were 47th.  The ramifications of the inequitable educational opportunities provided to our young people show up not just in 8th grade math, but in student outcomes across the preschool to higher education to workforce spectrum.</p>

<p>#1 for some is not good enough. The Barr Foundation’s Education Program is based on the belief that <strong>all students</strong> have the potential to succeed after high school in college, work, and life.</p>
<h3>Where are we relative to the goal of preparing all students for success after high school?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>18% of BPS high school students are off-track to graduate.</strong> We know from the recent <a href=""https://www.parthenon.ey.com/po/en/perspectives/excellence-and-equity-for-all--unlocking-opportunities-for-off-track-youth-in-boston-public-schools"">EY-Parthenon report</a>, that there is a range of quality in Boston Public Schools high schools, and where a student goes to school matters a lot for his or her outcomes. One student’s odds of graduating can range 30% depending on which high school he or she attends, and there is inequitable access (across race and other demographics) to the schools where the odds of graduating are high.</li>
<li><strong>48% of students who do graduate high school are not prepared for what is next.</strong> The recent <a href=""http://www.successboston.org/videos/2018/apr/staying-the-course-sb"">Success Boston</a> report identifies that nearly half of BPS high school graduates who go on to a post-secondary program immediately upon graduation actually graduate within 6 years. Here too, there are racial inequities amongst those who arrive prepared to succeed and those who do not.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What’s getting in the way of success for all students?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The classroom experience is not rigorous and engaging enough.</strong> <a href=""https://tntp.org/publications/view/student-experiences/the-opportunity-myth"">TNTP’s The Opportunity Myth</a> outlined that teachers’ expectations of what students can achieve is not, on the whole, aligned with grade-level standards. Therefore, it is not surprising that in this study, students only received appropriately rigorous instruction ~20% of the time. The large majority of students were succeeding on their assignments, but those assignments did not give the students the opportunity to reach for grade-level proficiency. High schoolers reported that their school experiences were engaging only 42% of the time. And, once again, the inequitable access to quality (and high expectations) is evident.</li>
<li><strong>Parents are eager to help, but do not have an accurate picture of students’ preparedness.</strong> <a href=""https://bealearninghero.org/maparents/"">Learning Heroes’</a> recent parent research explains that Massachusetts parents base their perceptions of student achievement more on student report cards and teacher feedback than on the state test. Clearly there is a disconnect if 88% of parents think their students are at or above grade-level, when only ~50% actually are. Parents believe they are largely responsible for their students’ success and are hungry for ways to be more engaged in their students’ learning.</li>
</ul>

<p>The challenges outlined by these reports may be significant, and perhaps not surprising to some, but the responsibility to act is clear. The questions are: What is next? Who is deciding what comes next? And, how are those decisions being made? We look forward to continuing to support a diverse set of stakeholders to come together as a community to reflect on this information and develop the next generation of high school models for our students and the supporting solutions to make those possible.</p>"
476,States Competing to Lead in Offshore Wind,"<p>Catherine Bowes of the National Wildlife Federation on why offshore wind is taking off across the US, and what’s ahead for this game-changing source of clean, renewable energy.</p>","<p>America’s offshore wind story is an exciting and inspiring one, as nearly every week brings new announcements of bold steps forward by political and industry leaders. The momentum offers a beacon of hope as sobering reminders of the need to protect our communities and wildlife from climate change continue to increase.</p>

<p>After decades of lagging behind Europe, where the first offshore wind turbines were installed over 25 years ago, what’s different about this moment in America’s offshore wind story, and why is it so promising? Three main drivers are helping to propel offshore wind forward:</p>
<h4>Proven Technology:</h4>
<ul>
<li>America’s first 5 offshore wind turbines have been online since 2016 off the coast of Rhode Island, reliably producing enough power for 17,000 homes, showing that projects can be built with protections for wildlife and strong community support. There are now over 4,000 turbines installed in waters around the world, demonstrating the many environmental and economic benefits of offshore wind.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Increasingly Affordable:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The perceived high cost relative to other energy choices has been one of the biggest obstacles to offshore wind in the U.S.. This shifted dramatically when a record-low <a href=""https://commonwealthmagazine.org/energy/offshore-wind-prices-look-competitive/"">price was revealed</a> for Vineyard Wind, America’s first commercial scale project. At a cost significantly lower than even the most optimistic observers had predicted, this project will reduce electric rates in the Commonwealth and provide a buffer for ratepayers against volatile fossil fuel costs. This “shot heard round the world” has validated what the trends in Europe suggest, that long-term, large scale commitments can deliver economies of scale and bring costs down, positioning offshore wind to compete in today’s energy markets.</li>
</ul>
<h4>States are Mobilizing:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The race is on to lead on offshore wind. States along the east coast are competing to become a hub for this new industry, accelerating investments in port and workforce development. While New Jersey has vaulted to the front of the pack with the largest goal and most aggressive timeline, <a href=""https://offshorewind.nwf.org/massachusetts-clean-energy-bill-clears-the-way-for-more-offshore-wind-power/"">Massachusetts</a>, <a href=""https://offshorewind.nwf.org/news-governor-cuomo-issues-new-yorks-large-scale-offshore-wind-solicitation/"">New York</a>, <a href=""https://www.ri.gov/press/view/33287"">Rhode Island</a>, <a href=""https://offshorewind.nwf.org/offshore-wind-takes-major-step-forward-in-connecticut/"">Connecticut</a>, and even <a href=""https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2018/august/headline-828314-en.html"">Virginia</a> are all actively mobilizing to land the many economic and environmental benefits offshore wind power can deliver.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just this fall, we have seen major progress as the industry comes to life on the east coast. At the Global Climate Action Summit in California, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy made offshore wind as a critical component of his strategy to confront climate change and position New Jersey as a leader in building a clean energy economy. Governor Murphy signed the nation’s largest offshore wind goal of 3,500 megawatts (MW) into law and announced the most aggressive offshore wind procurement schedule for any state, inviting bids for the first 1,100 MW by the end of this year.</p>

<p>New York Governor Cuomo has made clear that New York intends to keep the pace on its offshore wind program with the recent release of a Request for Proposals (RFP) for at least 800 MW. The RFP includes precedent-setting provisions to ensure that projects maximize local economic benefits – including requiring all bidders to pay workers prevailing wages and commit to labor agreements – as well as environmental protections at all stages of development. And last week, the Long Island Power Authority increased the size of its first contract, allowing LIPA to buy more offshore wind for a lower price.</p>

<p>In Massachusetts, Governor Charlie Baker recently joined local business, government and community leaders in New Bedford to <a href=""https://www.masscec.com/about-masscec/news/baker-polito-administration-vineyard-wind-announce-agreement-new-bedford-marine"">celebrate a final agreement with Vineyard Wind</a> to utilize the port facility in New Bedford for construction activities. The Governor proudly pointed to this first lease for the state-owned Marine Commerce Terminal as “the beginning of the story,” and that “Massachusetts’ workers and the South Coast will help lead this new frontier for American energy and establish a hub for offshore wind development on the East Coast.” Also along the South Coast sits the former Brayton Point Power Station, a site that <a href=""http://www.southcoasttoday.com/news/20181108/owners-rebrand-brayton-point-with-offshore-wind-in-mind"">in the process of being redeveloped</a> and rebranded to serve the offshore wind industry, a tangible example of the role that offshore wind is playing in the transformation of New England’s energy system.</p>

<p>All of this news comes just weeks after <a href=""https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/trump-administration-delivers-historic-progress-offshore-wind"">major offshore wind announcements</a> from the US Department of the Interior, including a date for the much-anticipated federal auction for three new lease areas off the coast of Massachusetts. As states continue to set higher offshore wind goals, and more industry players enter this competitive marketplace, the availability of new leases is a critical piece of the puzzle. America’s offshore wind industry is on track for massive growth, with east coast states now committed to over 8,500 MW of offshore wind power - enough to power nearly 4 million homes.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--wind""> <p>offshore</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>National Wildlife Federation is thrilled to see this momentum in America’s pursuit of responsibly developed offshore wind power. We stand with a broad and diverse alliance of conservation, labor, business, faith, environmental justice, and community partners working to make it happen. With the urgency of climate change looming and already bringing devastating impacts to wildlife and communities here and around the globe, we must seize this opportunity available off our shores.</p>

<p>While this exciting progress is in many ways long overdue, it is also important to note that the offshore wind goals set by these states are just that – goals. We must now pivot to ensuring that only projects that maximize environmental protection, local workforce opportunities, and other community benefits are selected by states to meet their goals. There are also a number of issues that transcend individual states and projects and will require further attention as this industry matures, including transmission planning, port infrastructure investments, supply chain and workforce development, concerns about potential conflicts with commercial fishing and other offshore navigation issues – among others.</p>

<p>Addressing these issues requires an inclusive, strategic approach with leadership from government, industry, environmental groups, labor, coastal communities, and other stakeholders. Together, we are writing an exciting and essential new chapter in America’s energy story.</p>"
474,Barr Announces RFP for Cohort Three of the Engage New England Initiative ,"<p>Seeking proposals for $150,000, one-year planning grants from teams ready to do high school differently.</p>","<p>We are excited to announce a <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/partners/rfp"">request for proposals</a> (RFP) to identify the third and final cohort of teams that will join the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/education/engage-new-england"">Engage New England: Doing High School Differently</a> initiative. The Barr Foundation seeks proposals from partners interested in developing quality, innovative public high schools and programs across New England designed to support students toward a path to post-secondary success. School models will be rooted in <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/what-is-positive-youth-development-in-high-schools"">positive youth development theory</a> that engages students through their interests and empowers them with the knowledge and skills to succeed in college, career, and community. Selected teams will embark upon a deep planning and design phase to develop a school model that deliberatively and comprehensively supports students who are not on track to graduate.</p>

<p>In 2016 Barr announced the multi-year Engage New England initiative, which is part of the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/education-program-strategies"">Education Program’s strategy</a> to catalyze new high school models across the region. Through Engage New England, our goal is to marshal critical resources, awareness, and opportunities to support one of New England’s most marginalized high school populations: students who are off track to graduate from high school—and therefore have  limited opportunities to connect to post-secondary success.</p>

<p>Our goal is to support the development of exemplary schools and programs across the region that can powerfully demonstrate the impact of intentionally addressing both academic and developmental needs with student-centered, rigorous, and supportive approaches. We believe that all students can meet high expectations when they have a choice to learn in a school that meets their interests, empowers their potential in a caring and creative environment, and fully prepares them for success in life.</p>

<p>The teams selected through this RFP will join the first and second cohorts of the Engage New England initiative, which were announced in <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/barr-announces-first-cohort-of-partners-in-30-million-engage-new-england-doing-high-school-differently-initiative"">June 2017</a> and <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/announcing-new-partners-doing-high-school-differently"">June 2018</a>, respectively. Engage New England participants connect within and across cohorts, and are partners in an innovation collaborative—learning from each other and like-minded innovators across the nation, while receiving robust technical assistance from design and planning through implementation. Together they will build a diverse set of school models that transform high school learning experiences for young people whose prior experiences have failed to engage them and empower their success.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--will""> <p>teams</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>This RFP addresses the first phase of potential funding for Cohort 3 teams, which is for planning. Starting today, applicants can begin preparing their proposals for one-year planning phase grants of up to $150,000 each to support the development of their school or program. A webinar for prospective applicants will be held on November 29th, and additional opportunities to learn about the initiative and ask questions will be available during <a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdFralTIDLW-TGs3njMEDRz3G4U9VZfVVCZSo75LR1ritORpQ/viewform"">“office hours”</a> via conference calls on November 30, December 13 and 17, and January 11 and 14. Barr will accept proposals via an online form until February 1, 2019.</p>

<p>We expect to announce the new cohort of up to eight planning teams in July 2019. In addition to financial support, each awardee will receive technical assistance and collective learning opportunities facilitated by our nonprofit partner <a href=""https://www.springpointschools.org/"">Springpoint</a>. Springpoint is a national nonprofit organization that supports the design and launch of innovative public high schools, and they have curated a set of <a href=""https://www.springpointschools.org/School-Design-Resources/"">school design resources</a> to support applicants of the Engage New England initiative.</p>

<p>Planning grant awardees that are successful in their planning and design efforts will be invited to apply for grants of up to $750,000 for up to three years of implementation. We anticipate that successful applicants in the implementation phase will then launch their models in the fall of 2020.</p>

<p>We believe that all students have the right and the ability to connect to secondary and post-secondary success. In order to fully realize their potential, all students—even those who are not currently on track to graduate—can and must be supported to achieve at high levels. Doing so requires targeted investments in new models that embrace a student-centered approach.

473,Nine Questions with Barr's New Climate Resilience Program Officer,<p>A conversation with Kalila Barnett about Barr’s new climate focus area and opportunities in Greater Boston.</p>,"<h4>What drew you to this opportunity at Barr?</h4>
<p>With this position, I saw an opportunity to explore the ways that climate change impacts people, and to ensure that climate resilience efforts improve quality of life for all communities.</p>
<h4>Is there an experience that underscored for you the urgency to prepare for the impacts of climate change?</h4>
<p>Boston’s winter of 2015 was a big moment. The city was overwhelmed. I could not drive for two months because of the conditions, and the MBTA shut down for a period of time. These extreme storms will continue to happen. The resilience work ahead of us will expose infrastructure gaps and areas where communities require better support and coordination. At the same time, this opens up space to talk about climate change in practical ways that can create the political will for the kind of transformation that is needed.</p>
<h4>Why is it important that Boston and this region pay attention to climate resilience?</h4>
<p>All of the social inequities that play out in our daily lives are going to be made worse by climate change. Communities that are already struggling with housing issues, health care, inadequate transportation, and access to food, will be the most vulnerable. How do we seize intervention opportunities to address not only environmental problems but also societal issues? Paying attention to resilience engages people in a way that a traditional environmental frame might not.</p>
<h4>At Alternatives for Community and Environment (ACE), you worked closely with people throughout greater Boston on climate resilience and environmental issues. Tell us more about your experience and what you learned.</h4>
<p>At ACE, we worked to reclaim the word environment so that it encompassed things that people are experiencing. We framed environmental issues in terms of human impact, the built environment, and more recently around climate justice. Sometimes we took on issues that fell out of the mainstream understanding of environment but were essential to our communities, like gentrification or lack of quality jobs for youth in Boston. One of the key lessons I learned was that just policies should center around and be created by those who will be most impacted.</p>
<h4>How do you think philanthropy can be most constructive as a partner in this work?</h4>
<p>I think philanthropy can help focus what is most important. Sometimes, conversations about resiliency can get separated from real people and focus too much on infrastructure or technology. Philanthropy has the flexibility to support experimentation that municipal governments might not. We can support ideas that have the potential to be scaled up. There’s a lot we’re still learning.</p>
<h4>You&#39;ve been working in Boston&#39;s nonprofit sector for over a decade. How would you describe the sector here? What are unique assets or strengths?</h4>
<p>I&#39;ve had the privilege of working with many individuals and organizations doing important nonprofit work for a long time. There&#39;s a high level of commitment to community voice and decision making. We are lucky to have organizations working at multiple scales—community-based, intermediaries, and larger nonprofits that work city-or region-wide. In the cases where you can get the nonprofit community united around an issue like ensuring that the city is resilient in a way that benefits all people, we can make positive change.</p>
<h4>What&#39;s been the most surprising thing you&#39;ve encountered at Barr in your new role?</h4>
<p>I&#39;ve been pleasantly surprised by the level of humility and collaboration that my colleagues bring to their work. There&#39;s a level of trust with our partners that is exciting. At Barr, I&#39;ve found that there is an understanding about the kind of time that it takes to move the needle and a desire to build long-term relationships.</p>
<h4>Any previews of interesting things to come?</h4>
<p>We&#39;re excited to explore the intersection between climate resilience and public health. Public health professionals are already witnessing climate change impacts on community health and many are leading by example to implement resilience and mitigation strategies.</p>
<h4>What is your favorite outdoor space in Boston and why?</h4>
<p>My favorite outdoor space in Boston is Franklin Park. I grew up going there regularly with my family for cookouts, to play tennis, and to attend the annual Kite Festival. The Franklin Park Coalition&#39;s Thanksgiving Turkey Trot is one of our favorite family traditions. I love that the park attracts diverse visitors and is a gathering space in our community.</p>"
470,We All Must Stand Up,<p>Stand up. Stand with. Stand for. Do.</p>,"<p>I could see it in their faces: the sorrow, at yet another unspeakable tragedy stirred by increasing forces of hatred and animus; the confusion, about how to make sense of the country we now live in where our leadership gives license to such expressions of terror; the comfort, of being surrounded by like-minded citizens, coming together to express solidarity and deepen community at such a moment of pain and sadness; and—yes—the resolve, that we have the power to change this and we must step up to our shared responsibility, unequivocally.</p>

<p>This was the scene I joined on the Boston Common on a brisk Sunday afternoon, as more than a thousand of us gathered to pay respect to the victims of a massacre at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh this past weekend.</p>

<p>And yet, this tragedy was only one of several in the past week alone, with the racially-motivated murder of two African-Americans in Louisville and the vile extremism on display with pipe bombs sent to more than a dozen critics of the President of the United States. All in one week.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--the""> <p>have</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Facing such ugliness—again and again—we cannot allow ourselves to become inured. This is not normal. This is not right. And this is not who we are.</p>

<p>More than ever, we have an obligation to be present, to stand up and be counted, and to meet the challenge of this moment head on. For those of us in philanthropy, we must determine what of our resources, power, and voice we will deploy. We may feel our greatest contribution is to speak out in defense of the ideals and values our country stands upon. We may be focused on ensuring our partners on the front lines have the support they need to face these crises. Or both. And more.</p>

<p>Regardless of how we respond, we must respond. Philanthropy means “love of mankind,” and now more than ever before, our words and our work must embody that in every way. My colleague, Grant Oliphant of the Heinz Endowments, captured this sentiment beautifully <a href=""http://www.heinz.org/blog-the-point/blog-detail/?id=58"">in his blog post</a> reminding us that “love is the cure.”</p>

<p>At Sunday’s event, I ran into the leader of one of Barr’s partner organizations, and she turned to me, with a touch of sadness in her eyes, noting: “I came directly from a rally for transgender rights to this gathering. This is how we now spend our weekends.”</p>

<p>This exchange crystallized for me what I have been moved and grateful to witness in abundance during these past few years: talented and dedicated leaders who, although they are already investing 100% and more in their organizations and missions, are also heeding the call to even greater work: that of ensuring the ideals of our country are fiercely protected, that challenges to our democracy are forcefully rebuffed, and that the most vulnerable and voiceless amongst us do not ever stand alone, but find us standing with them.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--how""> <p>of</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>At Sunday’s gathering, one of the speakers reminded us of the words of the Talmud: “Do not be daunted by the enormity of the world’s grief. Do justly now, love mercy now, walk humbly now. You are not obligated to complete the work, but neither are you free to abandon it.”</p>

<p>With all the reasons to be daunted by this moment in our nation’s history, we must draw courage from these words and resolve anew to stand up, to be counted, and to do the necessary work that bends the arc of history towards justice.</p>

468,Key Learnings and Resources from New Educator Collaborative on Mastery,"<p>Angela Duffy of Springpoint shares lessons learned and resources from Mastery Week, an online collaboration and sharing event for educators. </p>","<p>Now in its second year, Mastery Week provides a space for educators to share resources, learn from each other, and ask pressing questions on the topic of mastery. Also known as competency-based learning, mastery allows educators to establish a transparent set of learning goals with multiple opportunities for students to demonstrate mastery of key skills and content knowledge at a flexible pace.</p>

<p>As individual schools move toward full mastery implementation, they often feel isolated and eager to learn from others doing this work. We’ve found it is useful for practitioners to see strong examples, make connections with each other, and share resources so they can improve their practice and build systems.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--creates""> <p>Week</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>That’s why we at Springpoint created Mastery Week. Mastery Week provides a space to share resources, learn from each other, and ask pressing questions. Launched in 2017, the inaugural Mastery Week campaign centered on mastery communications, featuring resources and insights to help schools plan communications strategies that engage a range of stakeholders. You can find those articles and resources below.</p>

<p>This summer, we looked at measurement and assessment in a mastery-based system. We shared articles and resources, and encouraged conversations on this topic—from grading and reporting structures, to student agency, to designing individual assessments, and more. Springpoint convened partners to contribute their learnings and expertise, including <a href=""https://www.cce.org"">Center for Collaborative Education</a>, <a href=""http://www.redesignu.org/"">reDesign</a>, <a href=""https://www.nextgenlearning.org/"">NGLC</a>, <a href=""https://knowledgeworks.org/"">KnowledgeWorks</a>, <a href=""https://www.2revolutions.net/"">2 Revolutions</a>, <a href=""http://www.gettingsmart.com/"">Getting Smart</a>, and <a href=""http://www.masterycollaborative.org/"">Mastery Collaborative</a>.</p>

<p>We published a blog post highlighting four different schools’ approach to mastery assessment and introducing our newest resource: <a href=""https://www.springpointschools.org/media/2018/10/mastery-based_learning_components__key_look-fors.pdf"">Mastery-based Learning Components &amp; Key Look Fors</a>, a guiding document that offers a working definition and a concrete look at elements that live inside a mastery-based system.</p>

<p>One of the most interactive components of the week included a Twitter chat hosted by Virgel Hammonds, Chief Knowledge Officer at KnowledgeWorks. Dozens of mastery enthusiasts came together to talk about mastery assessment and make connections. We explored the purpose of assessment and discussed how mastery accelerates equity and makes room for student ownership of learning.</p>

434,Reimagining the Future of Boston’s Waterfront,<p>A recent survey of Boston residents reveals widespread support for a waterfront that is resilient and open to all.</p>,"<p>While the Boston waterfront has been the topic of conversation for several years, it is now front-and-center more than ever, with development continuing to reshape our coast on a near-constant basis and the impacts of climate change a visible and tangible reality. As part of a community of organizations deeply dedicated to the city’s waterfront and Harbor, <a href=""http://www.thetrustees.org/"">the Trustees</a> and <a href=""https://bostonwaterfrontpartners.org/"">Boston Waterfront Partners</a> have been vocal advocates for envisioning and building best-in-class, accessible, and climate-resilient open space.</p>

<p>As part of that work, and in preparation for an inaugural One Waterfront event last month, the Trustees commissioned a survey to hear directly from the citizens of Boston, gauging their opinions on the accessibility of parks and open space, the resiliency of our coast, and the benefits (economic and intrinsic) of community parks. Survey results demonstrated that Bostonians care deeply about their community, their waterfront, and its future.</p>

<p>Climate change proved to be a key issue for respondents, with 85% stating that the city is vulnerable to increasing threats to a fragile coastline. On the topic of open space, Bostonians surveyed equate parks and green spaces with several key benefits, including improvements to air quality, water, tourism, and community-building. Additionally, 71% of respondents believe there should be more public and open spaces in the city, and more than two-thirds favor policies to create more parks, gardens, and open space even if that means less traditional economic and business development in their communities.</p>

<p><img src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2719/original.jpg?1540826687"" alt=""Figure 1""></p>

<p>So why a focus on the waterfront? Three reasons:</p>

<p><strong>First, we know the public demand is there.</strong> Great American coastal cities have transformed their waterfronts over the past decade into inviting and vibrant public places with abundant open space. Boston residents want to build on our history of outstanding parks and create the best. And if it is the people’s Harbor, then we need more ways for everyone to experience the water.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--want""> <p>residents</p> </blockquote></p>

<p><strong>Second, our coastline is changing.</strong> We need to ensure we are promoting resilience wherever possible. The Trustees is responsible for more miles of coastline than even the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and we understand the issues before us. That is why we want to help build green infrastructure—parks that are far more attractive and multi-functional than seawalls, parks that will withstand the next century of change.</p>

<p><strong>Third, it’s the right time.</strong> Boston is a hub of innovation undergoing an amazing transformation. More than ever before, we are on the global stage as a place to live, work, and create, with more and more of this activity happening along the Harbor.</p>

<p>Can we do this? We can, if we act now. We have the right land available; a set of nonprofit and community-based partners working together; broad-based support from civic leadership; and, most importantly, the will and enthusiasm of Bostonians to invest in parks and open space that will both protect the city and enhance residents’ quality of life.</p>

<p>As Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said at the OneWaterfront event, “We have a historic obligation before us to protect our city from the impacts of climate change, sea-level rise, and major storms. It’s also a historic opportunity to enhance natural resources and to create a beautiful, welcoming waterfront for all to enjoy.”</p>

<p>The reimagining of the Boston waterfront is a bold goal to pursue together, now.</p>

433,Announcing the Barr-Klarman Massachusetts Arts Initiative,<p>A $25 million investment over six years in 29 Massachusetts arts organizations to strengthen financial health and capacity to adapt to change.</p>,"<p>Arts and cultural organizations have enormous potential to add value to the vibrancy, social wellbeing, and creative economies of their communities. Yet, amidst rapid change in our communities and broader society, these organizations must also grow and change. To remain relevant and to thrive, compelling artistic programming that engages diverse artists and audiences is necessary but not sufficient. Organizations also need a sound operating model with adequate and appropriate capital, and staff and board members who embrace change and cultural differences. Today, we are pleased to announce the next evolution of the Barr Foundation’s partnership with <a href=""https://klarmanfoundation.org/"">The Klarman Family Foundation</a>—the Barr-Klarman Massachusetts Arts Initiative, a $25 million investment in 29 arts and cultural organizations from across Massachusetts to strengthen these essential capacities. Last week, the foundations made the first set of three-year grants under the new initiative, marking the beginning of what is expected to be a six-year journey of learning, collaboration, and growth.</p>

<p>Organizations will receive multi-year, unrestricted operating grants. Additionally, through a grant to <a href=""http://www.tdcorp.org/"">TDC</a>, a nationally recognized nonprofit consulting and research group, organizations will participate in a learning program focused on capitalization, cultural competency, and adaptive capacity.  Organizations will also receive customized training and technical assistance, and be eligible for supplemental funds for targeted research, capacity building, and/or pilot projects.</p>

<p>The Barr-Klarman Massachusetts Arts Initiative extends a partnership that began in 2012, when the Barr Foundation and The Klarman Family Foundation launched the Barr-Klarman Arts Capacity Building Initiative, a multi-year investment to strengthen the long-term financial health of a group of 30 Boston-area arts organizations. TDC also served as initiative co-designer and technical assistance provider. Since then, the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/arts-creativity"">Barr Foundation’s Arts &amp; Creativity Strategy</a> evolved from a focus only on Boston to all of Massachusetts. A program evaluation also provided invaluable feedback from participants about what elements of the experience were most helpful to them, and how we could improve the model. And we are thrilled to bring that learning into a next manifestation of this partnership, to strengthen a group of organizations who are creating and presenting arts and creativity in communities throughout the Commonwealth.</p>

431,Boston Integrates Climate Resilience and Mitigation in Utility Planning,<p>Smart development in Boston means accounting for climate change in long-term planning and design.</p>,"<p>Two years ago, the Boston Planning &amp; Development Agency (BPDA) and the City of Boston launched the development of a <a href=""http://www.bostonplans.org/planning/planning-initiatives/boston-smart-utilities-project"">Boston Smart Utilities Vision</a>, built upon the research and analysis process (and fellowship) funded by the Barr Foundation (see <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/new-report-positions-boston-for-next-wave-of-energy-solutions"">“New Report Positions Boston for Next Wave of Energy Solutions”)</a>. The goal of the Vision is for new development in Boston to include utilities and infrastructure that are more sustainable, resilient, equitable, and affordable, to help the City meet its climate mitigation and resilience goals. </p>

<p>Achieving this Vision requires transforming the business-as-usual model of development planning across four utility sectors—energy, water, transportation, and telecommunications. After considerable collaboration between City departments, developers, and other stakeholders, BPDA now has two key tools to implement this Vision—a <em>Smart Utilities Policy</em>, and <em>Smart Utility Standards</em>.</p>

<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/BostonHarborNow/status/969935436218060800"">Knee-high water</a> at Long Wharf after the March 2018 Nor’easter that flooded downtown Boston illustrated the need to develop resilient solutions to prepare our City for climate change. But flooding is just one of the effects of these increasingly common extreme weather events.</p>

<p>Power outages across the state caused by the same Nor’easter did not affect Boston this time. However, we know how disruptive outages can be, from the 2012 blackout in the Back Bay caused by a transformer failure to widespread blackouts in New York and New Jersey after Superstorm Sandy.</p>

<p>We also know that new approaches to integrated design are necessary to achieve greater use of distributed and other clean energy sources, which will help us meet the City&#39;s climate goals.</p>

<p>So how does implementing a Smart Utilities Vision help Boston prepare for and mitigate climate change? The Smart Utility Policy will help deploy the needed technology to achieve these goals. For example, green infrastructure can be installed throughout the city to help collect greater amounts of stormwater and prevent flooding on our streets. In addition, district energy microgrids that provide power to residents and business so that they do not experience power outages can be included in the planning of new districts and neighborhoods. This technology will also help the City in the transition to carbon neutrality by 2050.</p>

<p>There are many challenges in deploying these new technologies, including the fact that water, telecommunications, and energy systems must coexist under our streets. The Boston Smart Utilities Vision faced the challenge of meeting our climate goals while grappling with the reality of limited space under our streets by seeing it as an opportunity to develop a new approach for integrated design of these systems.  </p>
<h3>Sustainable, Resilient, and Equitable Economic Development: The Benefits of the Smart Utilities Vision</h3>
<p>Development of the Boston Smart Utilities Vision and the work to implement it is guided by an overarching set of goals:  </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sustainability &amp; Efficiency:</strong> Incentivize utilities that are easier to build, maintain and upgrade, minimizing the need for repetitive street openings, as well as utilities that help the city transition away from fossil fuels.<br></li>
<li><strong>Equity:</strong> Increase the access to more efficient and better quality of utility services, and reduce energy, water, and telecommunication costs for residents and businesses. </li>
<li><strong>Resiliency:</strong> Harden infrastructure against extreme weather events like flooding and heat waves, and use technologies that are more flexible and help meet resident and businesses needs more locally. </li>
<li><strong>Economic Development:</strong> Attract businesses through world-class utility services, and improve business continuity through reduced utility service interruptions.</li>
<li><strong>Innovation:</strong> Prepare the City for the integration and deployment of new smart technologies in the future. </li>
</ul>

<p>The Boston Smart Utilities Vision supports several City-wide strategic plans, including <a href=""https://imagine.boston.gov/?utm_source=Master+Press+List&utm_campaign=00992b982d-Feb_Board_2_9_18_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_d5bf6a1449-00992b982d-&mc_cid=00992b982d&mc_eid=%5BUNIQID%5D"">Imagine Boston 2030</a>, <a href=""https://www.boston.gov/departments/transportation/go-boston-2030"">GoBoston 2030</a>, <a href=""http://www.100resilientcities.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Boston-Resilience-Strategy-Reduced-PDF.pdf?utm_source=Master+Press+List&utm_campaign=00992b982d-Feb_Board_2_9_18_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_d5bf6a1449-00992b982d-&mc_cid=00992b982d&mc_eid=%5BUNIQID%5D"">Resilient Boston</a>, and <a href=""http://www.100resilientcities.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Boston-Resilience-Strategy-Reduced-PDF.pdf?utm_source=Master+Press+List&utm_campaign=00992b982d-Feb_Board_2_9_18_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_d5bf6a1449-00992b982d-&mc_cid=00992b982d&mc_eid=%5BUNIQID%5D"">Climate Ready Boston</a>.</p>
<h3>A Synergistic Approach: Collaboration Among Multiple Agencies and Departments</h3>
<p>Flooding and power outages are not the only reasons to rethink smarter planning for utilities. Space under our streets also needs to accommodate telecommunications and transportation technologies that improve traffic management, alleviate congestion, and enhance safety. A future that supports all of these technologies requires enlarging the lens through which each individual technology is approached.</p>

<p>Led by the BPDA, the Boston Smart Utilities Steering Committee involved seven departments and agencies. This extraordinary collaboration resulted in two implementation tools that will help change the “business-as-usual” approach to development planning: one that enhances innovation and another that achieves coordinated planning under our streets across the four utility sectors.</p>
<h3>Two Implementation Tools:  Policy and Standards</h3>
<p>The first implementation tool is the <a href=""http://www.bostonplans.org/getattachment/7b87a301-95da-4723-b3a9-02bfebd1b109""><em>Smart Utilities Policy</em></a>, adopted by the BPDA Board in June 2018. It calls for the integration of five smart utility technologies in new developments:</p>

<ul>
<li>District Energy Microgrids</li>
<li>Telecommunications Utilidor</li>
<li>Green Infrastructure</li>
<li>Adaptive Signal Technology</li>
<li>Smart Street Lights</li>
</ul>

<p>The second tool is the <em>Smart Utility Standards</em>, a guide book similar to <em>Boston Complete Streets</em>, which sets forth standards for the design of utility infrastructure under the streets. These standards will serve as guidelines for the planning and coordination of utilities, including the needed infrastructure for the five smart technologies in the <em>Smart Utilities Policy</em>.</p>

<p>We are currently working closely with projects undergoing BPDA’s development review process to ensure that they are adopting these two implementation tools adequately. In the near future we will have a Smart Utilities Checklist that will guide project teams through these requirements.</p>

<p>Both the <em>Smart Utilities Policy</em> and the <em>Smart Utility Standards</em> will allow Boston to continue its progress to become a more resilient, carbon neutral city. Successful implementation of these new tools requires continued multi-stakeholder collaboration, and will benefit the residents of Boston in sustainable, resilient, and equitable ways. </p>"
428,29 Foundations Pledge Over $4 Billion to Address Climate Change,"<p>Barr commits at least $100 million over the next five years, joining the largest-ever philanthropic investment in climate change mitigation.</p>","<p>As Hurricane Florence ravages the Carolina coast and southeastern United States, we see yet again how climate change is affecting people’s lives. Whether through ferocious hurricanes, storm surge, and floods or via extreme heat, raging wildfires, and catastrophic droughts, our steadily warming planet is causing real suffering for people around the world, with direct impacts on health and well-being.</p>

<p>At the same time, this crisis has spurred action that is demonstrating the power of innovation, the imperative for leadership, and the need for investment.  As just one example, thanks to bold, forward-looking energy policies, Massachusetts’ clean energy industry reached more than 109,000 jobs in 2017, an increase of 81 percent – outpacing employment growth across all sectors. And the State is also partnering with other states in the Northeast to harness market forces to reduce emissions from the energy and transportation sectors (through, respectively, the highly effective <a href=""https://www.rggi.org/"">Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative</a> and newly formed <a href=""http://www.georgetownclimate.org/transportation/transportation-and-climate-initiative.html"">Transportation and Climate Initiative)</a>.</p>

<p>We have also seen significant growth in the number, variety, and scale of philanthropy engaged in these efforts.</p>

<p>The Barr Foundation has made addressing climate change one of its central priorities. Since pledging $50 million over five years in 2010, Barr has awarded over $130 million across three priority areas in climate – <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/climate/clean-energy"">clean energy</a>, <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/climate/mobility"">mobility</a>, and <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/climate/climate-resilience"">resilience</a>. And today, Barr is proud to increase and extend that commitment.</p>

<p>Over the next five years, Barr plans to commit at least $100 million to climate efforts in our region. And we are pleased to do so in concert with 28 other foundations, who as part of the Global Climate Action Summit in California area collectively committing $4 billion, <a href=""https://hewlett.org/newsroom/philanthropic-community-announces-4-billion-commitment-to-combat-climate-change/"">the largest-ever philanthropic investment</a> in climate change mitigation.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--next""> <p>the</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>As large as this figure is, we know it is only a down payment. Addressing one of the most pressing challenges of our time will require all sectors to engage deeply and invest significantly. Both the business community and the public sector must be a part of this effort along with private philanthropy. And this is not just an issue for national or global foundations; it matters locally as well. Every foundation has an important role to play – as Kate Wolford of the Minneapolis-based McKnight Foundation and I shared in <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/chronicle-of-philanthropy-fighting-global-climate-change-requires-foundations-to-give-local"">our joint Op-Ed in the Chronicle of Philanthropy</a>, reflecting on three tools available to any local climate funder.</p>

<p>At Barr, we are committing to help accelerate innovation, adoption, and scale of climate solutions across our region. And we also aim to catalyze broader action beyond the geographic reach of our direct giving, to support people of vision, hope, and courage in all parts of the globe, who are fighting to protect the air they breathe and the places they call home.</p>

<p>Here in Boston, we have experienced a greater frequency of major winter storms, more frequent flooding due to sea level rise, and one of the hottest summers on record.  It has proven yet again what we have known for a while: we have no time to lose, and we must take action. We plan to do our part and are grateful to those partners and allies who have also embraced the challenge.</p>

427,Evaluation in the Service of Learning,<p>Our Director of Learning and Evaluation shares three changes to make learning and evaluation efforts more beneficial to our partners and others.</p>,"<p>As I approach the one-year mark in my role leading Barr’s efforts to build and improve learning and evaluation practices, I&#39;m excited to share a few updates.</p>

<p>For us, learning is not limited to the work of our programs, but also includes feedback from our partners. Recently, we were fortunate to hear from grantees via our Grantee Perception Report survey which included feedback on our learning and evaluation practices. We reflected on the responses we received in relation to Barr’s values and examples of strong practice among our peers, and identified ways to improve:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Make evaluations more collaborative and beneficial to our partners.</strong> We heard from our grantees that participating in evaluations funded by Barr hasn’t always felt useful or applicable to their work. We are adopting approaches to evaluation that prioritize grantee input and benefit. For example, in our Creative Commonwealth Initiative, we included grantees in the evaluation design phase. Based on their input, we modified and prioritized our evaluation questions and also incorporated flexible technical assistance to build their capacity for data and measurement. In our <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/reports/engage-new-england-phase-1-evaluation"">Engage New England evaluation</a>, the evaluation is initially focused on sharing learning with grantees and to the partners supporting their work. </li>
<li><strong>Be clearer about how we measure outcomes.</strong> Our grantees want to know how Barr assesses their progress. In September, we published <a href=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/528/attachments/Barr_Grantee_Output_and_Outcomes_Guide_2023.pdf?1681485315"">a grantee guide to outputs and outcomes</a>, to clarify what we are looking for from grantees; and our program teams are clarifying progress measures for our strategies overall so that we can make that information more accessible to our grantees. </li>
<li><strong>Share what we learn.</strong> To quote a recent <a href=""http://www.grantcraft.org/guides/open-for-good"">Open for Good</a> report by Grantcraft, “Knowledge has the power to spark change, but only if it is shared.” To maximize Barr’s impact, we want to produce and share insights that are useful to practitioners, policymakers, and others beyond our grantees and partners. To this end, we are actively sharing information about evaluation work in progress, including questions we are exploring and timing of results we can share with the field; our <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/reports/barr-fellowship-evaluation"">Barr Fellows program evaluation</a> is an example. We are also working to highlight and share research and reports from our partners via Barr&#39;s <a href=""https://www.issuelab.org/funders/profile/barr_foundation"">new knowledge center</a>. By sharing work in progress, as well as results and lessons learned, we hope to inform the practices of nonprofits and other funders, advance field knowledge, inform public policy, and elevate community expertise.</li>
</ol>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--the""> <p>has</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>We remain focused on evaluation that is <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/value-of-constructive-feedback-in-philanthropy"">meaningful, actionable, and manageable</a>. For more details, visit our new dedicated page, <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/impact-learning"">Impact &amp; Learning</a>, where we describe how learning and evaluation at Barr is designed to strengthen our grantees, improve practice and policy in the areas where we work, and maximize the impact of Barr’s resources over time. I welcome your feedback and look forward to sharing more about our progress as our learning and evaluation work evolves.</p>"
426,We Can Improve Coastal Communities as We Protect Them,"<p>The best way to protect Boston from rising seas is through “shore-based solutions.” Two of the authors of a recent report explain what that means, and how such solutions can yield benefits for communities.</p>","<p>One of the biggest challenges facing Greater Boston is coastal flooding. As weather gets more extreme and sea levels continue to rise, this is a challenge that government and business leaders, researchers, and communities are working together to solve.</p>

<p>Against this challenge, many had placed hope in the idea of a harbor barrier as a silver bullet for protecting neighborhoods. Our organization, the <a href=""https://www.umb.edu/ssl/contact/ssl_email_list"">Sustainable Solutions Lab at UMass Boston</a>, recently conducted the first <a href=""https://www.umb.edu/news/detail/umass_boston_report_boston_harbor_barrier_costs_would_outweigh_benefits"">feasibility analysis</a> of this concept. We concluded that a harbor barrier would face serious technical challenges and not be worth the massive investment required. Another option is shore-based solutions – which the City <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/from-planning-to-action-preparing-boston-for-a-changing-climate"">is already beginning to implement</a>, and which can include physical measures such as elevated green spaces, raised boardwalks or deployable floodwalls and policy solutions such as changes to zoning. We found that, compared to a harbor-wide barrier, shore-based solutions are vastly more cost-effective, and that they also provide significant “co-benefits” – i.e., positive community outcomes in addition to keeping Boston safe from coastal flooding.</p>

<p>While it was outside the scope of this study to explore the extent of these potential co-benefits, we have been working with the Boston Green Ribbon Commission, Neighborhood of Affordable Housing in East Boston and other partners to explore the potential of shore-based solutions. Through this work and success stories in other cities, we have found that if shore-based solutions are implemented thoughtfully, they can significantly improve quality of life and access to important resources and opportunities. Some of these benefits can include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Protection against rising temperatures.</strong> Shore-based solutions provide an opportunity for increased tree cover and green infrastructure in neighborhoods that deal with urban “heat island” impacts likely to intensify over the course of the century.</li>
<li><strong>More democratic participation in the development of the future of the city.</strong> With a strong public process in place, communities can decide how to protect their neighborhoods and co-create solutions using a wide variety of physical (e.g. parks, protective greenery, floodable basketball courts, etc.) or policy tools. </li>
<li><strong>Engagement and targeted investment in local business.</strong> These community processes can be opportunities to engage local expertise and business leaders, including helping identify opportunities to target investments in local efforts that, historically, may have lacked access to funding, such as women- and minority-owned businesses. </li>
<li><strong>Flexibility, creativity, and innovation in public realm planning – with less risk.</strong> Parks and other adaptation features can be built in a modular way that allows for iterative learning and more investment later.</li>
<li><strong>Economic development through “climate tourism.”</strong> People around the world could look to Boston for our innovative approaches to adaptation through popular harbor tourist spaces. </li>
</ul>

<p>Creating a resilient city isn’t easy and none of these benefits is a given. In fact, <a href=""http://news.rice.edu/2018/08/20/natural-disasters-widen-racial-wealth-gap-2/"">research has shown that</a>, if we are not careful, our attempts to address climate change can even exacerbate social and economic inequities that already exist. For example, green infrastructure investments can accelerate gentrification, making it challenging for the people who advocated for new investments to stay in their neighborhood. As we develop climate change policies we need to have a holistic approach which, in this case, could include preserving and even increasing affordable housing.</p>

<p>We at SSL are particularly interested in how these climate adaptation investments can be leveraged to safeguard the region’s most vulnerable populations. We will be exploring these topics in future research and invite you to subscribe to our email list to learn more. Many questions around financing, governance, and project sequencing remain, but with continued cooperation, we can work together to ensure resilience planning supports communities while protecting them.</p>

425,"Creating Space for Change by Asking, “Why?”",<p>A new video series engages millions in questioning longstanding education practices that are ripe for a rethink.</p>,"<p><em>This post was updated in October 2019 with two new additions to the &quot;Ask Why?&quot; video series</em></p>

<p>Sometimes, a first step to catalyze change is creating ways for people to see old things with new eyes. If we’ve been doing things a certain way for as long as anyone can remember, it’s easy to forget that the status quo is actually a choice, or that we have the power to make different choices.</p>

<p>Recently, Barr’s Education Team partnered with colleagues at the Nellie Mae Education Foundation and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation to support a series of short videos aimed at sparking new conversations and thinking about some of the ways we approach education in this country that – when looked at anew – don’t make much sense.</p>

<p>The series, titled, “Ask Why?” was produced by <a href=""https://thisis180.com/"">180 Studio</a> in partnership with <a href=""https://education-reimagined.org/"">Education Reimagined</a>, which brought content expertise, and <a href=""https://www.attn.com/"">ATTN:</a> an issues-driven media company that averages 2 billion monthly impressions and 25 million monthly engagements across social media. Rather than focus only on creating high-quality content and trying to draw visitors to see and engage with it on our own communications channels, we hoped ATTN: would carry it to where its target audiences were already active and engaged.</p>

424,Barr Awards $1.26 Million for New England Civil Rights Fund,<p>Fourteen organizations supported as part of 2018 Special Initiative.</p>,"<p>We live in times that compel us to work differently. At a moment when so many of our neighbors are targeted and marginalized as a direct result of the policies and directives of our current president and his administration, we cannot pretend it is business as usual.</p>

<p>For us at Barr, this led our trustees to <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/supporting-new-england-communities-under-threat-and-ensuring-a-fair-and-accurate-census-count"">announce earlier this year a $3-million expansion</a> of a 2017 Special Initiative to support New England communities under threat and to ensure a fair and accurate 2020 Census count in the region. Moreover, in determining how best to allocate those resources, we were eager to identify new potential partners beyond Barr’s existing networks and to support organizations and efforts across New England, as fewer philanthropic resources tend to be available outside of larger metropolitan regions.</p>

<p>To that end, earlier this summer we issued <a href=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/213/attachments/Barr_Fdn_New_England_Civil_Rights_Fund_RFP.pdf?1527626673"">a request for proposals (RFP)</a> for the New England Civil Rights Fund, open to all organizations working in support of, and in partnership with, immigrants and refugees, Muslims, communities of color, and LGBTQ communities to support civil rights protections and strengthen community capacity to respond to new challenges.</p>

<p>The response to the RFP was overwhelming: 92 organizations from all six New England states submitted proposals. About three quarters of the proposals came from Massachusetts-based organizations, and of those, more than a third were from organizations beyond Greater Boston. We were both moved and daunted by this robust response, knowing that it represents far more need than any one foundation can address.</p>

<p>Barr had originally allocated $1 million for this fund. In view of the response and strength of proposals, I am pleased to report that our trustees increased the allocation to the New England Civil Rights Fund by 25%, allowing us to award 14 grants totaling $1.26 million.</p>

<p>Below are the recipient organizations, with each grant awarded for a 24-month period:</p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://acechildren.org"">African Community Education (ACE)</a></strong>, Worcester, Mass.<br>
<em>$80,000 to provide core support</em></p>

<p>The capacity for foundations to remain adaptive—both in what they do and in how they do it—remains essential in these times. When our values are under attack, when the rights of residents and neighbors are being stripped away, and when those who do vital work on the front lines are overwhelmed by the demand for their services, we must ask ourselves: What can we do to help?</p>

<p>At Barr, we are striving to do our part while sustaining our commitments to our core programs in Arts &amp; Creativity, Climate, and Education. We draw inspiration from the partners listed above—and others we have been privileged to support—for the critical work they are doing every day to ensure civil rights for all.</p>

But funding for risk-taking is often hard to come by. With new resources dedicated to artistic risk, seven organizations pushed themselves beyond their comfort zones.

<p><div class=""Media -full""> <div class=""u-fluid-iframe""> <div class=""u-fluid-iframe-inner""> <iframe src=""//player.vimeo.com/video/286424512?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0"" title=""Featured Video"" frameborder=""0"" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen loading=""lazy""> <a href=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/286424512?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0"">A video on Vimeo</a> </iframe> </div> </div> </div></p>

<p>Creating and presenting art is always about taking risks. The work we present at the ICA is frequently unknown and under-resourced, and often underappreciated. To advise and inspire us, and to help us achieve our mission of sharing the pleasures and provocations of the art of our time, we invited a group of artists, all of whom had exhibited their work at the ICA, to serve as an Artist Advisory Council.</p>

<p>These artists represent many different disciplines, and a variety of gender, racial, generational, and geographic backgrounds. The issues we discussed are complex and personal, and our conversations were, too. But artists are some of the best problem solvers in the world. They create ways that invite us, and sometimes jolt us, into looking at things it might be easier to look away from. Artists create openings for new perspectives, people, and ideas that may be outside the mainstream, but often turn out to be exactly what we need.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--some""> <p>are</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>This project represented a different kind of risk for us. It was an opportunity to look at ourselves, and the experience we create for our artists and our audiences, through their eyes. It was an incredible gift and one that will endure at the ICA.</p>

<p>We invite you to share this story of artistic risk-taking, and to join the conversation using <a href=""https://twitter.com/search?q=%23artisticrisk&src=typd"">#ArtisticRisk</a>.</p>
<h3>About the Barr-Klarman Arts Capacity Building Initiative and this video series:</h3>
<p>The Barr-Klarman Arts Capacity Building Initiative was a five-year initiative to strengthen the long term financial health of a group of Boston area arts organizations. Throughout the Initiative, the partners grappled with the question: capitalization to what end? What’s the desired change for the organization and for our communities? First, the cohort explored what organizational risks could look like, and the kinds of capital needed. And in the last two years, the partners asked what taking risks in the art and curation looked like, and what kinds of support are needed for risk-taking. A fund was set up as part of the Initiative, with the goal of supporting projects that took organizations out of the comfort zone of their usual practice, potentially against standard field practice, and with the potential to change their organizational way of working.</p>

<p>These commissioned videos document the journey of the seven projects that were funded. Each video centers on one organization and, through the eyes of its leaders, gives a glimpse into their journey of artistic risk-taking. We hope that these leaders and projects will engage you in a conversation that deepens understanding and builds support for this exciting kind of work.</p>

421,Community Foundations Launch Regional Arts Initiatives,"<p>Six months into the Barr Foundation’s Creative Commonwealth Initiative, our partners are creating change across Massachusetts. Here are some highlights on progress, milestones, and impacts of their promising early efforts.</p>","<p>Since we launched the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/creative-commonwealth"">Creative Commonwealth Initiative</a> in January, we have been inspired by the tremendous, thoughtful work of our community foundation partners. Their efforts are already invigorating the arts in their regions, bringing together leaders from the creative and other sectors, and helping arts organizations engage with new audiences – including many who have not, historically, felt that arts in their communities were for them.</p>

<p>Later this year, we’ll have the chance to hear on this blog directly from the Creative Commonwealth foundation presidents. They’ll share about the distinctive approaches they are taking, the impacts their efforts are having, and what they are learning along the way. Until then, we wanted to highlight some of the impressive progress and milestones they’ve already achieved, and how the impacts of their efforts are beginning to play out.</p>
<h3>Essex County Community Foundation:</h3>
<p>Essex County Community Foundation (ECCF) launched its <a href=""http://eccf.org/creative-county"">Creative County Initiative</a> with a highly successful day-long Arts &amp; Culture Summit on April 13. Attended by over 400 artists, arts organization leaders, municipal leaders, educators, board members, and philanthropists, the Summit focused on creative placemaking, cultural planning, and public art. Many colleagues from the Creative Commonwealth Initiative also attended. To further develop regional identity and cohesion, ECCF also developed an online art hub (<a href=""https://www.essexcountycreates.org/"">Essex County Creates</a>) which will be widely promoted this fall, with 100 arts and culture organizations sharing their events and experiences across the county.  In late July ECCF announced 11 creative placemaking and public arts grants to cross-sector partnerships in the amount of $300,000.  This Fall, sub-regional workshops for municipal cultural plans will be take place and will influence a county-wide cultural planning process in early 2019.</p>
<h3>The Community Foundation of Western Massachusetts:</h3>
<p>The Community Foundation of Western Massachusetts (CFWM) planning process led to a deep re-examination of whom CFWM was serving compared to the demographics of its region. This analysis resulted in a focus on communities and organizations who traditionally have not been served by the Foundation and adopting a set of values related to diversity, equity, and inclusion for its <a href=""http://www.valleycreates.org/"">ValleyCreates initiative</a>. CFWM also engaged five community advisors with close ties to communities outside its existing networks. In its first year, ValleyCreates will provide:</p>

<ol>
<li>An organizational effectiveness training series for small arts and creativity organizations;</li>
<li>Planning grants to promote collaborative and cross-sector innovation for arts &amp; creativity organizations; and </li>
<li>A request for proposals for an online hub to foster connection and support for arts organizations across the three-county region.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Greater Worcester Community Foundation:</h3>
<p>As part of its <a href=""http://www.greaterworcester.org/Grants/Grant-Opportunities/Creative-Commonwealth-Initiative"">Creative Worcester initiative</a>, the Greater Worcester Community Foundation (GWCF) rolled out two new grant programs: Creative Spark and Creative Community Engagement. In response to Worcester’s changing demographics, both programs seek to support projects and organizations that engage under-served populations and amplify under-heard voices.  In this first year of the initiative, the Creative Spark grant program awarded over $69,000 in mini-grants to eleven organizations and artists; and, the Creative Engagement grant program awarded $300,000 in operating support grants to five organizations. In addition, in August the Foundation, in partnership with the City of Worcester and the Worcester Cultural Coalition, will begin the process of developing a cultural plan to stand alongside the City’s current master planning process.</p>
<h3>Berkshire Taconic Community Foundation:</h3>
<p>At the end of May, <a href=""https://www.berkshiretaconic.org/"">Berkshire Taconic Community Foundation</a> (BTCF), in partnership with
Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts, launched an arts education initiative for arts organizations, public school leaders, and teachers – an idea that had emerged as a priority from BTCF’s planning process. To inform the development and implementation of its grantmaking and capacity-building programs, BTCF has contracted an academic researcher to analyze community-based research on barriers to the arts. Later this summer, BTCF will launch an arts and culture donor affinity group to increase donor engagement with the arts.</p>
<h3>Community Foundation of Southeastern Massachusetts:</h3>
<p>In June, the <a href=""https://www.cfsema.org/"">Community Foundation of Southeastern Massachusetts</a> (CFSEMA) initiated a round of grants in New Bedford and Fall River, specifically seeking projects that would take public art to an exciting new level while engaging youth and amplifying the contributions of culturally diverse populations. CFSEMA received 35 proposals for exciting projects that range from compelling and contemporary murals to festivals celebrating new populations, and that show ideas for engaging communities in innovative and collaborative ways. Grants will be announced in September. Additionally, informed by findings from a community survey, CFSEMA will launch a new Capacity Building series. Community members and leaders are energized by all of the creative possibilities and partnerships for the South Coast.</p>

<p>To help launch and sustain these various efforts, and to expand philanthropy for arts and creativity in their regions, two of our partners have already met and exceeded the 20 percent match we set as a condition of Barr’s support, and all are on target to meet that goal. The Creative Community foundation presidents have been such effective leaders in this work, and are already inspiring shifts in grantmaking practices and in organizational culture. These efforts have also elevated their visibility as community leaders, and created new ways for them to engage their board members, donors, and local municipal leaders in creating more vital, vibrant, and engaged communities.</p>

419,New Report Reveals Growth Trends in Rapidly Changing U.S. Energy Market,"<p>Third annual assessment of energy employment at federal, state, and county levels finds over 6.5 million workers, with half of 133,000 new jobs focused on energy efficiency.</p>","<p>The National Association of State Energy Officials (NASEO) and the Energy Futures Initiative recently released the <a href=""https://www.usenergyjobs.org/"">2018 U.S. Energy and Employment Report (USEER)</a> with support from the Barr Foundation and several other funders. The USEER provides the most comprehensive calculation of energy-related employment that is publicly available. BW Research Partnership, a leading economic and workforce research firm, conducted the employer survey and data analysis in partnership with USEER author David Foster, Energy Futures Initiative Distinguished Associate.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -aside -left""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img alt=""A graphic showing where the energy jobs are in the United States"" class=""Media-image"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2601/crop_preview.png?1642123960"" /> </div> </div></p>

<p>Now in its third year of publication, this seminal survey and report of energy sector employment at the national, state, and county levels provides a rigorous, independent analysis of the U.S. energy market. With profound implications for the broader economy, investors, and the environment, the U.S. energy market is large, growing rapidly, and it is undergoing significant evolution. In this context, USEER data and findings are important for informing workforce initiatives and programs, state and federal energy and employment policies, and corporate investments.</p>
<h3>Among the key findings of the report:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The U.S. energy market accounts for millions of jobs.</strong> In 2017, 6.56 million Americans work in the energy sector overall, including electric power generation and fuels; transmission distribution, and storage; energy efficiency; and motor vehicles. This represents an increase of 133,000 jobs (or 2 percent) over the year before. Jobs in energy accounted for nearly 7 percent of all new jobs nationwide.</li>
<li><strong>Energy efficiency is the largest energy employment segment, and is experiencing rapid growth.</strong> Approximately 2.25 million people spent some or all of their time working on delivering energy efficiency technologies and services last year. Of the 7.1 million construction workers in the United States, about 18 percent support the construction or installation of energy-efficient technologies. Construction employers project 11 percent in energy efficiency-related jobs by the end of 2018. </li>
<li><strong>Natural gas electric generation jobs continue to grow.</strong> In 2017, the natural gas industry added over 19,000 new jobs, as natural gas continued its climb as the number one fuel for electricity generation in the country.</li>
<li><strong>Hiring difficulty is an ever-present reality in the energy industry.</strong> Over 70 percent of employers reported difficulty recruiting qualified workers, most often attributed to lack of experience, training, or technical skills. </li>
<li><strong>The energy industry faces workplace diversity challenges.</strong> Women and people of color are underrepresented across energy industry segments relative to the U.S. economy as a whole, highlighting the need for placement, training, and Human Resources programs that place an emphasis on diversity and access.</li>
</ul>

<p>Recognizing the vast economic and job creation benefits that energy sector employment can unlock, state energy offices in New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont, along with the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, have complemented the USEER with in-depth studies of the clean energy industry in their respective states.  The findings have helped inform these states’ policy and program efforts.</p>

<p>For instance, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority has used the <a href=""https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/About/Publications/2017-New-York-Clean-Energy-Industry-Report"">New York Clean Energy Industry Report</a> as an annual tool to measure the economic impacts of Governor Cuomo’s <a href=""https://rev.ny.gov/"">Reforming the Energy Vision</a> strategy and to inform policies that advance its goal of creating new jobs and business opportunities in the state (in 2016, New York’s clean energy jobs grew by 3.4%, well exceeding the 1.9% employment growth experienced economy wide).  In Rhode Island, the <a href=""http://www.energy.ri.gov/documents/News/RI%202017%20Clean%20Energy%20Industry%20Report.pdf"">2017 Clean Energy Industry Report</a> produced by the Office of Energy Resources and the Executive Office of Commerce revealed that clean energy jobs have grown by an astounding 66% since 2014, providing immense benefits to in-state trade and local supply chains.  </p>

<p>For Advanced Energy Economy and its member companies, the USEER and its underlying survey reveal important trends in the growing advanced energy industry. Employment in energy efficiency grew 3 percent last year, adding 67,000 jobs nationally, demonstrating the economic value of energy- and money-saving products and services. Employment also grew in several other advanced energy segments as well, including wind energy, combined heat and power, geothermal, low-impact hydropower, and energy storage. While jobs in solar power declined slightly, most of that contraction was in two states where the solar industry grew fastest in past years and is now maturing, while in most other states solar jobs continue to grow. This is evidence of a dynamic industry that is changing the way we make, use, and manage energy – and supporting U.S. jobs along the way.</p>

418,Investing in a Strong Nonprofit Sector,<p>Refined guiding principles and new name for Barr’s grantmaking aimed at strengthening New England’s nonprofit sector.</p>,"<p>At the Barr Foundation, we believe strategic, long-term focus is key to impact. We dedicate most of our resources to three core program areas—Arts &amp; Creativity, Climate, and Education. Each has clearly defined goals and strategies.</p>

<p>We also embrace our responsibility to help strengthen three elements that are essential for progress in these focus areas and, in fact, all efforts to realize social change:</p>

<ul>
<li>Building more <strong>effective, inclusive leadership.</strong></li>
<li>Improving <strong>decision-making</strong> on significant public issues.</li>
<li>Bolstering core <strong>infrastructure</strong> for the social sector.</li>
</ul>

<p>To embody that responsibility, Barr <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/introducing-cross-program-initiatives"">announced</a> two years ago what we initially called Cross-Program Initiatives, focused on leadership, decision-making, and infrastructure. Since then, we have developed greater clarity about what we mean in each area, and how they contribute to a more effective social sector. We have also renamed this portfolio &quot;Sector Effectiveness&quot; to better reflect its purpose and the work we support. Here are the principles that guide us in this work; more information on what we fund can be found on the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/sector-effectiveness"">Sector Effectiveness</a> website.</p>
<h3>Strong, inclusive, and effective leadership requires:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Organizations that are attentive not only to the senior executive, but to the leadership team, governance, and opportunities and conditions for leadership throughout organizations.</li>
<li>Inclusive organizations with both a robust, diverse, and well-prepared leadership pipeline, and attentiveness to diversity, inclusion, and equity in policy, practice, and culture.</li>
<li>Effective approaches to leadership development, including cohort-based and other peer-exchange learning methods.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sound decision-making requires:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Credible and objective research and data as a critical foundation for effective organizational operations, public discourse, and policy.</li>
<li>Intentional efforts to build demand for credible data, and to ensure that data include diverse constituent voices.</li>
<li>Strategic communications and engagement to ensure the uptake and application of information in policy-making and practice.</li>
<li>Investment to understand and support the most effective ways to bridge divides and divisive cultures.</li>
</ul>
<h3>A strong and effective nonprofit and philanthropic sector requires field infrastructure organizations that help advance:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A policy environment that supports all nonprofits in pursuing their missions.</li>
<li>Capable and respected intermediaries that can enhance the effectiveness of organizations.</li>
<li>Field-building functions, such as the development and dissemination of knowledge and effective practices.</li>
<li>Networked and collaborative leadership and organizations.</li>
</ul>

<p>As we have begun this work, we have been privileged to sustain longstanding programs like the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/barr-fellowship"">Barr Fellowship</a>, and to support new and longtime partners advancing these aims. You can explore all of our partners and the work we support in our <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/grantmaking/grants?query=&program_areas%5B%5D=sector_effectiveness#Grants"">online grants database</a>.</p>

<p>The work of the social sector is essential to strengthening our communities and improving outcomes for all. Barr is invested in the health and effectiveness of the sector, and we know much more can be done. We welcome your insights and ideas as we continue to explore opportunities to strengthen our sector.</p>"
417,New Study Identifies Massive Risk to Coastal Property from Sea Level Rise,<p>Five key takeaways from analysis predicting heavy losses for those with stake in waterfront real estate across the United States.</p>,"<p>Last month, the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) released a <a href=""https://www.ucsusa.org/global-warming/global-warming-impacts/sea-level-rise-chronic-floods-and-us-coastal-real-estate-implications#.W0TpOH4pBTY"">report</a> analyzing the impacts of sea level rise and tidal flooding on coastal real estate, and the results are sobering. Within the next 30 years—the lifespan of a typical mortgage—with a high sea level rise scenario, as many as 311,000 coastal homes, worth a total of $117.5 billion today, are at risk of chronic flooding. Chronic flooding refers to high tide flooding that occurs 26 or more times per year. By the end of the century, with that same scenario, roughly 2.5 million homes and businesses, currently worth more than $1 trillion altogether, could be at risk. The properties at risk by the end of the century are home to an estimated 4.7 million people today—the equivalent of the population of Louisiana.</p>

<p>UCS has been researching the risks associated with sea level rise for the past six years. As those risks have come into focus, we have also seen and listened to countless stories of continued development along our coasts. We knew that the near-term risk to coastal properties was flying under the radar, and we wanted to make those who have a stake in coastal real estate—from individual homeowners and local municipal governments to lenders, insurers and credit rating agencies—aware of the risks they could be facing.</p>

<p>So we combined two existing sources of information: data UCS previously published on coastal regions that are projected to experience this chronic flooding and data on existing properties provided by Zillow, the online real estate company. We coupled this analysis with an extensive series of interviews with market experts to better understand the economic implications of the risks we had identified. And we made our results available in easy-to-navigate <a href=""https://ucsusa.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=cf07ebe0a4c9439ab2e7e346656cb239"">online maps</a>.</p>
<h3>Here are five key takeaways from the report:</h3><h4>1. All coastal states will be affected by chronic flooding due to sea level rise in the coming decades, with Florida and New Jersey acutely exposed.</h4>
<p><img src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2589/original.png?1531245900"" alt=""Figure 1"">
<em>In the contiguous US, roughly 311,000 existing homes are projected to be at risk of chronic inundation by 2045, and nearly 2.4 million are at risk by the end of the century. Data provided by third parties through the Zillow Transaction and Assessment Dataset (ZTRAX).</em></p>

<p>Within the next 30 years, chronic flooding will threaten properties in every coastal state. For Florida and New Jersey, where heavy development has taken place on barrier islands and other low-lying land, the risks are particularly stark. By 2045, more than 60,000 homes and $26 billion in today’s property value are at risk in each of those two states. By the end of the century, Florida alone accounts for nearly half of the at-risk homes in the nation.</p>
<h4>2. Chronic flooding will exacerbate existing challenges for many low income and blue-collar communities.</h4>
<p>Generally, wealthier homeowners with higher value homes stand to lose more in total dollars to chronic flooding than lower-income homeowners, but the latter stand to lose more of their total wealth. In Louisiana and Maryland, for example, exposure to chronic flooding and poverty intersect to create hotspots of risk. And in eight states—including Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Mississippi, and Oregon—60 percent or more of the homes at risk of chronic inundation within the next 30 years are valued below the state median, which suggests that blue collar homeowners in those states could face heavy losses.</p>

<h4>3. The financial impacts of chronic inundation will reverberate throughout the economy.</h4>
<p>The declining value of coastal homes will be damaging, even devastating, to individual homeowners. It will also have more widespread consequences for affected communities, lenders, investors, and taxpayers. Unlike housing market corrections of the past, where property values largely rebounded, chronically-flooded properties will only go further underwater, raising the urgent need for solutions across sectors.</p>

<em>Stakeholders in the coastal real estate market.</em>       </p>
<h4>4. The financial risks of SLR are largely unaccounted for the current market.</h4>
<p>Interviews with market experts revealed that while there is a growing awareness that the financial risks of sea level rise are real and significant, they are largely unaccounted for in the current market and there are barriers to incorporating those risks. You can read these illuminating perspectives <a href=""https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2018/06/underwater-insights-from-market-experts.pdf"">here</a>.</p>
<h4>5. We need to act now to help communities adapt and limit the magnitude of the changes ahead.</h4>
<p>UCS’s report focuses on a high sea level rise scenario, one that is recommended for use in situations where there is a low tolerance for risk. But we also analyzed a low sea level rise scenario that’s predicated on there being a rapid decline in our carbon emissions and a limited amount of ice melt. The differences between the scenarios are profound: Nearly 85 percent of the homes at risk with the high scenario could avoid chronic flooding if aggressive climate action is coupled with a muted response from land-based ice.</p>

<p>The prospect of these future losses necessitates action today. We must reorient policy and market forces toward solutions that work for people, ecosystems, coastal heritage, and the economy: by employing the best available science and information; by aligning existing policy and market incentives with the realities of sea level rise; and by investing in bold, transformative change that limits harm and fosters new frontiers of opportunity on safer ground.</p>

416,Barr Announces $1-Million Response to “Zero-Tolerance” Policies & Family Separations,"<p>Support combines $500,000 in grants from the Foundation with $500,000 in personal gifts from Barr’s founding trustees.</p>","<p>As we celebrate our nation’s independence this month, we would do well to remember the ideals enshrined in the Declaration of Independence in 1776:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>These sacred principles are now threatened by the so-called “zero-tolerance” policies being enforced along our nation’s southern borders. The tragic separation of family members, and the treatment of children—many under the age of 5—as though they were criminals, violate not only longstanding asylum laws, but basic human decency. And it is an assault upon the very values that define who we are as Americans.</p>

<p>While Barr is principally focused on New England, and immigration is not one of our core issues, we are nonetheless compelled to act out of shared humanity with the almost 3,000 children—by the Department of Health and Human Services’ own count—and their parents affected by these misguided policies.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Barr’s trustees approved <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/special-initiatives/strengthening-civil-rights-and-democracy"">a $3.5-million Special Initiative</a> to focus on civil rights protections for New England communities threatened by the current political and social environment and to ensure a fair and accurate 2020 Census count in New England. In May, <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/supporting-new-england-communities-under-threat-and-ensuring-a-fair-and-accurate-census-count"">we announced $2 million in grants as part of this initiative</a>, and we recently closed an open request for proposals for up to $1 million in additional grants that will be announced by the end of August.</p>

<p>At their quarterly meeting on June 20, Barr’s trustees authorized that the remaining $500,000 be dedicated to the family separation crisis. With gratitude for timely counsel from many of our funder colleagues and other leaders active on these issues, we are announcing today the following grants:</p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://www.domesticworkers.org"">National Domestic Workers Alliance, New York, NY</a></strong></p>

<p>$250,000 to support the End Family Separation Campaign, payable over 12 months.</p>

<p>The End Family Separation Campaign aims to end the federal administration’s “zero-tolerance” policy by engaging in grassroots mobilization activities and strategic communications efforts that share real stories of those affected by family separation.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://neophilanthropy.org"">NEO Philanthropy, New York, NY</a></strong></p>

<p>$200,000 to support the Four Freedoms Fund’s Rapid Response Fund, payable over 12 months.</p>

<p>The Four Freedoms Fund is a funder collaborative that will use Barr’s funds to support high-priority legal and other human services for children and parents affected by the border crisis.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://lawyerscom.org"">Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights, Boston, MA</a></strong></p>

<p>$50,000 to support services to reunite immigrant children with immigrant parents, payable over 12 months.</p>

<p>Barr’s support will enable the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights to provide legal support to families affected by separation policies. Funds will also assist in supporting partnerships with various community organizations that are supporting parents directly.</p>

<p>As Barr awards these three grants totaling $500,000, our founding trustees, Barbara and Amos Hostetter, have also committed personal gifts totaling $500,000 to the two national efforts outlined above, resulting in a total of $500,000 in support for the End Family Separation Campaign and $450,000 for the pooled fund at Four Freedoms Fund.</p>

<p>Last month, Barr joined with other foundations from across the country as co-signers of a statement issued by <a href=""https://www.gcir.org/family-separation-detention-statement#statement"">Grantmakers Concerned for Immigrants and Refugees</a>, which stated in part: “Together, we stand firm in shared values of fairness, compassion, and family integrity that underpin our work in philanthropy and our very identity as a nation.” With these commitments from Barr and our founding trustees, we add our actions to these words.</p>

<p>As a nation of immigrants with a proud tradition of welcoming those from all parts of the world, it is unconscionable that our country’s policies have created the unfolding tragedy at the border. While the primacy of strategic, focused philanthropy remains central to Barr’s work, we must also balance that focus with flexibility to take action when our values are threatened. This is such a moment, and we cannot sit idly by.</p>"
415,Barr Announces $4.5 million in New Grants for “Doing High School Differently”,<p>10 organizations from across New England gain support to plan and implement new school models to advance greater success for all students.</p>,"<p>Rooted in the belief that all young people can succeed in learning, work, and life, the Barr Foundation’s <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/education/engage-new-england"">Engage New England: Doing High School Differently initiative</a> is a $30-million, five-year investment to build innovative school models for students who are currently off track to graduate. Today it is our privilege to introduce the second of three cohorts of grantees under this initiative:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://cce.org/"">Center for Collaborative Education Metro Boston, Inc.</a>, Somerville, MA, for the redesign of the school model for Next Wave/Full Circle, a school in Somerville Public Schools.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.fallriverschools.org/"">Fall River Public Schools</a>, Fall River, MA, for the redesign of the school model for Resiliency Preparatory Academy.</li>
<li><a href=""https://www.hartfordschools.org/"">Hartford Public Schools</a>, Hartford, CT, for the design of a new program model in Hartford Public Schools. </li>
<li><a href=""http://phoenixcharteracademy.org/"">Phoenix Charter Academy Foundation, Inc.</a>, Lawrence, MA, for the redesign of the school model for Phoenix Charter Academy Lawrence, a regional school.</li>
<li><a href=""https://www.rwu.edu/"">Roger Williams University</a>, Providence, RI, for the design of a new school model, University High School, which targets students from the region.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these partners has been awarded $150,000 over one year to support planning for new, expanded, or improved schools. In addition, they will receive technical assistance and collective learning opportunities facilitated by <a href=""https://www.springpointschools.org/"">Springpoint</a>, our initiative partner. Springpoint will lead assessments of each organization&#39;s assets and needs and support them in articulating a vision and plan for the experiences they aspire to create for their students. Depending upon the quality of the resulting plans, participants may also be invited to apply for implementation grants of up to $750,000 over two years, to be awarded in 2019.</p>

<p>These five grantees represent a variety of approaches to advancing greater success for all students. They include concepts for both new schools and school redesigns. Hailing from Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, they also represent both traditional district, regional, and charter public schools.</p>

<p>Additionally, we are pleased to announce that $3,750,000 was awarded to five organizations that received planning support last year, as part of the first cohort of Engage New England: Doing High School Differently grantees. These implementation awards will support the launch of new, expanded, or improved schools in the fall of 2018, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.crec.org/"">Capital Region Education Council</a>, Hartford, CT, for the launch of Impact Academy.</li>
<li><a href=""https://www.chelseaschools.com/cps/"">Chelsea Public Schools</a>, Chelsea, MA, for the launch of Chelsea Opportunity Academy.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.msad60.org/"">Maine School Administrative District #60</a>, North Berwick, ME, for the launch of a redesigned and expanded Multiple Pathways Program at Noble High School.</li>
<li><a href=""https://themapacademy.org/"">Map Education, Inc.</a>, Plymouth, MA, for the launch of Map Academy, a new regional charter school.</li>
<li><a href=""http://phoenixcharteracademy.org/"">Phoenix Charter Academy Foundation</a>, Inc., Chelsea, MA, for the launch of a redesigned Phoenix Charter Academy Chelsea, a regional charter school.</li>
</ul>

<p>New England has done a good job for many students. Yet, we believe we can do a great job for all, by intentionally designing schools that align with the evidence of what works for all students: learning that places students at the center; is connected to higher education, employment, and civic life; and builds on students&#39; unique strengths, and those of their communities. Engage New England: Doing High School Differently invites partners to rethink high school education, aligning it with <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/what-is-positive-youth-development-in-high-schools"">positive youth development theory</a> and creating a variety of whole school models that are as rigorous as they are flexible in developing content knowledge, successful habits, creative know-how, and navigation abilities—the integrated knowledge and skills that students need to access their full potential, and to be successful in our rapidly-changing world.</p>

<p>While this initiative focuses on students who are most in need, we believe that what works for those who struggle most with our current, inflexible system will point the way to better opportunities for all secondary students.</p>

381,Twenty-Five New England Leaders Named Creative Community Fellows,"<p>New England has many talented artists and creative leaders whose work enlivens our communities and helps address social challenges. The Creative Community Fellows program creates a network of such leaders to foster collaboration, strengthen each other’s work, and deepen their impact.</p>","<p>National Arts Strategies (NAS) recently announced 25 creative change-makers to join our inaugural <a href=""http://www.artstrategies.org/programs/creative-community-fellows/"">Creative Community Fellows New England</a> cohort. Over the next six months, Fellows will work with NAS, faculty partners, mentors and each other over to build the skills and networks needed to push their projects forward. Their journey together will include two residential learning experiences and monthly online courses, with a curriculum focused on strategy, design thinking, and leadership.</p>

<p>The selection process was very competitive, with applications coming from every New England state – totaling over 115 proposals in all. The 25 Fellows selected bring a wide range of skills and knowledge to the cohort. Some have backgrounds in city planning. Others have experience with local business councils. All are united by their passion for arts and culture, and their belief in its potential to spur positive community change.</p>

<p>One of the common themes we noticed in Fellows’ projects was helping communities find ways to welcome newcomers. Anna Ackerman’s “World to Table” in Portland, Maine, for example, seeks to bring community members together to co-create meals in public spaces.  Workforce development also features prominently in this cohort, including Christopher Hope’s “Loop Lab” in Cambridge, Massachusetts and Ceilidh Galloway Kane’s “WonderArts Vermont” in the rural, northernmost corner of Vermont.</p>

380,"A Message to Mayors: To Lead on Climate, Focus on Transportation","<p>As mayors gather in Boston for an international summit on climate, Barr’s Mary Skelton Roberts makes the case for keeping mobility high on the agenda.</p>","<p>Today, global and national mayors will convene in Boston to advance shared solutions around climate change. By 2030, more than 60 percent of the world’s population will live in cities. Mayors will increasingly have more opportunity – and a deeper responsibility – to lead on climate change.</p>

<p>Boston has been a leader in planning for a future that will most certainly include higher tides, hotter days, and more extreme weather. Through Climate Ready Boston, the city has built a strong and comprehensive plan to manage growth, ensuring existing neighborhoods can thrive and new neighborhoods are ready for the changing climate.</p>

<p>Boston, like many other cities, has room to grow if it wants to mitigate the impacts of the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the US: the transportation sector. Luckily, transportation is one of the areas in which a mayor can have the greatest influence.</p>

<p>For example, Seattle <a href=""http://sdotblog.seattle.gov/2018/01/03/a-closer-look-at-seattles-rising-transit-ridership/"">has increased</a> its population by more than 15 percent since 2010 while  simultaneously reducing the number of commuters driving private vehicles downtown by 10 percent. How? By prioritizing transit, including dramatically improving bus service.</p>

<h3>Reprioritize city streets.</h3>
<p>Streets are one of the largest land assets cities own, but many mayors cede this precious space almost entirely to private car use. Car-centric street design sends the message that driving alone to work, school, and appointments is a city’s preferred transportation option for residents. Many cities are seeing major upticks in traffic congestion as a result.</p>

<p>Cities can make simple fixes like adding dedicated bus lanes during peak commuting hours to greatly improve transit reliability and enable more people to choose the bus over their car. Everett, here in Massachusetts, has been a pioneer around street priority, setting up a now-permanent “pop-up” dedicated bus lane on one of their main commuting throughways. Boston followed with a dedicated lane pilot in the Roslindale neighborhood, and the Barr Foundation is proud to be partnering with Everett, Arlington, Cambridge, and Watertown on other projects promoting better buses. The goal is to move the region closer to designing true bus rapid transit routes—the gold standard in moving people efficiently and effectively on local roads.</p>
<h3>Create better linkages between open spaces.</h3>
<p>Parks are a tried-and-true public health tool and will play an important role in resilience by reducing the “heat island effect” and mitigating climate change-induced flooding. Creating better linkages between park spaces takes driving out of the recreation equation. For example, <a href=""https://www.boston.gov/departments/transportation/boston-green-links"">Boston’s Green Links program</a> is a city-wide plan to connect people in every neighborhood to Boston’s greenway network by installing new walking and bike paths, and safer road crossings. Programs like this encourage people to walk and bike more (the original low- and no-carbon modes of transportation). Green spaces are also a key part of making cities more resilient in the face of extreme weather related to climate change.</p>
<h3>Promote greater density near transit.</h3>
<p>People in cities want to live near where they work and play. In Boston, we’ve heard this again and again from the major employers – including GE, Amazon, and Reebok – moving into our urban core. Mayors can attract new talent and new businesses by taking a close look at zoning policy near transit stations. Updating zoning can be a politically tough road, but building denser near transit encourages a city lifestyle that doesn’t require driving</p>
<h3>Accelerate regional mobility solutions.</h3>
<p>As we’ve seen with the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative around clean energy, states acting together are a force to be reckoned with. This multi-state effort has generated <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/northeast-carbon-markets-delivers-benefits-for-all"">roughly $4 billion in net benefits</a> to the region over nine years of implementation while reducing harmful emissions from power plants. Currently, 11 Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states (including Massachusetts) and the District of Columbia are working together on the Transportation and Climate Initiative (TCI) — a regional collaboration that seeks to improve transportation, develop the clean energy economy, and reduce carbon emissions from the transportation sector. Mayors in these states can and should show strong support for this effort to move forward — and regions across the country can learn from this collaborative and bi-partisan model.</p>

<p>Bringing mayors together to confront climate change is an enormous opportunity. Keeping transportation high on the agenda sets the stage for an impactful summit and ultimately cleaner, more livable cities everywhere.</p>

379,“Typical” Isn’t Good Enough,<p>We asked our grantees what it’s like to work with Barr. Here’s what we learned and what we’re doing about it.</p>,"<p>Last fall, Barr commissioned the Center for Effective Philanthropy (CEP) to conduct a Grantee Perception Report (GPR) – a confidential survey of our grantees about what it’s like to work with us. We also invited CEP to facilitate several focus groups, to help us understand our results better. As <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/value-of-constructive-feedback-in-philanthropy"">we promised when we launched the survey</a>, we are making our results public. In this post, we share our reflections on three key lessons and, more importantly, how we intend to respond.</p>

<p>At the Barr Foundation, we aim for excellence in every facet of our work. And we know that fulfilling that aspiration requires a healthy dose of humility and a willingness to ask for and listen attentively to feedback from those who know us best. The GPR has become an important tool for us to do that.</p>

<p>In the results we received, it was encouraging to see improvement on the strength of our grantee relationships, a priority for us since our last GPR in 2012. We also received high ratings in areas such as advancing knowledge, impact on public policy, and impact on organizations.  Nonetheless, in the end, as CEP reported to us, Barr’s overall ratings for grantee relationships are now similar to those of a “typical” funder.</p>

<p>We aspire to so much more than typical.</p>

<p>We know our effectiveness depends on quality relationships with our partners. Across the multiple relationship measures in the survey (our results on these are summarized in the chart below), we also saw wide variation among our programs. So, in addition to exploring opportunities to continue improving, part of our challenge is to identify the strong practices that exist and make them more consistent across the foundation. </p>

<p><img src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2434/original.png?1528727158"" alt=""Figure 1a""></p>
<h3>What we heard and what we’re going to do about it</h3>
<p>We have focused several staff conversations, our March Trustee meeting, and our May staff retreat on understanding our grantee feedback. Three lessons stood out for us, which we summarize below, along with our response:</p>
<h3>Lesson 1:</h3>
<p>Applying for and reporting on a Barr grant can be complex. And it isn’t always clear what we do with what we ask for.</p>
<h4>WHAT WE’LL DO:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>We’ll go through the process ourselves.</strong> This summer, as a staff, we will each go through the process of applying for a Barr Foundation grant. Our goal? To better understand what we ask grant seekers to do for us, where the process supports and adds value, and where it can be streamlined and improved - all with a more empathetic focus on the grant seeker experience.</li>
<li><strong>We won’t ask for what we don’t use.</strong> For our application and reporting processes, our new standard will be: if we won’t use it, we won’t ask for it. One of the refrains that resonated at our recent staff retreat was “people, not paper.” Rather than transactional relationships, our aim is to cultivate relationships rooted in mutual respect, trust, candor, and support. </li>
<li><strong>If we ask our grantees to spend time on something, they’ll know we are too.</strong> We received very low ratings on the usefulness of Barr’s reporting and evaluation practices. With Yvonne Belanger joining us as Director of Learning &amp; Evaluation last fall, we have already been working to improve these areas–with an eye towards making them more collaborative and beneficial to our partners. Soon, we will also launch a new Learning &amp; Evaluation section of our website.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lesson 2:</h3>
<p>Grantees reported that Barr staff are accessible and highly engaged throughout the application process. But after a grant has been awarded, the line can go quiet. Some find it difficult to get a response. Some feel uncertain what to do when challenges arise. This contributes to uncertainty (and sometimes anxiety) about what Barr’s priorities are and where things stand.</p>
<h4>WHAT WE’LL DO:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>We’ll be clear about what to expect.</strong> We will communicate more clearly how we plan to engage with our partners during every phase of the relationship. We will work to establish expectations at the outset about how often, and about what topics grantees can expect to hear from us. Just as importantly, we will clarify how often, and about what range of topics we want to hear from them.</li>
<li><strong>We’ll keep the lines of communication open.</strong> While many grantees described feeling they could always reach us to share challenges, opportunities, or ideas, others weren’t so sure. We’ll work to establish this norm more consistently across all of our grantee relationships.</li>
<li><strong>When partners reach out, we’ll reply in a timely manner.</strong> On average, Barr’s program staff each manage 49 grantee relationships, alongside their active engagement in the field, which is an important part of the job. We are all busy. Yet, there is never an excuse for not responding to messages. Even if we can’t provide a thoughtful, substantive response right away, we won’t leave partners wondering if we got the message. We will commit to replying in a timely manner, and letting folks know when and how we can connect.</li>
<li><strong>We’ll strive to be clearer about what our priorities are, how our partners fit, and who else we’re funding.</strong> We will work to clarify, both on our website and through conversations with grantees, the goals of our strategies, how our grants align with those strategies, and how the work of our partners relates to that of other organizations we support. We will also consider how we can convene grantees with greater frequency (and clear purpose) to help deepen relationships, improve communications, and enhance outcomes for all.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lesson 3:</h3>
<p>Our processes can sometimes feel inflexible.</p>
<h4>WHAT WE’LL DO:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimize restrictions.</strong> We know grantees greatly value flexible support. We will continue providing multi-year, general operating support when we are able to. In cases where unrestricted support may not be possible, we recognize the strong preference for support that is less restrictive in nature. And we commit to developing those parameters in an open and collaborative manner with our partners.</li>
<li><strong>Maximize flexibility and customization.</strong> We are committed to making our proposal and reporting processes more flexible and customized. A request to renew a general operating support grant should be much more streamlined than a first-time request for project support, for example. We will strive to be responsive to partners’ work flow and needs (not driven solely by Barr’s calendar and requirements). In some cases, we will also accept proposals and reports developed for other funders (as we have already begun to do with some of our special initiative grantmaking). </li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Opportunities for Improvement</h3>
<p>Though these three issues will be our primary concern in the months ahead, we will also work to respond to other areas of feedback. For instance, we will explore how to be more active and present in the communities we aim to serve – as many partners noted that increased engagement by Barr would be beneficial. Our partners were also interested in learning more about our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. And we will have more to share on that topic later this year. </p>

<h3>Reporting Back on Our Progress</h3>
<p>Recently, it has become common practice for foundations to make their GPR results public and outline steps they will take as a result. We share that commitment, of course.
In addition, we plan to report publicly on our progress toward the steps outlined above. This summer, on the Learning &amp; Evaluation page of our website, we will create a dedicated space related to the GPR. It will include the various results we have linked to here, the steps we have committed to take (including those outlined above, as well as others still to be identified), and updates on our progress in real-time. This is an experiment for us, to hold ourselves accountable to action, to ensure we follow through on the many good suggestions we received, and to demonstrate how foundations can strive for greater accountability.</p>
<h3>Gratitude</h3>
<p>We are grateful to the over 200 grantees who participated in our 2017 GPR. We are also enormously thankful for the excellent work of the CEP team, including Kevin Bolduc, Della Menhaj, and Naomi Orensten. They didn’t simply issue a survey, gather results, and hand them over; they truly invested in getting to know the data in-depth, and helping us understand the implications and the possibilities for doing better.
Not all of our grantees shared the same concerns we focused on here. We received lots of positive feedback as well. Yet, we are not satisfied if even some partners have a middling or negative experience with us. It is clear our grantees want more than a transactional relationship with us. We want that too. And, we know how important it is to get this right. 
At the opening of our staff retreat this year, Jim shared this quote, by Alan Pifer, who, in 1973 as president of the Carnegie Corporation of New York, wrote the following in his annual report essay:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Above all other aspects of foundation work, I would put the human factor. I mean by this the attitudes and behavior of foundation staff members. If they are arrogant, self-important, dogmatic, conscious of power and status, or filled with a sense of their own omniscience—traits which the stewardship of money tends to bring out in some people—the foundation they serve cannot be a good one.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, they have genuine humility, are conscious of their own limitations, are aware that money does not confer wisdom, are humane, intellectually alive and curious people, ¬men and women who above all else are eager to learn from others—the foundation they serve will probably be a good one.</p>

<p>In short, the human qualities of its staff may in the end be far more important to what a foundation accomplishes than any other consideration.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many factors contribute to a foundation’s effectiveness and impact. Yet, few are as important as the human factor. This is as true today as it was when Pifer wrote it 45 years ago. It is the standard to which we intend to hold ourselves. And we invite you to do the same.</p>

377,Supporting New England Communities Under Threat and Ensuring a Fair and Accurate 2020 Census Count,"<p>Barr announces $3-million expansion of 2017 Special Initiative, including an open request for proposals to fund efforts throughout New England.</p>","<p>At the heart of the Barr Foundation’s mission is the concept of “investing in potential.” This includes efforts to deepen and expand potential, as well as to address barriers that inhibit people and communities from realizing their full potential. As a consequence of the policies, priorities, and rhetoric emanating from Washington, many of our fellow Americans have been targeted and marginalized. This is beyond unacceptable, and it merits a concerted response.</p>

<p>Barr has decided to extend a Special Initiative launched last year to address similar concerns. In 2017, Barr <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/special-initiatives/strengthening-civil-rights-and-democracy#2017-grantmaking"">awarded more than $3 million</a> to support investigative journalism and frontline organizations promoting and protecting civil rights in New England communities—especially for immigrants and refugees, Muslims, communities of color, and LGBTQ people. Such organizations were experiencing an unprecedented surge in demand for their services. Unfortunately that need has not abated. In fact, it has grown.</p>

<p>At the same time, the country is preparing for the next decennial census in 2020. This key element of our representative democracy is also a critical data source for decision-making and resource allocations in the public, nonprofit, and business sectors. Communities and advocates are already organizing to counter systemic barriers that have historically led to undercounting people of color, immigrants, young children, and poor people—injustices exacerbated now by underinvestment, untested changes in the process, and fear of government that federal actions and rhetoric continue to fuel.</p>

<p>And so, <strong>the Barr Foundation is making a second $3-million commitment to <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/special-initiatives/strengthening-civil-rights-and-democracy"">a 2018 Special Initiative</a> to expand this critical work</strong>, focusing on two priorities informed by our partners and what we learned during our first year.</p>

<p>Today we are announcing $2 million in grants to the following leading organizations advancing these priorities, as well as a request for proposals:</p>
<h4>Priority One: Support civil rights protections for communities in New England threatened by the current political and social environment</h4>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><a href=""http://www.cpresente.org"">Centro Presente</a></strong><br>
$200,000 to provide core support, payable over 24 months</p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://www.thelennyzakimfund.org"">The Lenny Zakim Fund</a></strong><br>
$300,000 to provide financial support and technical assistance to grassroots organizations addressing social and economic injustice, payable over 36 months</p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://mlac.org"">Massachusetts Legal Assistance Corporation (MLAC)</a></strong><br>
$200,000 to support the <a href=""http://mlac.org/initiatives/immigrantdefensefund"">Greater Boston Immigrant Defense Fund</a>, payable over 24 months</p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://www.muslimjusticeleague.org"">Muslim Justice League</a></strong><br>

<p><strong><a href=""http://tsne.org"">TSNE MissionWorks</a></strong><br>
$150,000 to support the <a href=""https://csioboston.weebly.com"">Center to Support Immigrant Organizing</a>, payable over 36 months</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Priority Two: Ensure a fair and accurate 2020 Census count in New England</h4>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><a href=""https://www.philanthropyma.org/"">Philanthropy Massachusetts</a></strong><br>
$400,000 to support the <a href=""http://agmconnect.org/node/58660"">Massachusetts Census Equity Fund 2020</a>, payable over 24 months</p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://leadershipconferenceedfund.org"">Leadership Conference Education Fund</a></strong><br>

<p><strong><a href=""http://massvote.org"">MassVOTE</a></strong><br>
$200,000 to support 2020 Census education and outreach, payable over 24 months</p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://www.newventurefund.org"">New Venture Fund</a></strong><br>
$200,000 to support the Census 2020 Project, payable over 24 months</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As with our Special Initiative grants last year, these grants consist of multi-year general operating support to provide maximum flexibility to our partners, to ensure stability during this time of change, and to help organizations meet increased demand for their services and engagement.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--consist""> <p>grants</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>In addition to awarding this set of grants, <strong>Barr is launching a New England Civil Rights Fund, and we are inviting organizations to apply for funding through an open Request for Proposals (RFP).</strong> We are issuing this open RFP to ensure that organizations beyond our current networks have an opportunity to introduce themselves to us. Recognizing that fewer philanthropic resources tend to be available outside larger metropolitan regions such as Boston, grants from the Fund will prioritize work beyond Greater Boston.</p>

<p>The New England Civil Rights Fund will provide up to $1 million in grant commitments this year. The <a href=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/213/attachments/Barr_Fdn_New_England_Civil_Rights_Fund_RFP.pdf?1527626673"">full RFP is available here</a>. Proposals are due on July 2.</p>

<p>A perennial challenge in philanthropy is balancing staying power on long-term priorities with sufficient flexibility to adjust to shifting circumstances. Barr’s enduring focus is on Arts &amp; Creativity, Climate, and Education, and we remain committed to that core work. Yet, when our neighbors are under attack, and when policies fuel discrimination and marginalization, we cannot sit idly by.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--neighbors""> <p>our</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Though we realize these resources and Barr’s role are limited, we also know that the times demand we all step up, speak out, and push back for what is right and just.</p>

<p>Last August, the Barr Foundation was pleased to partner with the Boston Public Schools (BPS) on an important new study commissioned by Superintendent Tommy Chang. Its purpose was to provide a comprehensive analysis of the District’s secondary schools, with a focus on students who have fallen off track to graduate.</p>

<p>With funding from Barr, BPS engaged EY-Parthenon to lead a deep, thorough analysis of students in its high schools, the paths students take, and the school, system and policy factors that contribute to students falling off-track to graduate. EY-Parthenon analyzed data on all students in grades 6 – 12 who enrolled in BPS between the 2009-10 and 2016-17 school years. They also conducted focus groups with current high school students. Throughout the process, they worked closely with a steering committee comprised of leadership from BPS high schools and from the District’s central office.</p>

<p>The resulting report, <em><a href=""https://barrfdn.issuelab.org/resource/excellence-and-equity-for-all-unlocking-opportunities-for-off-track-youth-in-boston-public-schools.html"">Excellence and equity for all — Unlocking opportunities for off-track youth in Boston Public Schools</a></em>, identified some sobering statistics about the opportunities and challenges young people face within the current system, including:</p>
<h3>Too many students are enrolled in high schools they and their families did not choose.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Many students are assigned to schools they have not chosen as a means of filling seats in under-enrolled schools.</li>
<li>High school student enrollment has declined by ~2,500 over the last decade, while the number of high school seats has increased by ~400, allowing schools to be under-enrolled.

<li>Most of these assignments are made to the city’s open enrollment schools, the schools in the city with the lowest level of performance. Exam schools and selective admission schools fill first. </li>
</ul>
<h3>All students do not enjoy equal access to high-quality schools.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Due to policy and process decisions made regarding student assignment, there is a wide range of expected graduation rates across the district’s high schools (94% - 56%).</li>
<li>Students do not have equal access to schools that provide a higher likelihood of success.

</ul>
<h3>Nearly one in five high school students are falling off track, and existing supports for them are inadequate to the challenges they face in connecting to success.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Even though graduation rates have increased and drop-out rates have decreased, thousands of high school students (18%) fall more than two years off track to high school graduation, and this number has improved only marginally in the last ten years.</li>
<li>Once a student falls off track, their chances of graduating dramatically decrease. Among students who seek other options outside of traditional high schools, many fail to secure a placement, and those who do enroll in non-traditional high schools do not experience any greater rate of success than if they had remained in traditional settings.</li>

<p>The challenges facing BPS’ high schools are the result of many decisions made over many years. Addressing these challenges will require bold and comprehensive action, and engagement from the entire community, including philanthropy. Behind the statistics in this report are real young people whose lives are profoundly impacted and we must act urgently to ensure excellence is available to all.</p>"
375,"Far From the Day-to-Day, Boston Leaders Reflect, Connect",<p>Members of the 2017 class of Barr Fellows share about their ten-day learning journey to Rwanda.</p>,"<p><em>Pictured above: Class of 2017 Barr Fellows at the Nyamirambo Women’s Center.</em></p>

<p>Since the launch of its inaugural class in 2005, the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/fellows"">Barr Fellowship</a> has recognized exceptional social sector leaders from Greater Boston, investing in their professional development, and in the development of their senior management and rising leaders within their organizations. Since those earliest years, Barr Fellows have collaborated to bring new resources and opportunity to their communities in varied and creative ways. And, even as some Fellows have been called into leadership roles with new organizations, or within City and State government, they have remained deeply connected and supportive of each other.</p>

<p>As an intentional investment to build that deep level of trust and connection, the Barr Fellowship experience begins with a ten-day group learning journey outside the United States. Each journey is carefully designed to immerse Fellows in a collective, challenging growth experience; build deep relationships among Fellows; and offer inspiration through exchanges with leaders working in another country.</p>

<p>For their learning journey, the 2017 class of Barr Fellows traveled earlier this year to Rwanda, a country that has been taking on the hard work of collective healing and significant community rebuilding since the 1994 Genocide. We invited several Barr Fellows to reflect on the experience – in particular the impact on them of traveling to such a distant place with other travelers they didn’t really know.</p>

<p><strong>Ayele Shakur (BUILD Greater Boston)</strong>: “Part of what made the learning journey to Rwanda so impactful was the amazing group of nonprofit leaders that I was traveling with. We boarded the plane in Boston as strangers, but returned 12 days later as lifelong friends.”</p>

<p><strong>Colby Swettberg (Silver Lining Mentoring)</strong>: “The learning journey was an opportunity for each of us to show up and dig deep into what matters most in our leadership, in our communities, and in cultures that extend across the globe. We couldn’t keep ourselves from making connections back to our organizations and openly sharing challenges and solutions in the service of supporting one another. It would have taken many years to create the bonds that grew organically from our learning journey – I’m confident that we’ll rely on one another in myriad ways personally and professionally in the years to come as a result of having shared this experience.”</p>

<p><strong>Yusufi Vali (Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center)</strong>: “The learning journey gave me significant perspective on my work. There is a bigger world out there, and there is amazing work to learn from. I have come back committed to getting beyond the narrow world of my organization. It also gave me great perspective on how a country so torn apart can come together. It helped me understand how important leadership is to building culture, and that realization helped me reflect a lot on my leadership and how it is shaping culture in my organization in positive and negative ways.”</p>

<p><strong>Chaplain Clementina Chery (Louis D. Brown Peace Institute)</strong>: “The whole experience reminded me that, as a leader, the best way to lead is to trust that others can lead when the time is right. We are all leaders in our own way and in our own time.”</p>

<p>The learning journey is an important element of the Barr Fellowship model. Stepping far away from the day-to-day responsibilities of civic leadership provides an opportunity for professional growth and reflection that could not happen at home. In addition, the “who” of the learning journey is just as important as the “where, what and why.” Barr strives for each class to include a diverse group of leaders from organizations of different types that are working in multiple fields and communities. Fellows learn just as much from each other as they do from the intense itinerary planned to help them learn about the destination. </p>

374,Young Minds Open to the Sounds of Their City ,<p>Fourth in a new series featuring stories from Greater Boston arts organizations that received special funding to pursue an artistic risk.</p>,"<p><em>The arts are always about taking risks. But funding for risk taking is often hard to come by. With new resources dedicated to artistic risk, seven organizations pushed themselves beyond their comfort zones. This story of what happened comes from Nick Tetrault, Music Clubhouse Coordinator at the West End House Boys and Girls Club.</em></p>

<p><div class=""Media -full""> <div class=""u-fluid-iframe""> <div class=""u-fluid-iframe-inner""> <iframe src=""//player.vimeo.com/video/268999486?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0"" title=""Featured Video"" frameborder=""0"" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen loading=""lazy""> <a href=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/268999486?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0"">A video on Vimeo</a> </iframe> </div> </div> </div></p>

<p>When organizations like ours are looking for arts funding, it is easy to go with what is safe. For the Music Clubhouse at the West End House Boys and Girls Club in Boston, pianos are safe. So are guitars. Kids take lessons. Their parents like that they are learning an instrument. Kids put up with regular lessons because it makes their parents happy and they like the piano or the guitar. And, while there is nothing wrong with kids learning artistic skills they enjoy and are proud of, there is so much more we can do to activate their own creativity.</p>

<p>Our kids think of themselves as artists. That is something I work to encourage in them every day. When we had the opportunity to take a risk with funding from the Barr Foundation and Klarman Family Foundation, we wanted to show our kids that music is everywhere. We gave them audio recorders, headphones, and iPads. I challenged them to listen to their city. We watched the way their perception of the world around them changed as every object was now a potential sound source—the traffic on the streets, a metal light pole, the water rushing down a fountain. They discovered what they could do to manipulate these sounds, combine it with other sounds, and create beats from the sounds of their city. They were creating art and loving it. Being a part of that discovery process is one of the most rewarding parts of this work.</p>

<p>This kind of art is its own risk. You never know how the final product will turn out. But the bigger risk for us was putting time and resources into a program that might not capture the kids’ attention. We are a drop-in program. On any given day, our kids can show up or not show up. So, to go deep with a group of kids, our programming has to capture their imagination, engage their curiosity, and inspire commitment to themselves and to our program.</p>

<p>What became clear for us through this project is, what you lose with safety you can gain in risk. If we are trying new things, we are gaining insights that are invaluable, that could be applied across all our curriculum and programming.</p>

<p>Our kids take a risk every day when they allow themselves to explore new possibilities. We owe it to them to provide those adventures. In the truest sense, that is youth development.</p>

<p>We invite you to share this story of artistic risk-taking, and to join the conversation using <a href=""https://twitter.com/search?q=%23artisticrisk&src=typd"">#ArtisticRisk</a>.</p>
<h3>About the Barr-Klarman Arts Capacity Building Initiative and this video series:</h3>
<p>The Barr-Klarman Arts Capacity Building Initiative was a five-year initiative to strengthen the long term financial health of a group of Boston area arts organizations. Throughout the Initiative, the partners grappled with the question: capitalization to what end? What’s the desired change for the organization and for our communities? First, the cohort explored what organizational risks could look like, and the kinds of capital needed. And in the last two years, the partners asked what taking risks in the art and curation looked like, and what kinds of support are needed for risk-taking. A fund was set up as part of the Initiative, with the goal of supporting projects that took organizations out of the comfort zone of their usual practice, potentially against standard field practice, and with the potential to change their organizational way of working.</p>

<p>These commissioned videos document the journey of the seven projects that were funded. Each video centers on one organization and, through the eyes of its leaders, gives a glimpse into their journey of artistic risk-taking. We hope that these leaders and projects will engage you in a conversation that deepens understanding and builds support for this exciting kind of work.</p>"
373,Northeast Carbon Market Keeps Delivering Major Benefits to All ,<p>New report details sustained economic and environmental gains enjoyed by states participating in regional carbon cap-and-trade market.</p>,"<p>The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, known as RGGI, continues to succeed at reducing pollution, creating jobs, and boosting economies for all participating states. It’s no wonder that Virginia will soon add its name to the RGGI states, New Jersey is in the process of rejoining, and that states are exploring ways to reap the benefits of carbon markets to drive investments in transit and cleaner mobility options. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.analysisgroup.com/uploadedfiles/content/insights/publishing/analysis_group_rggi_report_april_2018.pdf"">A new report released last month by the Analysis Group</a> found that, over the past three years, RGGI helped grow participating states’ economies by $1.4 billion, while adding 14,500 job-years (equivalent to full-time jobs for one year of employment).  Nine states participate in RGGI, including the six New England states plus New York, Delaware, and Maryland. Key findings from the report are detailed in the infographic below.</p>

<p><img src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2377/original.png?1525796361"" alt=""Figure 1""> </p>

<p>RGGI is a cap and trade program; it requires energy producers that emit carbon dioxide to buy pollution allowances through an auction process.  This means that they must internalize some of the costs of carbon pollution related to fossil fuels. It also incentivizes investment in cleaner fuel sources.</p>

<p>Altogether, since the program was implemented in 2009, the nine RGGI states have collected $2.8 billion in auction proceeds. States typically use RGGI auction revenues to pay for energy efficiency and clean energy programs – a “cap-and-invest” approach that further cuts emissions, reduces energy costs, and creates jobs. When states invest RGGI proceeds in energy efficiency, they get the biggest “bang for the buck” as they add more businesses and jobs in activities such as energy audits and installing energy-efficiency equipment. RGGI also helped reduce by $1.37 billion the amount of money sent out of the region to import fossil fuels.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--wonder""> <p>no</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Looking back over nearly a decade of the RGGI program implementation, carbon dioxide emissions from power plants have been cut in half. Net economic benefits have totaled $4 billion, and the region has created over 44,000 new job-years.</p>

<p>Strong action on carbon pollution has also benefited consumers. Over the life of the RGGI program, consumers have seen a net savings of $220 million in energy costs across the region. These savings are in addition to the economic benefits that we all receive as members of the local economies in RGGI states where the auction proceeds are spent.</p>

<p>RGGI has proven that it is possible to significantly reduce carbon emissions in ways that provide significant and sustained economic benefits. It is also a great example of how, in the absence of national leadership, states can work together to continue to make meaningful forward progress on climate. With the additions of Virginia and New Jersey, the combined economic output of RGGI states would rise to $3.9 trillion, making it the fourth largest economy in the world.</p>

<p>The Barr Foundation is proud to join other funders in our support for RGGI, including support for independent research to assess its impacts, and for efforts to facilitate new states joining the RGGI market.</p>

372,Five Lessons from Two Decades of Early Education Grantmaking,<p>Senior Program Officer Kimberly Haskins reflects on nearly 20 years of work focused on improving outcomes for Massachusetts’ youngest learners.</p>,"<p>I’ve had the privilege to work in philanthropy for two decades, and for almost 15 of those years, I managed Barr Foundation’s early education portfolio. This has included longstanding commitments and short-term exploratory grants; some deep partnerships; patient work and impatient prodding; strategies that evolved with our learning; and steady progress.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago, the field was largely focused on increasing access to childcare. Over time, that focus has both shifted and expanded to include not only increasing supply, but enhancing quality in early care and education. That shift in focus has also increased attention to outcomes for children.</p>

<p>As we have now made our final Early Education grant commitments, I’ve been reflecting on my years guiding this portfolio, supporting partners to elevate the quality of early education in Boston and Massachusetts, with a constant focus on what works best for children. This post is my effort to distill a few key learnings – and to introduce a <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/early-education"">new, dedicated page on Barr’s website</a> describing our goals and strategies and, importantly, featuring the work of some of our outstanding nonprofit partners.</p>
<h3>Five Lessons Learned to Promote High-Quality Early Education</h3><h4>1. The early education workforce must be highly skilled and fairly compensated.</h4>
<p>To get great results—meaning more children benefit from great early learning opportunities—early education professionals must be prepared to make the most of every exchange with a child. While the skill and experience of the educator is a primary determinant of program quality, wages in the field make it hard to attract and retain the most qualified individuals. In Massachusetts, the average salary for a community-based early education teacher is <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes252012.htm#st"">$29,020 per year</a>.  In comparison, the average salary of a kindergarten teacher in the State is <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes399011.htm#st"">$71,790 per year</a>. This compensation gap means that many early educators are not receiving a wage that is livable, given the cost of housing and other expenses in Massachusetts. While recent data is not available, it’s estimated that the turnover rate of educators in community-based centers may be as high as 30% in communities <a href=""https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED500758.pdf"">across the State</a>.  Without a highly-skilled, appropriately compensated workforce, children are less likely to get the thoughtful interactions they need at a time when their brain architecture is most rapidly developing.</p>
<h4>2. Curriculum matters and supports should be scaffolded to increase effective instruction and child learning.</h4>
<p>Early educators need an evidence-based curriculum to best engage in the intentional, stimulating interaction that supports healthy child development and strong vocabularies (what experts refer to as <a href=""https://developingchild.harvard.edu/science/key-concepts/serve-and-return/"">“serve and return” interactions</a>). Importantly, that curriculum should include a focus on language development and early literacy as well as numeracy, as early math skills not only predict later success in math, but also future reading achievement. Importantly, research indicates that programs focusing on strong literacy are more likely to consider the development of the whole child so that social and emotional development are also supported. Educators not only need high-quality curricula, they need regular professional development to use it and coaching to strengthen their instruction. Importantly, these supports cannot be “one and done,” they must be scaffolded, intentionally sequenced with periodic updates to build and sustain effective instructional practice, including the capacity to adapt to meet the needs of individual learners. We’ve seen this in action at Boston Public Schools when the district adopted “Opening the World to Learning” and “Building Blocks” curricula and became one of the most effective public early childhood programs in the country.</p>
<h4>3. Data must be available to understand children’s development and to improve programs.</h4>
<p>Investments in quality are important, but if we don’t invest in the data to understand the impact on children, those investments may be wasted. Data and assessment are important tools to understand how children are progressing and, if there are delays, provide an important opportunity to adjust programming and connect children and families to resources. <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/partners/boston-public-schools-and-boston-k1ds"">BPS regularly contracted external assessments</a> as it expanded Pre-K access while implementing evidence-based curricula to ensure those seats were high quality. Similarly, independent program assessment can help cities and states make decisions about technical assistance, funding, and the other supports necessary to achieve goals for children. Barr’s <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/partners/charting-a-course-to-universal-high-quality-pre-k"">grant to the United Way of Massachusetts Bay and Merrimack Valley</a> helped the City of Boston plan intentionally for high-quality Pre-K for all early learners. </p>
<h4>4. Great teaching can happen almost anywhere, but developmentally appropriate facilities are better for children and their teachers.</h4>
<p>Some teachers seem like miracle workers who could work their wonders in a parking lot or a cardboard box, if they had to. But quickly converted storefronts and basements are not usually ideal environments for young children or their teachers. Research by the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/partners/children-s-investment-fund"">Children’s Investment Fund</a> found that financially strapped early childhood programs don’t have the resources for basic maintenance, let alone improvements. In the worst instances, facilities can do harm, as when poor heating and ventilation systems contribute to poor air quality, and possibly trigger asthma. Research has shown that it matters a great deal when children have high-quality places to learn. Developmentally appropriate facilities can help attract and retain top teaching talent and can contribute to improved student outcomes. Importantly, the Fund’s research prompted Massachusetts legislators to pass and continue to fund a bond bill that provides up to $45 million over five years for an Early Education and Out of School Time Capital Fund to improve program facilities across the State.</p>
<h4>5. Policy investments are critical.</h4>
<p>While investment in program quality is essential to improve the educational experience of the children in those programs today, longer term change to improve the experience for all children requires effective systems supported by research, policy, and public education. Organizations that can understand what families need, translate that information into sound policy, and serve as independent watch dogs to monitor implementation are critical components to any healthy system. For example, in Massachusetts, <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/partners/strategies-for-children"">Strategies for Children</a> has been a stalwart advocate for sound early childhood policies with appropriate funding to support effective practice. The organization was instrumental in making the case that prompted Massachusetts legislators to establish the Department of Early Education and Care, and it serves as a “critical friend” as the agency supports the healthy development of children across the Commonwealth. Similarly, as described above, the Children’s Investment Fund launched a facilities inventory project that helped make the case for public dollars for capital projects.</p>

<p>In addition, these examples underscore the importance of public-private partnerships. While philanthropy brings significant resources, its contributions are dwarfed by public investments in our communities. Working in partnership, each plays a critical role. Philanthropy can provide timely and flexible resources essential to seed and test new ideas, establish proof points, disseminate evidence of what works (and what doesn’t), and invest in planning to bring good ideas to scale – which, in turn, depends on the wise deployment of public dollars.</p>

<p>While the field has made significant improvements over the last two decades, there are some things that remain constant— like the fact that all children are born learning. However, they progress at different paces based on opportunity. It is the back and forth interaction between children and adults that support children’s healthy development. Since families are the first and most important teachers for children, parents and other caregivers must feel confident in that role. In addition, working families often rely on early education and care professionals, and that workforce works best when supported in an effective system that places children and their healthy development at the center of all decisions.</p>

<p>None of these examples of learning and impact would have been possible without the leadership and wisdom of the nonprofits and other funding partners that I have had the privilege to work with these many years. The Barr team is grateful for their commitment, candor, and partnership. And we are honored to feature some of their important work in this new site.</p>

371,From Platform to Presenter: How Boston Center for the Arts Reconnected to its Founding Mission,<p>Third in a new series featuring stories from Greater Boston arts organizations that received special funding to pursue an artistic risk.</p>,"<p><em>The Arts are always about taking risks. But funding for risk-taking is often hard to come by. With new resources dedicated to artistic risk, seven organizations pushed themselves beyond their comfort zones. This story of what happened comes from Boston Center for the Arts’ Chief Advancement Officer, Emily Foster Day.</em></p>

<p>The Cyclorama has always been the crown jewel of our 500+ acre campus in the South End. There is no building quite like it. The brick floor, copper dome and skylight make for a stunning venue – if also a notoriously challenging one for artists. The acoustics are tricky. Lighting the space is a challenge. It’s an odd, unusual, interesting room. Its unique features have drawn individuals and organizations to use it as an event space for years. That is also what has made it a key revenue generator for the Boston Center for the Arts (BCA).</p>

<p>When it was designed and constructed in the 1880s, the purpose of the Cyclorama was to serve as a showcase for visual and performing arts. Exhibiting art fulfills our mission to support the creation, performance, and display of new artwork in new ways for new audiences, connecting arts to community. Yet, the majority of our programming in the space has not actually been arts-related. As an arts organization, the irony of the relative lack of art in the Cyclorama was never lost on us, and we were working to change this model.</p>

<p>When the opportunity came to use this grant to take an artistic risk, the challenges presented by the space became opportunities to activate the Cyclorama like never before. And thanks to the grant funds, we could welcome an artist to the space without the temptation of a rental client diverting our plans. Our Director of Visual Arts, Randi Hopkins, thought of Maria Finkelmeier, Ryan Edwards, Sam Okerstrom-Lang and their collective, <a href=""http://www.masarystudios.com/"">Masary Studios</a>, who are known for major, large scale, site-specific performances using sound, light, movement, and video to create a work that could directly respond to the unique architecture of the Cyclorama.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--opportunity""> <p>the</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>The performance piece they created, Know No., unveiled itself literally around the audience, who moved about the space as the artists performed among them. It was a unique experience of sound and light, imagery and percussion, choreography and spoken word. We had never seen anything like it, and as a result, weren’t entirely sure who the audience for it would be. We had no idea what to expect when we began promoting the show. Not only was this a new experience for the BCA and its audiences. It also did not fit neatly into a genre that we could easily market to. </p>

<p>We took a risk commissioning an installation in a space notoriously challenging for performances, creating something we weren’t sure we had an audience for, and potentially losing out on earned income to support our programs. But this process gave us permission to change the DNA of Boston Center for the Arts and we could not be more satisfied with the results.</p>

<h3>About the Barr-Klarman Arts Capacity Building Initiative and this video series:</h3>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/arts-creativity/barr-klarman-arts-capacity-building"">Barr-Klarman Arts Capacity Building Initiative</a> was a five-year initiative to strengthen the long term financial health of a group of Boston area arts organizations. Throughout the Initiative, the partners grappled with the question: capitalization to what end? What’s the desired change for the organization and for our communities? First, the cohort explored what organizational risks could look like, and the kinds of capital needed. And in the last two years, the partners asked what taking risks in the art and curation looked like, and what kinds of support are needed for risk-taking. A fund was set up as part of the Initiative, with the goal of supporting projects that took organizations out of the comfort zone of their usual practice, potentially against standard field practice, and with the potential to change their organizational way of working.</p>

<p>These commissioned videos document the journey of the seven projects that were funded. Each centers on one organization and, through the eyes of its leaders, gives a glimpse into one journey of artistic risk-taking. We hope that these leaders and projects will engage you a conversation that deepens understanding and builds support for this exciting kind of work.</p>"
370,Health Care's Role in Anchoring Community Health and Resilience,<p>Second in a blog series on climate resilience and health care.</p>,"<p><em>Pictured above: Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital&#39;s waterfront landscaping beautifully integrates historic granite storm surge barriers, elevated therapy trails and a park for area residents.</em></p>

<p>As critical service providers and the largest employers in metro Boston and statewide, the health care sector is uniquely positioned to support the health and resilience of our communities in a world facing increasing climate disruption.  But recent extreme weather events have exposed the frailty and deep interdependence of our infrastructure systems, and proven health facilities must take care of themselves AND act as anchor institutions to sustain their communities.</p>

<p>In an <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/leadership-in-the-storm"">earlier blog</a>, we explored some of the ways climate change is impacting the health care sector, and smart actions leading hospitals are taking to limit their vulnerability. This second part looks beyond how hospitals can protect themselves to the important leadership roles they can play in broader community efforts. It summarizes key findings from a recent summit and report, &quot;Resilience 2.0: Health Care’s Role in Anchoring Community Health and Resilience,&quot; by Health Care Without Harm, with sponsorship support from the Barr Foundation and co-hosted by HCWH and Partners HealthCare. </p>

<p>The Resilience 2.0 Summit and report engaged over 110 leaders from metro Boston hospitals, municipalities, utilities, state and federal agencies in asking, &quot;How can we re-imagine how we fulfill our missions to address climate&#39;s threats? How can we anchor community level prevention and resilience?&quot; Participants:</p>

<ul>
<li>Shared the latest thinking on climate change impacts on health care facilities and our region&#39;s infrastructure</li>
<li>Updated each other on the region&#39;s many interconnected climate resiliency initiatives </li>
<li>Created a network of organizations and champions who recognize each other, know what each other is doing, and can explore how best to provide mutual, complementary support</li>
<li>Recommended critical next steps</li>
<li>Raised many difficult strategic questions, and sparked pilot projects to test solutions.</li>

<p><img src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2306/original.jpg?1524250853"" alt=""Figure 1""> </p>

<p>The central question throughout the summit was, &quot;What is health care’s role in anchoring community/public health and resilience, especially for socially vulnerable populations, which are usually disproportionately harmed by severe weather?&quot; By collaborating with neighborhoods to strengthen support for children, elders, those with medical illness, people of color, and others—as mapped for Boston in Figure 1—we can help to significantly improve both quality of life and climate resilience. Both the Summit and the report led to top recommendations that read like &quot;doctor&#39;s orders&quot; for health systems that recognize the climate challenge and are ready to lead. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Consider the social determinants</strong> of health as critical to community resilience, including a broader definition of health and health care – not just clinical “sick care.” Partner with community organizations and others to better understand health needs of various populations to support community-driven healthy lifestyles and stronger social cohesion in preparation for emergencies. This is important to building communities&#39; physiological and psychological health and resilience, and should be in concert with neighborhood redevelopment and quality of life enhancements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Be mindful of the way ﬂood barriers can make a hospital a fortress</strong> and separate it from surrounding neighborhoods during extreme events; efforts should protect the facility and community, not separate them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ensure ambulatory facilities reopen quickly</strong> to anchor distressed and damaged communities. They can be places to shelter, charge phones, get information, and provide other “safe haven” services.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Create robust networks</strong> of partnerships to anchor community health &amp; resilience.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Broaden engagement</strong> in climate-smart public policy, at facility, city-wide and state levels.</p></li>

369,Introducing Barr's ArtsAmplified Initiative,"<p>A $30 million, six-year effort focused on powerful art and bold leadership by Massachusetts arts organizations to create more vibrant communities.</p>","<p>Today, Barr is pleased to announce a major new investment out of our Arts &amp; Creativity program. Its goal is to increase the capacity of 15 accomplished arts organizations to lead within communities, and to generate fresh insights that inspire other nonprofits and funders.</p>

<p>As Jim Canales notes <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/barr-announces-new-effort-to-amplify-arts"">in his post today</a>, at the Barr Foundation, we believe artists, arts, and creativity are essential to vibrant communities. We know that arts can be especially important at a time when shifting demographics, technologies, and politics are affecting the places and ways people live. We also recognize that bold, capable organizations amplify arts’ impact.</p>

<p>ArtsAmplified provides funding to help each organization advance at least one ambitious project with significance for its vision. We also expect to learn along with these partners—and to generate new knowledge that has value to a broader group of funders and nonprofits.</p>
<h3>Four interrelated concepts are central to the initiative</h3>
<p>Initiative partners will explore the confluence of four concepts that Barr considers vital to the future of arts organizations—artistic excellence, relevance, risk taking, and civic leadership. We enter the initiative with these working definitions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Artistic excellence</strong> enables the full expression of voices and viewpoints. It is rigorous in application, demonstrating artistic integrity and mastery of craft. It is expansive in form and inclusive in application, spanning many tastes and disciplines. Artistic excellence is realized when artists and art organizations create experiences that are compelling, meaningful, and relevant for today’s audiences.</li>
</ul>

<p><div class=""Media -aside -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img alt=""Graphic showing the four key concepts of ArtsAmplified "" class=""Media-image"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2347/crop_preview.png?1642123440"" /> </div> </div></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Relevance</strong> is a measure of the value and relatability of art to a variety of audiences and communities. Relevant art is cognizant of social, political, and cultural contexts—it speaks to people by addressing their realities, hopes, and fears.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Risk taking</strong> happens when arts organizations leap forward. It encompasses any substantive organizational change, and includes artistic experimentation and supporting the artist’s journey or curation to produce work that combines excellence and relevance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Civic leadership</strong> stems from arts organizations embracing their distinct ability to bring people together and strengthen connections. It features artistic processes and art that engages multiple viewpoints, encourages new ways of understanding, and helps communities envision and work together toward a better future.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, each of our partners brings their own experiences, definitions, and ambitions to this investigation. We look forward to vivid dialogue about the interplay of the four concepts, and to sharper understanding of the opportunities and challenges they present for arts organizations today.</p>
<h3>A cohort of organizations embracing change</h3>
<p>We are pleased to join with this group of partners, who are among the many organizations producing artistically excellent work across Massachusetts:</p>

</ul>

<p>Each of these partners is also at an important inflection point in its own lifecycle—pivoting to better align its approaches and resources with its intent to generate greater impact. All are future-focused. They commit to nurturing artists and the curatorial process, are unafraid to question cultural orthodoxy, and consider contemporary issues to be important content for their programming. They share a sense of urgency to amplify arts’ role in communities today.</p>

<p><em>“Historically, we have focused our attention nationally and internationally. In this next evolution, we’re looking at the conditions in Berkshire County and asking ourselves: What sort of neighbor and citizen do we want to be?” – Pamela Tatge, Director, Jacob’s Pillow</em></p>

<p><em>“We have unprecedented opportunities to make art more central in people’s lives. All we need to do to make this happen is give up some old ideas and practices, and invent new ones.”
– Dan L. Monroe, The Rose-Marie and Eijk van Otterloo Director and CEO, Peabody Essex Museum</em></p>

<p><em>“Given Boston&#39;s history, we want to be part of telling a new story for the city, particularly as it relates to race. We are expanding our programming, looking to hear and listen and engage voices that haven’t always been at the table.” – David C.

<h3>A process of co-discovery</h3>
<p>Barr ArtsAmplified partners will work in a collective context, joining in ongoing conversation anchored in the notions of excellence, relevance, risk taking, and civic leadership. The first year of the initiative is a time for each organization to take stock of its realities and future intent, and to assess its strengths and needs. The partners and Barr will co-design strategies and expected outputs for subsequent years of the initiative. <a href=""http://www.tdcorp.org/"">TDC</a> will serve as a facilitator and learning partner in this process.</p>

<p>Barr intends to be an active learner alongside all participants, and to support these organizations with risk capital as they experiment and evolve.</p>

<p>The arts are fundamental and necessary for the health of the human spirit. They enable us to discover who we are and who we may become as individuals, as communities, and as human beings. ArtsAmplified is a multi-year effort to help 15 of the Commonwealth’s leading arts institutions amplify their contributions to the future of our State and all its citizens.</p>

<p>We look forward to sharing news, progress, and lessons throughout the journey.

368,Investing in Arts Organizations as Leaders,"<p>In partnership with 15 Massachusetts arts organizations, Barr launches a $30 million, six-year effort to amplify their leadership in changing communities.</p>","<p>Since its inception, the Barr Foundation has supported the arts, and in recent years, we have expanded this commitment, both through growth in Barr’s arts grantmaking and through the geographic expansion of our Arts &amp; Creativity program. We have deepened this commitment to the arts out of an abiding belief that artists, arts, and creativity are essential to vibrant and engaged communities.</p>

<p>This is particularly true in today’s environment, as the pace of change accelerates and as we look to the arts to offer opportunities for expression, to help deepen our understanding, and to promote discussion and engagement.</p>

<p>Accordingly, by presenting powerful art that speaks to contemporary issues, arts organizations have the capacity to connect people and perspectives—prompting reflection, fueling dialogue, and enhancing our communities.</p>

<p>To advance this vital work, I am delighted to announce the launch of ArtsAmplified, a six-year, $30 million initiative investing in fifteen large and mid-size organizations across Massachusetts dedicated to creating art and arts experiences that strengthen our communities.</p>

<p>ArtsAmplified will provide funding to help each participating organization to advance an ambitious project with significance to its future. ArtsAmplified features a shared commitment to investigating and learning together about the relationship among artistic excellence, relevance, risk taking, and civic leadership—four dimensions at the center of the initiative.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--a""> <p>features</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>ArtsAmplified also includes additional resources for market research, financial analysis, board and staff development, and other investments that can help each organization build and sustain its capacity to achieve greater impact.</p>

<p>This initiative recognizes that presenting art that is both excellent and relevant requires that organizations have resources to be nimble and test new ideas. They must also have the credibility and means to engage new audiences in authentic ways. And they must be resilient in the face of the risks inherent in assuming greater leadership within their communities.</p>

<p>We could not be more excited to embark on this critical work, with a commitment to learning from it and to sharing our lessons with others.

367,Leadership in the Storm,"<p>Climate-smart health care protects lives, communities, hospitals, and citizens' wallets.</p>","<p>After a dangerous and costly winter storm season ending with four Nor&#39;easters in three weeks following multiple hurricane and wildfire disasters, common sense says climate change is accelerating. It is putting our entire region and our health care systems on the front lines of what&#39;s been called the greatest public health threat of the century.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Massachusetts can add climate-smart action to its global fame for health care leadership.  Two recent, Barr Foundation-supported reports by <a href=""https://noharm-uscanada.org/BostonResilienceEvent"">Health Care Without Harm</a> help readers understand how health care itself is at risk from climate change, and feature local health care progress. </p>

<p class=""tyler"">Read &#39;SAFE HAVEN IN THE STORM&#39;<a href=""https://noharm-uscanada.org/safehaven%22%5D"">https://noharm-uscanada.org/safehaven&quot;]</a></p>

<p>Part One of this two-part blog explores how climate-smart hospitals can protect lives, stay open, and stay financially healthy in the face of extreme weather, explored in a recent report, &quot;Safe haven in the storm: Protecting lives and margins with climate smart health care.&quot;  Part Two will drill into a second report on the infrastructure, social equity and planning challenges that hospitals and their stakeholders face as they work to anchor more resilient, healthy communities.</p>

<p>Worldwide and locally, climate change and more extreme weather events are already increasing deaths, injury, illness, and violence. Hospitals are supposed to be the last building standing but have proven vulnerable, with disruptions to surgeries, treatments, facilities, staffing, research, mission-critical supplies, and even their financial health:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hurricane Sandy caused NYU Langone Hospital&#39;s emergency department to close for 18 months; surgeries stopped for 2 months, and $700 million in irreplaceable medical research was lost. </li>
<li>The Santa Rosa fires evacuated two hospitals, even as respiratory ailments surged. </li>
<li>Boston&#39;s extreme winter storms in 2015 forced Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital to postpone or cancel surgeries, resulting in a $10 million loss.</li>
<li>Hurricanes Maria and Irma destroyed intravenous fluid factories in Puerto Rico, creating ongoing nationwide shortages, among many other impacts.<br></li>
</ul>

<p>The human toll extends far beyond hospital walls to utilities, infrastructure, and our communities, hitting the most vulnerable hardest; poverty rates typically increase after big disasters, driving up uninsured / underinsured care costs.  And then there&#39;s the significant mental health trauma and stress, particularly for those who lose loved ones, income or jobs, housing, and/or hard-earned savings.</p>

<p>&quot;Safe haven&quot; by Health Care Without Harm in collaboration with PricewaterhouseCoopers Advisory Services LLC, is the first report in the world for health care executives that examines climate-aggravated extreme weather events&#39; impacts on hospital finances. Its framework, detailed below in Figure 1, enables sector leaders to weigh the costs of being ill-prepared, from inability to treat patients to reduced reimbursement. &quot;Safe haven&quot; also lays out the cascade of benefits that accrue if they make investments that both protect patients and hospitals&#39; often surprisingly fragile financial health.</p>
<h4>Figure 1: The costs of being ill-prepared</h4>

<p>The smart sector leaders showcased in &quot;Safe Haven&quot; are taking mutually reinforcing actions: managing extreme weather risks, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, investing in community health and resilience, and leading on clean energy and climate policy. <em>See Figure 3.</em>  Leading by example, they are urging their peers and all of us to do the same. </p>
<h3>Two local examples from &quot;Safe haven:&quot;</h3>
<p><div class=""Media -aside -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img alt=""HCWH Figure 3"" class=""Media-image"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2300/crop_preview.jpg?1642123285"" /> </div> <div class=""Media-caption""> <p>3</p> </div> </div>
Boston Medical Center&#39;s advanced energy and resiliency efforts include a combined heat and power plant that can supply the hospital and a key part of the City&#39;s emergency communications network when the grid is down.  BMC&#39;s climate leadership has generated meaningful additional benefits; at least $5 million in gifts and improved recruiting; candidates routinely cite their knowledge of BMC&#39;S sustainability work. Our two green bond offerings, totaling more than $200 million, greatly broadened our pool of environmentally responsible investors, and were quickly oversubscribed.</p>

<p>Partners HealthCare&#39;s strategic plan reduces both energy consumption and environmental footprint while making facilities more resilient to climate-driven events like flooding, sea level rise and high winds. Our new Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital, is nationally recognized for its patient-centered healthy design and as &quot;the climate resilient hospital of the future.&quot; The $1.5 million we spent in resilience investments was recovered quickly through utility rebates and energy savings of $500,000/year. We plow those savings back into more and better patient care.</p>

<p>Both facilities are years ahead of meeting Boston&#39;s and the Commonwealth&#39;s goals of 25 percent greenhouse gas reductions by 2020, and are on track to be carbon neutral for all buildings&#39; energy by 2025 if not sooner.</p>

<p>Both institutions are actively educating lawmakers, bringing the moral voice of health care to advance climate-smart public policy.  The communities they serve cannot thrive if greenhouse gas emissions are not largely eliminated, if climate threatens health, if we can&#39;t flush toilets or get to work.</p>

<p>It&#39;s reassuring that health care is stepping up to face accelerating, increasingly intense climate threats. It is doubly good the actions in <a href=""https://noharm-uscanada.org/safehaven"">&quot;Safe haven in the storm: Protecting lives and margins with climate smart health care&quot;</a> also help contain health care&#39;s share of our households&#39; and the Commonwealth&#39;s budgets, a pressing matter for us all.</p>"

Yet, despite significant demographic shifts, recent reports (Compass Point’s <a href=""http://daringtolead.org/"">“Daring to Lead”</a> and Board Source’s <a href=""https://boardsource.org/research-critical-issues/nonprofit-sector-research/"">“Leading with Intent”</a>) have consistently found that nonprofit leaders were overwhelmingly white (over 80 percent) and that the sector was not making progress in hiring more people of color into top leadership positions. In an effort to address the sources of this racial leadership gap, one of Building Movement Project’s goals has been to understand why it has persisted. Barr Foundation is honored to support BMP’s national research as well as a local report that unpacks the challenges and opportunities in Massachusetts.</em></p>

<p>This April, our organization – the Building Movement Project (BMP) – released <a href=""http://www.buildingmovement.org/reports/entry/the_nonprofit_racial_leadership_gap_in_massachusetts_a_race_to_lead_brief"">“The Nonprofit Racial Leadership Gap in Massachusetts: A Race to Lead Brief,”</a> thanks to the support of the Barr Foundation. This latest report in <a href=""http://racetolead.org/"">our series</a> on race and leadership in the nonprofit sector examines the state findings from our national survey exploring why there are so few people of color running nonprofit organizations. The report draws on data from nearly two hundred people from Massachusetts and more than 4,000 people across the country who completed the survey, as well as what we heard from four focus groups we conducted in Boston earlier this year. </p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--on""> <p>report</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Why focus on Massachusetts? One factor that made us curious about the Bay State was the series of articles by <a href=""https://apps.bostonglobe.com/spotlight/boston-racism-image-reality/"">The Boston Globe’s Spotlight Team</a> examining the perception and reality of racism in Boston that lead to the city’s notoriety as one of the country’s “most racist.” The people who participated in our focus groups – both whites and people of color – were acutely aware of how this reputation was reflected in the nonprofit sector. One white staffer said, “I think the nonprofit community is really self-conscious about its own reputation for being racist.” In our focus group with women of color, one person reflected on her time working at a white-led nonprofit organization, saying “I knew what I was signing up for … I was born and raised in Boston, in predominantly white settings my entire life.” But she was still surprised to encounter a “very clear discrepancy in the recognition and support given” to staff based on their race and gender.</p>

<p>While the region’s legacy of discrimination, segregation and inequality has lasting impacts on the ways nonprofits in Massachusetts are led and resourced, responses to the survey paralleled what we found on a national level. The Nonprofit Racial Leadership Gap in Massachusetts offers ideas for making change based on both the survey data and insights from focus group participants:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Examine institutional practices.</strong> Respondents consistently cited the challenges nonprofit leaders of colors face in raising money, especially in Massachusetts where elite white wealth is hard to access. To counter this issue, we call on funders to examine their own grantmaking practices, to ensure that they are not contributing to funding disparities based on race.</li>
<li><strong>Support and advance staff of color.</strong> To strengthen and diversify top leadership, the nonprofit sector needs to re-think its models for staff development to provide many pathways for staff to take on new challenges and build their skills, even if it means helping staff of color advance by taking new jobs in different organizations. </li>
<li><strong>Build a community of changemakers.</strong> We believe that all nonprofit leaders can challenge the implicit and structural biases blocking progress and equity. Building a sense of community among leaders who are taking these steps will normalize and support the work of addressing race head on and develop best practices for making change in our organizations.<br></li>
</ul>

<p>We released this latest “Race to Lead Brief” at a forum hosted by The Boston Foundation on April 2, 2018. In addition to presenting the findings, we were joined by a panel of local leaders that included Michael James (Senior VP of Human Resources Old Colony YMCA), Imari Paris Jeffries (Executive Director of Parenting Journey), Jocelyn Sargent (Executive Director of Hyams Foundation), Cassie Scarano  (CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Commongood Careers), and Celina Miranda (Executive Director of Hyde Square Task Force).</p>

365,Timely New Report Shows Substantial Disparities in Energy Savings Among Massachusetts Communities,<p>Analysis shows that some communities are not benefitting equally from the state’s top-ranked energy efficiency programs.</p>,"<p>Year after year, Massachusetts is recognized nationally for its efficiency efforts. Yet, our utility-administered programs consistently fail to capture all cost-effective energy savings, despite being required to do so by state law. In addition, barriers to accessing energy efficiency savings persist for low-and moderate-income residential customers, renters, and households for whom English is not a primary language. The result is that some communities are under-served by programs that we all support. A new report by the Applied Economics Clinic (AEC), commissioned by the Conservation Law Foundation in collaboration with the Green Justice Coalition (GJC), puts into sharp relief the extent to which the Commonwealth’s award winning programs are not reaching the Bay Staters who stand to benefit the most from the energy and financial savings that come from efficiency programs.</p>
<h4>How do savings from efficiency in your community compare to other places in Massachusetts?</h4>
<p class=""tyler"">Read the report: <em>Accessing Energy Efficiency in Massachusetts</em><a href=""https://aeclinic.org/publicationpages/2018/2/26/accessing-energy-efficiency-in-massachusetts%22%5D"">https://aeclinic.org/publicationpages/2018/2/26/accessing-energy-efficiency-in-massachusetts&quot;]</a></p>
<h3>Energy Efficiency: Who benefits from energy-saving programs in Massachusetts?</h3>
<p>Energy efficiency is our cheapest, cleanest, and most abundant energy resource. It helps consumers save money, reduces the need for new energy infrastructure, and benefits public health and the environment by reducing emissions. Massachusetts law requires regulated natural gas and electric companies to exhaust all energy efficiency options that are “cost-effective or less expensive than new supply.” In other words, utilities must first look to efficiency so long as it is the cheaper option as compared to electricity and natural gas.</p>

<p>Eversource, National Grid, Unitil, Liberty Utilities, Columbia Gas, Blackstone Gas, Berkshire Gas, and the Cape Light Compact have developed and implemented ratepayer-funded gas and electric efficiency programs in three-year increments since 2010. The programs are administered as “Mass Save,” and energy-saving improvements that meet eligibility criteria are partially funded by a small portion of <a href=""http://blog.massenergy.org/blog/electric-bill-deconstructed"">every dollar paid on gas and electricity bills</a>. The three-year program plans are reviewed by a stakeholder advisory board, which makes recommendations to state regulators, who in turn review and approve the programs. The process of developing the programs that will be in place for 2019-2021 is currently under way. As the programs approach their tenth year, now is the time to address disparities in who benefits from the programs, and to ask the question of how the programs are doing in reaching traditionally under-served communities and harder-to-reach families.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--award-winning""> <p>Commonwealth</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Since 2008, the Green Justice Coalition and allied organizations have noted that some residents—including renters, low-to-moderate-income households, and people with limited English-proficiency—are either not reached at all by Mass Save programs, or are not adequately served when they do participate in the programs. For as long as these programs have been in place, GJC has challenged the utilities and policy-makers to quantify and address this disparity and is doing so again during the current three-year planning process.</p>
<h3>New analysis shows that program improvements are necessary to reach all customers.</h3>
<p>Despite notable improvements in the programs themselves, and in outreach efforts, thanks in part due to the work of GJC members and allied groups, participation in efficiency programs that serve low-to-moderate income communities has remained very low.</p>

<p>The recent study found that the efficiency programs successfully reduced energy consumption statewide between 2013 and 2015, but demographic analysis found that communities with the lowest participation in Mass Save have, on average, proportionally higher percentages of renters, low- and moderate-income people, and households with English as a second language. Even in Boston, a community that enjoys high savings, significant disparities exist between neighborhoods. For example, statewide program energy savings is 2.7%, but for residents in Boston neighborhoods savings range from 1.7% in Allston, to 2.5% in East Boston, to 3.1% in West Roxbury. This suggests that even within a high-performing city, where you live matters when it comes to saving energy and saving money. We believe that it shouldn’t.</p>

<p>In addition, the new analysis shows that the publicly available data about who is served by our ratepayer-funded programs is incomplete. In order to fully evaluate the programs’ reach and effectiveness, the report points out that access to more complete data is needed. As a result, we will continue to push the state and the utilities to release more data to help us understand these issues, and ensure more equitable delivery of the programs.</p>

<h3>Where to go from here?</h3>
<p>AEC’s analysis not only supports the need for program improvements long championed by GJC and its allies, but the maps in the report also provide a clear picture of where there are more energy savings to obtain. At a minimum, the 2019-2021 efficiency plan must address the data and demographic service gaps identified in the study, including dedicated budgets to address barriers to access and to mitigate disparities among communities. For our part, we will continue to challenge the program administrators and policymakers to develop modern and accessible efficiency programs that benefit everyone equitably while serving as a solid foundation to a clean energy transition. Efficiency is a low-cost, zero-emission, local, job-creating energy source. With three plans and nearly 10 years under our collective belts, it is time to ensure that everyone can benefit from energy efficiency. Let’s keep Massachusetts number one in efficiency – for everyone.</p>"
364,En Nuestro Barrio—Where the Young People Lead the Way,<p>Second in a new video series featuring stories from Greater Boston arts organizations that received special funding to pursue an artistic risk.</p>,"<p><em>The Arts are always about taking risks. But funding for risk-taking is often hard to come by. With new resources dedicated to artistic risk, seven organizations pushed themselves beyond their comfort zones. This story of what happened comes from Hyde Square Task Force’s Executive Director, Celina Miranda, and Director of Arts and Education Programs, Brenda Rodriguez-Andujar.</em></p>

<p><div class=""Media -full""> <div class=""u-fluid-iframe""> <div class=""u-fluid-iframe-inner""> <iframe src=""//player.vimeo.com/video/264640587?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0"" title=""Featured Video"" frameborder=""0"" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen loading=""lazy""> <a href=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/264640587?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0"">A video on Vimeo</a> </iframe> </div> </div> </div></p>

<p>Kids do come to Hyde Square Task Force to celebrate Afro-Latin arts and culture. But we’re a youth development organization before we’re an arts organization. It’s our job to make sure that youth who come through our doors are prepared for success in life. And we find ways to help them develop the right skills to get there through the arts.</p>

<p>Youth who participate in our theatre, dance, and music programs have an interest in acting, performing, or learning an instrument. But they typically have no formal training before they walk through our doors. Nevertheless, they had the idea to create an original musical and tell the story of their community—even though they had not seen something like that done before in a way that they could actually relate to. They have not seen many people who looked like them, talked like them, or who lived in a place like our neighborhood—Boston’s Latin Quarter—portrayed in entertainment or the arts, at least not positively. So, when they saw Lin-Manuel Miranda’s <em>In the Heights</em>, it was an aha moment. They could see elements of themselves and the Latin Quarter represented in the story. <em>In the Heights</em> really inspired the youth and served as an example of what was possible.</p>

<p>The Latin Quarter is a neighborhood that, despite its progress, still struggles like many immigrant communities do. The youth were determined to show others that the Latin Quarter also has a rich history and vibrant culture that should be celebrated. Our musical was brought to life thanks to the resources and flexibility we received from the Barr and Klarman Foundations. Though we had never tried it before, our young people co-produced, co-directed, and co-wrote an original musical celebrating their community—combining all three arts programs offered at HSTF.</p>

<p>They took the Latin Quarter of yesterday and connected it with the Latin Quarter of today, inspiring our community and their families, and celebrating the contributions of Afro-Latinos both in the arts and in the role they played shaping the identity of this community. This musical was a testament to that.</p>

<p>We tested our capacity to pull this off. Even if everything came together, even if the community showed up to see it, even if this huge risk paid off, would we have the ability to keep delivering something like this year after year?</p>

<p>As an organization, we were scared by these questions. But, we were more worried about letting down young people who were excited about creating something for their community—and who were not afflicted by the doubts of the adults around them. They poured their hearts and souls into this. We took a risk on doing something we had never attempted before. We dove in, following the lead of our kids. We could not have done it any other way.</p>

<h3>About the Barr-Klarman Arts Capacity Building Initiative and this video series:</h3>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/arts-creativity/barr-klarman-arts-capacity-building"">Barr-Klarman Arts Capacity Building Initiative</a> was a five-year initiative to strengthen the long term financial health of a group of Boston area arts organizations. Throughout the Initiative, the partners grappled with the question: capitalization to what end? What’s the desired change for the organization and for our communities? First, the cohort explored what organizational risks could look like, and the kinds of capital needed. And in the last two years, the partners asked what taking risks in the art and curation looked like, and what kinds of support are needed for risk-taking. A fund was set up as part of the Initiative, with the goal of supporting projects that took organizations out of the comfort zone of their usual practice, potentially against standard field practice, and with the potential to change their organizational way of working.</p>

<p>These commissioned videos document the journey of the seven projects that were funded. Each centers on one organization and, through the eyes of its leaders, gives a glimpse into one journey of artistic risk-taking. We hope that these leaders and projects will engage you a conversation that deepens understanding and builds support for this exciting kind of work.</p>"
363,Fellowship Opportunity for New England’s Creative Changemakers,<p>National Arts Strategies seeks applications through April 22nd from creative leaders driving positive change in their communities.</p>,"<p>Across the country, there are creative people working to make their communities better for everyone. Our goal through the <a href=""http://www.artstrategies.org/programs/creative-community-fellows/"">Creative Community Fellows</a> program at National Arts Strategies (NAS) is to give them the skills they need, and a community of peers to create even greater impacts. Allentza Michel of Boston’s Mattapan neighborhood was one of our fellows last year. Allentza saw two challenges in her community – a lack of studio space for local artists, and a need to rebrand and revitalize its public space. By connecting artists and designers with residents, Allentza came up with a creative solution: turning the entire neighborhood into a canvas. Her team is working to transform intersections that need crosswalks, parking spots that might be parklets, and old payphones that sit untouched and dusty. The project is bringing a renewed vibrancy and sense of community to the neighborhood. </p>

<p><div class=""Media -small -left""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img alt=""Allentza headshot"" class=""Media-image"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2258/crop_preview.jpg?1642123185"" /> </div> <div class=""Media-caption""> <p>Michel</p> </div> </div></p>

<p>When Allentza participated in NAS’s Creative Community Fellows program, she sharpened her problem-solving skills and her ability to move people toward a shared goal. The Fellows program brings cultural trailblazers together for five months, to be part of something bigger, to learn life-changing skills and to see dreams become reality. The Fellows include artists, community organizers, urban planners, arts administrators and cultural entrepreneurs, all united by their integration of arts and culture into positive community change strategies. Fellows are driven by their desire to connect and exchange with one another and a love for the places they call home.</p>

<p>And now, NAS is seeking a class of 25 Fellows who call New England home. A recent grant from the Barr Foundation expanded the Fellows program to New England in order to support creative leaders in the region and allow them to participate tuition-free. Applications for the Fellowship are open now through April 22nd.</p>
<h4>To get a sense of the Fellowship experience, watch the video below.</h4>

<p>Fellows jumpstart the program by living and learning together for one week in Vermont in an incubator-like environment building their skills in strategy, leadership and design thinking. Over the course of five months, they take monthly online courses in topic areas such as community development, finding capital and support, budgeting and more. Together, they share updates on their projects and meet with leaders in the field who serve as mentors. Fellows test, adapt, and build on their work, walking away with clarity and a strategy to move forward.</p>

<p>New England is a diverse region, including rural, urban and suburban communities with different kinds of community dynamics. Fellows will benefit from hearing the range of perspectives represented within the cohort – unlocking potential solutions to the community issues they are addressing. Together, they will form a network of support as each one makes a shift towards positive community change.</p>

<p>Creative change makers like Allentza and other alumni are driving transformation across the region alongside local partners.

362,Partners Join to Create a Waterfront Where All People Feel Welcome,<p>Nonprofits unite under shared vision for the Boston waterfront.</p>,"<p>What would Boston’s waterfront look like if it were the favorite destination of residents and visitors alike? What needs to change so that everyone, across all Boston neighborhoods, is invited to live, work, and play along the city’s 43 miles of coastline?</p>

<p>For more than two years through a <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/boston-waterfront"">special initiative</a> focused on the Boston waterfront, Barr has invested in efforts to conduct Harbor-wide planning, explore opportunities for new and improved parks and design, and increase resilience to climate change impacts. We issued a <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/barr-announces-request-for-proposals-as-part-of-waterfront-initiative"">request for proposals last fall</a>, with the goal of helping to amplify the perspectives of residents and communities most impacted by decisions about the Harbor. Out of the responses to that call, we welcomed six new partners to this growing effort last December.</p>

<p>They join four organizations already involved in waterfront efforts. These 10 partners recently met as a group for the first time (pictured above) and quickly coalesced around four essential characteristics of a great waterfront for all:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Welcoming:</strong> Inviting and affordable for everyone, particularly for people and communities historically excluded.</li>
<li><strong>Fun:</strong> Offering a range of exciting activities and interesting places designed for people’s enjoyment and comfort.</li>
<li><strong>Productive:</strong> Providing good jobs, housing, and other economic opportunities and benefits.</li>
<li><strong>Resilient:</strong> Protecting Boston’s Harbor-adjacent and inland neighborhoods from impacts of climate change like storm surges and flooding.</li>
</ul>

<p>The partners also identified a set of shared values to drive their collective vision for the waterfront: fairness and integrity, equity and inclusion, and community benefit. The <a href=""https://s20222.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Ib2030%20BOOK_Spreads--Create%20a%20Waterfront%20for%20Future%20Generations.pdf"">City of Boston’s waterfront goals</a>, as articulated through the Imagine Boston 2030 planning process, were some of the important foundations for the partners’ discussion.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--identified""> <p>partners</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>The six new partners—who work in East Boston; Fort Point and South Boston; Roxbury and North Dorchester; and North Charlestown—are helping people connect with Boston’s waterfront in a variety of creative ways: alliance-building among neighborhood associations; family-oriented programs at cultural and civic spaces on the Harbor; designing for maximum access to the water; stakeholder surveys and focus groups; and interactive artmaking and creative placemaking efforts. All of the partners bring decades of varied experience in community activism and many successful campaigns to curb displacement, to advance environmental and public health, and to establish and improve public parks and greenways throughout Boston and beyond.</p>

<p>Building on those strengths, the partners will continue to develop a shared advocacy agenda, invest in robust and inclusive programming, set measurable goals and indicators of progress, and support each other’s work.

361,Uncharted Territory: Where an Arts Organization Dares to Go (But Dollars Can be Difficult to Find),<p>First in a new series featuring stories from Greater Boston arts organizations that received special funding to pursue an artistic risk.</p>,"<p><em>The Arts are always about taking risks. But funding for risk-taking is often hard to come by. With new resources dedicated to artistic risk, seven organizations pushed themselves beyond their comfort zones. This first story of what happened comes from The Theater Offensive’s Acting Artistic Director, Evelyn Francis.</em>  </p>

<p>The Theater Offensive was founded in the midst of the early AIDS epidemic of the 1980s.  The founders, made up of street activists and performers, were experiencing first-hand the daily anguish the epidemic caused in their lives and their community.  While the government sat silent, each week TTO artists were risking their lives to amplify the voices of those who could no longer speak; working to use theater to mourn, to build empathy, to educate, and to make radical systemic change.  It’s fair to say that “risk” has deep roots in our organization.  </p>

<p>Over our thirty-year history, we’ve made it our mission to fight against the tide of racism, homophobia, transphobia, and violence that continues to permeate Boston – to strive for a city where LGBTQ people are able to not just survive, but fully thrive.  Neighborhoods are being gentrified rapidly, and artists, particularly LGBTQ Artists of Color, can’t make a living here.  Jamaica Plain, Dorchester, Roxbury, and the South End are full of talented artists that can make a better living in New York, and many of them have done just that.  At The Theater Offensive, we know that we cannot make this dream of a thriving city a reality without the creative vision of Boston artists.  </p>

<p>By 2009, we were presenting mostly national touring productions, but had heard a need for us to move away for the conventional theater company model.  We created a model of community listening, called “SpeakOUT” events, to provide local folks opportunities to tell us what they wanted from us. And, we listened. At one of these events in 2015, artists spoke about the lack of resources available to them in Boston.  Creation space is limited. Fair pay for work is difficult to get. Mentorship opportunities are near nonexistent.  From here, the idea began to take shape of a residency program supporting local artists with intersecting identities.  We created the outline of a program, called the OUT’hood Residency Program, which would: </p>

<ol>
<li>support Boston LGBTQ artists in their professional development,<br></li>
<li>connect these artists with our neighborhoods and intersecting movements, and<br></li>
<li>provide performing opportunities to present their work. </li>
</ol>

<p>Once we had the plan drafted, we waited for a funder to take a chance on the exceptional artists of Boston. When we had the opportunity to apply for this special risk funding from Barr and the <a href=""http://klarmanfoundation.org/"">Klarman Family Foundation</a>, we knew immediately what we wanted to do with it – make this dream of a residency program for LGBTQ artists a reality.  And it yielded amazing results.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--to""> <p>have</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Our community is our passion, and our art is a vehicle for radical change. It fosters empathy, builds understanding, and centers the voices of those most marginalized in the LGBTQ community.  It’s also our work. That means needing the time and the money and the infrastructure to produce it.  You also need the guts. You have to have room to question, to mess things up, to break the rules a little (or a lot), and this initiative allowed us to do this in important ways. We got to witness the impact that a residency program can have on local, up-and-coming LGBTQ Artists of Color and the community.  We got to see how far we could push ourselves and test this program as a viable business model for us.</p>

<p>While we are still exploring the future of the residency program, one thing is clear: our work has always been about striving to respond to what the world and our communities need. Being able to do so boldly, unapologetically, unabashedly: that is artistic risk, and it is where this initiative dared to go with us.</p>

<h4>About the Barr-Klarman Arts Capacity Building Initiative and this video series:</h4>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/arts-creativity/barr-klarman-arts-capacity-building"">Barr-Klarman Arts Capacity Building Initiative</a> was a five-year initiative to strengthen the long term financial health of a group of Boston area arts organizations. Throughout the Initiative, the partners grappled with the question: capitalization to what end? What’s the desired change for the organization and for our communities? First, the cohort explored what organizational risks could look like, and the kinds of capital needed. And in the last two years, the partners asked what taking risks in the art and curation looked like, and what kinds of support are needed for risk-taking. A fund was set up as part of the Initiative, with the goal of supporting projects that took organizations out of the comfort zone of their usual practice, potentially against standard field practice, and with the potential to change their organizational way of working.</p>

<p>These commissioned videos document the journey of the seven projects that were funded. Each centers on one organization and, through the eyes of its leaders, gives a glimpse into one journey of artistic risk-taking. We hope that these leaders and projects will engage you a conversation that deepens understanding and builds support for this exciting kind of work.</p>"
358,"With More Control, Communities Choose Clean Energy","<p>Darlene Lombos, the Executive Director of Community Labor United and Class of 2017 Barr Fellow, makes the case for Community Choice Energy as a tool for empowering communities and meeting climate goals.</p>","<p>Across Massachusetts, communities are taking control over where their energy comes from. By leveraging local bulk purchasing power, more than 100 towns and cities in the Bay State have increased the amount of renewable energy they buy each year, while at the same time producing savings for consumers.</p>

<p>Community Choice Energy (CCE, also known as “community choice aggregation” or “municipal aggregation”) is an important tool for communities to meet their energy needs, to make progress on their climate goals, and – according to new research – to save money. Compared to Eversource’s basic service rates for January through June 2018, communities with a CCE program will <a href=""https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5936d98f6a4963bcd1ed94d3/t/5a1ed4e58165f542d6481501/1511970021847/Updated+CCE+rates_onepager.pdf"">save consumers an average of nearly 20 percent</a>, according to the Tufts Applied Economics Clinic. That’s a substantial increase from a 2 percent savings in 2017, suggesting that CCE provides not only a pathway to cleaner energy, but also long-term savings for consumers.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--Energy""> <p>Choice</p> </blockquote>  </p>

<p>With Washington abdicating leadership, and even actively working to undermine progress on climate and clean energy, state and local action is more important than ever. While CCE benefits local businesses and residents by giving them a say in where their energy comes from and often reducing energy bills, the benefits extend far beyond those communities. These benefits include bringing cleaner, more sustainable energy to the region, reducing our carbon footprint, and improving health outcomes by lessening fossil fuel pollution. Clean energy is also an important part of the innovative economy of the future, keeping our energy dollars in our own region and fueling jobs and economic growth close to home.</p>

<p>Thanks to advocacy by local groups including the <a href=""https://bostoncan.org/"">Boston Climate Action Network</a> and the <a href=""http://clud6.prometheuslabor.com/green-justice-campaign"">Green Justice Coalition</a>, along with strong leadership on the Boston City Council, a proposal for Boston to implement Community Choice Energy was unanimously approved in October 2017. This is an exciting and important step for Boston to take as it implements Mayor Marty Walsh’s goal of being carbon neutral by 2050.</p>

<p>As the largest metro area in the state, Boston must play a leading role in meeting our climate goals as a state, while also reducing emissions and increasing resiliency in the city. Through CCE, Boston can expect to increase its clean energy portfolio by at least 5 percent, helping to reach its goal of a 25 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. <a href=""https://aeclinic.org/publicationpages/2017/9/29/an-analysis-of-community-choice-energy-for-boston"">A report</a> investigating the potential of CCE for the city of Boston shows that while CCE is but one of many steps that the city must take to address climate change, it is an important one that has been proven by many neighboring communities.</p>

<p>While CCE is not a silver bullet – and there are many additional tools we can and must use – it is clearly a tool that more municipalities should adopt. And we need more policies that make it easier for communities to adopt CCE as part of broader efforts to ensure our city is more independent and resilient, and is reaping the benefits of the clean energy boom.</p>

<p>The recent wave of adoption of Community Choice Energy is something worth celebrating. These wins demonstrate that strong leadership and action can still drive change at the local level and represent an important move towards democratizing our energy consumption by giving local communities a say. Now more than ever, legislators and other public officials need to play a key role in continuing to advance policies like CCE to unleash the full potential we have in the Commonwealth to stem the effects of climate change and position Massachusetts as a leader in renewable energy.</p>

<p>Communities, business and labor leaders will all be watching closely for Boston and other cities to implement these policies as swiftly and effectively as possible – especially when savings are on the table for consumers. Community Choice Energy is a clear pathway to cleaner, more local energy, and now we must take it.</p>

357,Board Time: Three Keys to Strategic Engagement,<p>Jim Canales contributes to a new blog series on effective foundation governance.</p>,"<p><em>A new BoardSource report, <a href=""https://leadingwithintent.org/foundation-report/?__hstc=98438528.cac4699948ef0721f4f1f9f568d3167e.1519846808900.1519928841149.1520279484706.4&__hssc=98438528.1.1520279484706&__hsfp=3223123038"">Foundation Board Leadership: A Closer Look at Foundation Board Responses to Leading with Intent 2017</a>, is an effort to better understand the particular dynamics of foundation boards, and what it takes for them to be effective. As part of a blog series, BoardSource invited several foundation leaders, including Jim Canales, to reflect on the findings, and to share perspectives from their own experiences. The following is excerpted from Jim’s piece.</em></p>

<p>One of the comments I was most struck by in the new BoardSource report was, “Board meeting time should be considered a precious and limited resource that must be leveraged strategically.” Having led two foundations over the past 14 years, I can attest to the importance of being intentional and strategic about how to organize a board’s time. Here are three ideas to address this critical need:</p>
<h3>Organize board meeting time for optimal engagement.</h3>
<p>Foundation board meetings—indeed any board meetings—can easily be consumed by routine reports and business matters that divert the board’s attention from larger strategy considerations. BoardSource notes: “Foundation executives currently report that 40 percent of all meeting time is spent on routine reporting, which severely curtails the board’s ability to spend time discussing and deliberating on more strategic and generative issues of importance to the foundation’s work.” If we don’t ensure that we are making the highest and best use of the limited time we receive from our boards, we will not succeed in engaging them more fully in strategy matters.</p>

<p>Each board meeting should provide substantive time for opportunities to engage in what Harvard education professor and governance expert Richard Chait calls “generative” work, where board and staff together are wrestling with strategic imperatives. In my experience, creating this kind of space for our boards is difficult. This can be scary for board members and for professional staff, as the latter often have greater content knowledge, and we all worry about discussions going awry. However, with clarity that you are not inviting the board to do the staff’s work, but rather seeking to benefit from the board’s collective insights and wisdom early and consistently to inform strategies being shaped, I would contend the outcome will be richer and board time more fruitfully used.</p>
<h3>Provide accessible board materials and frame discussions at the right level.</h3>
<p>In philanthropy, we pride ourselves on rigorous analysis and high-quality written materials. Many of the board books I have read and helped to produce over the years are filled with lengthy white papers, docket memos, strategy updates, and grant recommendations. Sometimes the volume of these materials can be overwhelming, not just to those of us who produce them, but to those obligated to read them. Similarly, board sessions are often heavy on presentation and light on discussion. While presentations can be informative to board members, they may not encourage the kind of desired engagement described above.</p>

<p>Devoting careful attention to how materials are prepared and discussions framed in ways that enable board members to add value is a must. In another finding, BoardSource notes: “Both chief executives and board chairs report significantly lower levels of agreement on the question of whether board meetings focus on strategy and policy, with only 26 percent of executives and 33 percent of board chairs reporting that they do ‘to a great extent.’”</p>

<p>There is much we can do with our materials and discussions that equip the board to enter a meeting with both the right information and a solid understanding of what we need from them. I am an advocate for framing questions in advance materials that clarify what we are seeking from the board in a discussion. Of course, deft facilitation during board meetings is essential to ensuring that all voices are heard, that points of disagreement are explored, and that clarity regarding outcomes and next steps is articulated.</p>
<h3>Broaden the board’s understanding of the foundation’s context and work.</h3>
<p>A common critique about boards is that they “drop in” intermittently without benefit of living the foundation’s work every day. That, of course, will not change, but one way to address this legitimate concern is to devote some of the board’s time to deepening members’ understanding of the context for the foundation’s work.</p>

<p>In this respect, whether through retreats, site visits, or guest speaker invitations, providing board members with direct access to the foundation’s partners or beneficiaries can be a powerful way to both educate them about context and energize them about the work.</p>

<p>There’s another benefit too: The context for our work is always shifting and evolving, and we would do well to balance the importance of clear strategy with the capacity to remain adaptable in the face of change. Indeed, BoardSource observes: “Effective strategy may be much more about the board’s ability to think strategically in a way that is adaptable in the face of constant change.”</p>

<p>Building in opportunities to benefit from outside perspectives can help the foundation to remain connected to the communities they serve and help the board to be attuned to the perspectives of partners in the field.</p>

<p>Foundation trustees are stewards of significant resources. They have an obligation to ensure those resources are being deployed in smart ways that advance the foundation’s mission and purpose. The suggestions above are offered in service to that goal, and what binds them together is this: Effective foundation boards have ownership for the foundation’s strategy; they understand it, they support its effective execution, and they help to improve it.</p>

<p>Such boards are also characterized by a productive partnership with their executives, grounded in mutual respect and trust. Indeed, as BoardSource notes: “Trust with chief executives that enables them to confidently engage the board in deeper, more open‐ended conversations about the foundation’s work…are essential to high‐level thinking and strategy.”</p>

<p>We should strive for nothing less.</p>

356,The Transportation Dividend,<p>New study quantifies the significant economic and quality-of-life benefits Greater Boston and Massachusetts enjoy thanks to investments in transportation.</p>,"<p>This month, <a href=""http://www.abettercity.org/"">A Better City</a> and <a href=""http://www.aecom.com/"">AECOM</a> released &quot;The Transportation Dividend: Transit Investments and the Massachusetts Economy,&quot; a new report on the economic benefits and value of the transportation system in Greater Boston—managed by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). The report gets right to the headline: Our public transit system returns economic benefits worth five times the cost of operations, and many of those benefits are experienced daily by residents. It&#39;s clear that Massachusetts&#39; current investments have paid off. But the report also includes a wake-up call—without renewed, long-term investments, our state risks the future of public transit and its ability to keep pace with regional population and economic growth.</p>

<p>Each year, Greater Boston&#39;s transportation system produces an estimated $11.4 billion in value, spurring job growth, linking people to opportunities, and—by the authors&#39; estimates—helping avoid $15 billion in spending by individuals, businesses, and government, if we didn&#39;t have our current system. Simply put, our region could not be anywhere as productive, efficient, and connected without the MBTA. The Greater Boston area, the engine of our state&#39;s economy, is powered by public transit.</p>

<p>Yet, there&#39;s more work to be done in order to support our region&#39;s full potential. Projected levels of population and job growth in our State are not sustainable without thoughtful, long-term planning, and smart, sustained, significant investments in the reliability, capacity and connectivity of our public transit system.</p>

355,10 Foundation Presidents Urge Preservation of Vital Federal Investments in Communities,"<p>ArtPlace America and its foundation partners respond to the President’s 2019 Federal Budget Request that proposes cuts to the National Endowment for the Arts, among other federal agencies.</p>","<p><em>The Barr Foundation is a member of ArtPlace America, a partnership between the National Endowment for the Arts and private foundations focused on creative placemaking in communities across the United States. ArtPlace America and their foundation partners released a statement in response to the recent 2019 Federal budget proposal.</em>  </p>

<p>President Trump has delivered his <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/budget-fy2019.pdf"">budget request</a> to Congress for fiscal year 2019, which proposes significant cuts to and, in some cases, the complete elimination of key federal agencies - like the <a href=""https://www.arts.gov/"">National Endowment for the Arts</a>.  This has the potential both to end valuable direct investments in our local communities and to dismantle tremendous partnerships with philanthropy that have strengthened our country.      </p>

<p>As just one example, in 2011, we were so inspired by work that the National Endowment for the Arts was doing through its <a href=""https://www.arts.gov/exploring-our-town/"">&quot;Our Town&quot;</a> investments that we came together to capitalize <a href=""https://www.artplaceamerica.org/"">ArtPlace America</a>, which exists to extend and build upon the federal government&#39;s work enlisting the arts and culture sector as an ally in creating equitable, healthy, and sustainable communities of all sizes across the country.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--around""> <p>coalesced</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>This partnership - which has invested more than $100 million to date in communities that span the country from <a href=""https://www.artplaceamerica.org/funded-projects/re-locate-kivalina"">Kivalina, AK</a> to <a href=""https://www.artplaceamerica.org/funded-projects?f%5B0%5D=field_grants_projloc_state1%3A116&or=116"">Boston, MA</a>, from <a href=""https://www.artplaceamerica.org/funded-projects/lost-pines-art-center"">Bastrop, TX</a> to <a href=""https://www.artplaceamerica.org/funded-projects/artspace-magic-city-lofts"">Minot, ND</a>- has allowed us an even closer look at what is possible only when private philanthropies have strong and robust partners in the federal government.  </p>

<p>Some seven years ago, it was the then Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts who was able to bring us together as foundation leaders because his agency had a strong history of investing in each of our communities.  He was also able to bring together senior officials from agencies like the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Environmental Protection Agency because he was their peer in federal government.</p>

<p>Together, we have worked more effectively than we could have done alone exactly because the public sector and philanthropy are not meant to do the same thing.</p>

<p>Federal agencies are charged with serving all Americans in every community; no private philanthropy has the resources or the infrastructure to do that.  Foundation dollars are meant to be risk capital; public funding exists to bring tested interventions to scale.  Government is responsive to voters through election cycles; foundations are charged with thinking across longer timelines.</p>

<p>We coalesced around a shared commitment to strengthen local communities.  And, in this case, we came together because we all understood that artists are a resource present in every community.  We also understood that those artists help root us in our communities, help connect us with our neighbors, and help to drive civic participation.  Quite simply, we understood that it is not possible to have strong local communities without having a strong arts and culture sector. </p>

<p>If we lose federal agencies like the National Endowment for the Arts, we will not only lose significant direct investments in communities across all 50 states, we also lose the infrastructure that brings us together as one United States of America.</p>

353,What Does Climate Change Mean for Coastal Communities?,<p>A conversation with Erika Spanger-Siegfried on findings from a landmark report on flood risks and adaptation strategies for coastal communities and the opportunities for climate resilience in Boston and beyond.</p>,"<p>Building awareness of climate impacts, risks, and resilience strategies is crucial to accelerating climate resilience work in our region. That is why Barr is excited to partner with the <a href=""https://www.ucsusa.org/"">Union of Concerned Scientists</a> (UCS) to support analysis, outreach, and policy education on climate change impacts. UCS&#39;s research can help coastal communities better understand sea level rise and how to prepare for it.  Following the recent floods in Boston and hurricanes this past fall, Emily Sidla, Program Associate on the Barr Foundation&#39;s Climate team, sat down to talk with Erika about climate resilience, working with communities, and UCS&#39;s new report.</p>
<h3>1. What did the study set out to do?</h3>
<p>This <a href=""https://www.ucsusa.org/global-warming/global-warming-impacts/when-rising-seas-hit-home-chronic-inundation-from-sea-level-rise#.WoHhQ4JOlTZ"">national study</a> tries to bring a picture into focus of where and when sea level rise will affect us on the U.S. coasts. We&#39;ve already researched the near term, when small floods related to full moon and king tides will increase steeply. And we&#39;ve looked at the late century, when some places will be permanently underwater with daily high tides. But, we were left with the question of how does this change unfold? We know communities aren&#39;t going to wait until their neighborhoods are flooded on a daily basis to act. We want to offer people an idea of specifically where and when chronic, disruptive flooding will arrive.</p>
<h3>2. What was the most surprising finding?</h3>
<p>There were many. But we were struck by how many people are living with chronic flooding today and their coping measures. There are places in Maryland where people keep a &quot;salt water car&quot; and a &quot;regular car,&quot; so that during the frequent flooding days, they can drive the junkbox and not ruin their good car. The number of chronically inundated communities expected in just the next couple of decades was a surprise. And the extent of chronic inundation - the land area that would basically become limited use zones - gets big, fast in many communities. I was surprised to learn how much of the Greater Boston area will be chronically inundated later this century. But we need to get started on actual adaptation actions now - I would love to see Boston take the lead on these groundbreaking efforts.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--places""> <p>are</p> </blockquote></p>
<h3>3. Who is the most vulnerable to climate change impacts?</h3>
<p>Both wealthy and struggling coastal communities can be highly exposed to flooding. The important distinction is how vulnerable these places are when flooding happens. It&#39;s well-documented that low income and communities of color have a harder time bouncing back to their original footing than wealthier communities. As communities rebuild from extreme events, it&#39;s crucial that we do not settle for simply returning to the status quo of systemic inequity. We need to be building stronger, healthier communities for all.</p>
<h3>4. How can communities be proactive?</h3>
<p>There&#39;s no simple recipe for building community resilience, but there are things to avoid and basic approaches to pursue. We&#39;ve created <a href=""https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2016/06/climate-resilience-framework-and-principles.pdf"">a set of adaptation principles</a>, for example, that outline best practices and pitfalls to avoid. For example, we think starting with commitments to sound climate science and equity are key, ensuring that the costs of responding to climate change and the benefits of resilience-building are equitably shared. This also means that groups or communities affected by climate resilience decisions should be directly involved in shaping those decisions.</p>
<h3>5. What are the benefits for communities that embrace climate resilience?</h3>
<p>Getting out ahead of this problem is the biggest benefit. We hope coastal communities will use this information and their time wisely to adapt. The bottom line for coastal communities is that flooding is going to increase in frequency and magnitude, but if you start now, you can be on a path to adapt to 3, 4, 5 feet of sea level rise later this century. </p>
<h3>6. The report talks about the need to halt or phase out current policies that increase risk. What does this mean?</h3>
<p>So, maladaptive practices are short-sighted things we are doing today that maintain or worsen our climate risks, or create altogether new ones. Common examples are when municipalities allow building permits in flood-prone areas or when sea level rise disclosure isn’t required in real estate transactions. In many places, maladaptive practices are the law of the land. Rooting out these practices would be a major advance for more resilient communities. </p>
<h3>7. Recent floods in Boston and severe hurricanes this past fall are a stark reminder that climate impacts are here. Since some of the communities hit by hurricanes were part of UCS&#39;s report, do you have any new reflections to share?</h3>
<p>Extreme events can be terrible accelerators of change. But, if we are ahead of the curve, they can be moments to build back stronger and better - if not always in the same way or even in the precise same place. For example in Texas, the policies don&#39;t exist to support rebuilding in that way. Maybe these events and the reckoning that could come with insurance prices next year will end up mobilizing support for such policies and resources at the federal level. Pre-disaster investment and other resilience building investment save money, not to mention lives.</p>

<h3>8. If you had a magic wand, what new actions or policies would you want to see take place in our region?</h3>
<p>I&#39;m originally from Salem, Massachusetts and I&#39;ve lived most of my life on the North Shore, and my favorite places are all on the water. I would use my magic wand to give people and nature in these places a chance to keep up with the changes coming our way. To give coastal marshes and other ecosystems the chance to keep up with rising seas. And to give us the vision and commitment to create a resilient region that is changed, by necessity, but in many ways for the better. The good news is that we are truly in a position to do this work well.</p>

352,Luck is Not a Strategy for Climate Change,<p>Last month's Nor'easter was an urgent reminder of the work still left to be done to prepare Boston for climate change.</p>,"<p>Boston and Massachusetts have climate goals that are among the most ambitious in the United States, yet climate change is a global challenge, with some impacts already evident and likely to worsen. These include sea level rise and far more severe weather than usual – such as our extreme drought in 2016, the record snowfall of over 108 inches in 2015, or the extreme and unprecedented flooding during the January 4  Nor’easter.</p>

<p>The City of Boston’s <a href=""https://www.boston.gov/departments/environment/climate-ready-boston"">climate ready initiative</a> has identified how these changes can be expected to manifest in the city. By 2050, the city projects average summer temperatures in Boston to be as sweltering as they are in present-day Washington, DC. Meanwhile, Boston Harbor is projected to add eight inches of water by 2030 and as much as 1.5 feet by 2050.</p>

<p>To its credit, the City of Boston is working diligently to translate the climate ready data into useful actions, with <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/from-planning-to-action-preparing-boston-for-a-changing-climate"">projects underway</a> in particularly vulnerable neighborhoods such as East Boston and Charlestown. However, there are ample opportunities to do more to make Boston climate resilient, and for the city to serve as a model for other cities facing similar challenges.</p>

<p>Progress will depend on continued leadership from across the Commonwealth, from city and town halls as well as business and nonprofit board rooms, and from engaged residents. Recognizing this urgent need and opportunity, the Barr Foundation <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/barr-foundation-expands-climate-program"">last month announced</a> the addition of climate resilience as a third focus area of its seven-year-old climate program, and the Foundation intends to commit $5 million of new grantmaking to this work in 2018. Our new focus will include three strategies: building greater awareness of climate impact risks and resilience strategies; mobilizing key constituencies to advance and implement effective policies and regulations; and supporting demonstration projects that will transform Boston into a model of urban resilience and point the way for other municipalities.</p>

<p>Following Hurricane Sandy five years ago, we heard frequently how Boston got lucky. Had that storm hit just five hours sooner, it would have devastated the city and other coastal communities. But luck is not a strategy. As the January 4 flooding made abundantly clear, we must act now, investing in well-researched, innovative, and sharply-focused efforts to protect our region from flood risks, extreme weather, and other climate impacts.</p>

<p>These impacts aren’t merely future possibilities generated by climate models. They are already evident and demand urgent action and tangible steps to ensure our region is prepared 365 days of the year.</p>

351,What Are My Options for Boston Schools?,"<p>New website profiles every school in Boston, giving parents easy access to the information they care about most.</p>","<p>For years, finding the best school option for your child in Boston has been challenging and overwhelming. Between Boston Public Schools, charter schools, parochial schools, and private schools, there are many different choices, but also many different sources of information, and many decisions to make. Something as simple as identifying which schools serve 6th graders, or how to enroll in each school, required visiting multiple websites and sorting through all of the information. To help address this challenge, Barr recently provided a grant to <a href=""http://www.bostonschoolsfund.org/"">Boston Schools Fund</a> to develop and launch <a href=""http://www.bostonschoolfinder.org/"">Boston School Finder</a>. This new web-based tool includes information on all schools in Boston (district, charter, parochial, and private) to help inform parents and students of the school options, and empower them in the school selection process.</p>

<p>Barr&#39;s <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/education-boston"">Boston Strategy</a> within its Education Program has a goal of expanding access to quality K-12 seats across the city. Achieving this goal can include both increasing the quality of the schools, and helping parents and students access the schools that are best suited for them. Boston School Finder helps get at that second component - improving access.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2165/small.jpg?1642122758 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2165/medium.jpg?1642122758 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2165/large.jpg?1642122758 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2165/x_large.jpg?1642122758 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""A screen capture of Boston School Finder&#39;s homepage.

<p>We were very excited about the potential impact of this tool, because of how parents informed Boston Schools Fund&#39;s research, development, and testing. Through polls, surveys, focus groups, and one-on-one interviews with parents, Boston Schools Fund strived to understand how parents in Boston choose schools and what information and resources they value to make that choice.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--Fund""> <p>Schools</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>They found that families valued a variety of information, but were missing a way to look at that information across all schools in one place, allowing them to evaluate the range of options for themselves. Boston School Finder is a response to that need. It includes information on all schools in Boston (district, charter, parochial, and private), is available in eight languages, and is free for everyone. It uses publicly available information, and does not evaluate or rank schools. It also strives to be easy to use by incorporating a searchable database with consistent school profile formats.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Boston School Finder brings equity to the types of information families want, and families feel empowered by this information&quot; - Parent Ambassador, Boston School Finder</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Barr believes in the importance of working collaboratively across the education landscape, as well as with elected officials and the private sector, towards a common goal. We are excited that Boston School Finder is an example of a public-private partnership that includes support from throughout the community. Boston Public Schools, charter, parochial, and private schools all contributed school-specific information and links to enrollment and applications processes. Boston based e-commerce company, Wayfair, provided in-kind support to build the website and the searchable tool. And over 75 civic and community groups, including City Hall, helped shape and contribute to the effort as well.</p>

<p>We believe there is a lot that can be learned as Boston School Finder is rolled out and utilized by families. The data collected on the usage of the tool and feedback from parents will improve the site, and better inform the public on why and how families choose schools.  Subsequently, this could inform decision-making across the city and improve the support provided to parents and families. We encourage you to explore Boston School Finder and <a href=""http://bostonschoolfinder.org/about/contact"">provide your feedback</a>.</p>

350,Barr Foundation Announces Creative Commonwealth Initiative,"<p>In partnership with five community foundations, Barr launches new $3 million initiative to strengthen arts and creativity across Massachusetts.</p>","<p>At the Barr Foundation, we believe arts and creativity are essential for thriving communities. In 2016, when we expanded our Arts &amp; Creativity program to all of Massachusetts, we knew we would need to identify partners across the state with deep knowledge and relationships in various communities. That is why we are excited to announce the Creative Commonwealth Initiative.</p>

<p>A partnership with five community foundations - <a href=""https://www.berkshiretaconic.org/default.aspx"">Berkshire Taconic Community Foundation</a>, <a href=""https://www.cfsema.org/"">Community Foundation of Southeastern Massachusetts</a>, <a href=""http://communityfoundation.org/"">Community Foundation of Western Massachusetts</a>, <a href=""http://eccf.org/"">Essex County Community Foundation</a> and <a href=""http://www.greaterworcester.org/"">Greater Worcester Community Foundation</a> - Creative Commonwealth is rooted in our shared belief that artists and arts organizations inspire, challenge, and bring our communities together. Yet, in Massachusetts, depending on geography, art form, or networks, access to funding is uneven - and so are opportunities to experience arts and creativity. Though Massachusetts has thousands of artists and cultural organizations, philanthropic support also tends to be unevenly distributed. Creative Commonwealth aims to address these challenges.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2159/small.jpg?1642122734 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2159/medium.jpg?1642122734 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2159/large.jpg?1642122734 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2159/x_large.jpg?1642122734 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""A map of Massachusetts, detailing the five regions where Creative Commonwealth will impact."" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2159/small.jpg?1642122734"" /> </div> </div></p>

<p>Community foundations have an important platform to generate new opportunities in their communities, and to connect donors and policymakers with artists and arts organizations to support their creative work. As those connections deepen, people across Massachusetts access more creative experiences that represent the rich diversity of our communities, and funding for creative work can become more equitable and sustainable.</p>

<p>Barr is investing $500,000 over two years for each Creative Commonwealth partner to pilot and implement new initiatives that emerged from community-driven planning efforts funded by Barr in 2017. Each community foundation will launch a portfolio of strategies and activities comprised of grants, knowledge and skill-building activities, and platforms for connecting. In addition, we have awarded $300,000 to the Community Foundation of Western Massachusetts to facilitate opportunities for the Creative Commonwealth partners to share strategies and lessons learned with each other and the broader field. All together, Barr&#39;s investment in Creative Commonwealth totals nearly $3 million.</p>

<p>We hope you&#39;ll follow along and support this significant new endeavor to strengthen arts and creativity across the Commonwealth, and the varied and remarkable regional initiatives of our partners.

347,"In a Funding Portfolio, Diversity Drives Impact",<p>Five lessons from a partnership between the Barr Foundation and Community Labor United.</p>,"<p>At the Barr Foundation, many of our longest partnerships are with community-based organizations, some of which are led by people of color. Grounded in our belief that solutions reside with those we serve, we invest in leaders who drive change from the bottom up. This funding approach is inspired not only by an attentiveness to diversity, equity, and inclusion, but also by a conviction that diversity in our funding portfolio is an imperative for impact.</p>

<p>I recently had the opportunity to explore these ideas in a webinar titled &quot;Diversifying Your Portfolio: Funding Through the Lens of Racial Equity and Social Justice.&quot; The webinar was sponsored by Biodiversity Funders Group and Environmental Grantmakers Association, and was part of <a href=""https://www.indeepinitiative.org"">InDEEP</a> a professional development series for environmental philanthropy practitioners. I was joined by <a href=""http://massclu.org/"">Community Labor United</a> executive director, Darlene Lombos, who is a member of the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/introducing-2017-barr-fellows"">newest class of Barr Fellows</a>, and whose organization Barr has been supporting for over a decade. The following is adapted from my remarks, in conversation with Darlene.</p>

<p>Community Labor United brings together some of the strongest base-building community organizations and unions to build strategic campaigns to protect and promote the interests of low- and middle-income working families in the region. When Barr started funding the organization, we still had a very broad environmental sustainability program, with one line of funding directly targeted towards environmental justice. </p>

<p>In 2010, Barr made a shift to focus on climate change, and my piece of the portfolio became clean energy. While we no longer describe environmental justice as a standalone funding area, I continue to see an important role for organizations like Community Labor United. The transition to a clean energy economy requires broad public support, including diverse voices from across varied communities that work to ensure that all communities benefit from clean energy. Just as important is the consideration that groups like Community Labor United have the experience and credibility necessary to reach decision makers across the state.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--to""> <p>transition</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Barr’s first grant to Community Labor United under its new climate strategy was for planning that ultimately helped catalyze the Green Justice Coalition, a network of community-based organizations that work together to build a broader base of support for a sustainable and equitable clean energy economy.</p>

<p>Through its effective campaign and constituency-building skills, the Green Justice Coalition was able to cultivate broader support for clean energy policies both at the state level and local levels. It successfully worked to expand access to energy efficiency programs, and improve wages and conditions for workers, earning the respect of the energy industry as well as policymakers. Green Justice Coalition members have <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/frame-shift-then-power-shift"">led efforts to replace coal powered plants with clean energy</a>, and organized local ordinances to fix gas leaks and implement community choice energy. The Green Justice Coalition has also been instrumental in <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/boston-interfaith-community-solar-project"">engaging African American and Latino elected officials to support clean energy solutions</a>.</p>
<h3>In reflecting on this longstanding partnership, I offer four key takeaways:</h3>
<p><strong>1. Broadening a grant portfolio to invest in community-based organizations allows you to access the talent, networks and leadership needed to achieve important wins.</strong> We have been able to achieve key policy outcomes because of the leadership–and engaged membership–of frontline organizations.  </p>

<p><strong>2. Progress depends on taking a long-term view, investing for the long term, and being patient.</strong> Coalitions take time to organize, especially those that are committed to building power and leadership in the community and ensuring that community voices are authentically represented. All of this work–the education, the consensus building, the development of strategies–take time.  Therefore, the funding cannot be episodic. We need to recognize the importance of investing over several years regardless of what the “campaign” is, in order to build a durable movement that can work on a range of issues.</p>

<p><strong>3. Know that circumstances and needs will change, and be responsive.</strong> There was a period when the coalition struggled to take advantage of opportunities to exercise its collective power. Because of the trust we had built, we were able to work together to pinpoint the challenges, and provided support to help the Green Justice Coalition refocus its strategy from the bottom up.</p>

<p><strong>4. Demonstrate that community-based leadership and engagement are critical to impact.</strong> Green Justice Coalition members are now leaders on clean energy and the climate field writ large, and have played a vital role advancing clean energy policies. Their presence in the debate has also spurred collaborations across the sector, resulting in other organizations recognizing the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion to their own agendas. While it is heartening to see these positive changes, the field–including funders–still has a long way to go in making diversity, equity, and inclusion a priority. In the years ahead, I will look for ways to help move this agenda forward.</p>

<p>The current national context of unrelenting policy rollbacks on environmental protections and climate action, along with attacks on immigrants and communities of color, presents a very challenging environment for many nonprofits. Now, more than ever, we must demonstrate and increase our commitment to the principles of inclusion, equity, and opportunity through our grantmaking, and in the other ways that we support all of our partners. </p>

346,The Arts Mean Business in Massachusetts,<p>Celebrating new research demonstrating the impact of the creative economy.</p>,"<p>Last fall, government, business, arts, and philanthropic leaders gathered at the downtown Boston headquarters of Sonos to celebrate and raise awareness about our region’s “creative economy.” Building on findings of new research released in 2017 by <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/new-england-creative-economy-jobs-employment-data"">New England Foundation for the Arts</a> and <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/arts-mean-business-new-report-shows-economic-impact-of-arts-in-us"">Americans for the Arts</a>, the event recognized that arts and creativity are significant economic drivers in cities and towns across Massachusetts and throughout New England. And it launched the <a href=""https://twitter.com/search?vertical=default&q=%23ArtsMeansBiz&src=typd"">#ArtsMeansBiz</a> hashtag to invite further engagement and discussion.</p>

<p>The American for the Arts research focused on arts and culture nonprofits, and how they and their audiences generate earnings for residents, business, and communities. It analyzed statewide data, as well as city-specific data from Boston, Cambridge, Lowell, Medfield, Springfield, and Worcester (several of whom will also be hosting their own #ArtsMeansBiz events in the coming weeks and months). The New England Foundation for the Arts research used an even wider lens, to better understand the broader impact of the region’s creative economy – a concept Barr President Jim Canales broke down in <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/arts-means-business-recognizing-the-power-and-potential-of-our-creative-economy"">his remarks</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“[The creative economy] is not just comprised of those who create art or those who work at arts institutions, although they are an important part of this story. Today, the creative economy includes many people working at desks right here at Sonos and around the corner at an ad agency. It includes people who are self-employed and those who are entrepreneurs, web designers, jewelers, music teachers and many others.&quot;</p>

344,Barr’s New Climate Resilience Strategies,"<p>Climate Program Co-Directors Mariella Puerto and Mary Skelton Roberts outline the rationale, priorities, and early steps of the Foundation’s newly-expanded focus on resilience.</p>","<p>After Hurricane Sandy, many noted that Boston got lucky. Had that storm hit our region five hours sooner, at high tide, the scenes of devastation from Atlantic City, Breezy Point, or Lower Manhattan would likely have been East Boston, Dorchester, and Charlestown. And, as we experienced with <a href=""https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2018/01/04/flooding-boston-coastal-neighborhoods-takes-residents-surprise/JJjsAkOoP6QTV5d6j8UsbL/story.html"">yesterday’s Nor’easter</a>, bringing extreme and unprecedented flooding to Boston and up and down the coast, we cannot afford to continue depending on luck alone. We have a rare and urgent opportunity to protect this region from flood risks, extreme heat, and other climate impacts before, not after, we find ourselves in the crosshairs of the next super storm.</p>

<p>In December, <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/barr-foundation-expands-climate-program"">Barr President Jim Canales announced</a> the addition of Climate Resilience as a third focus area of Barr’s Climate program. He also shared the three initial strategies that will focus our efforts. Here, we provide further commentary on the rationale for these strategies, our funding priorities under each of them, and how we intend to approach this first year of expanded grantmaking. </p>
<h3>Strategy #1: Build Awareness of Climate Impacts, Risks, and Resilience Strategies.</h3>
<p>When cities face major climate-related events like hurricanes, wildfires, or heat waves, it can generate public and political will for action on climate resilience. Metro Boston is in the fortunate position of being able to prepare itself before such events occur. Yet, the urgency for action in our region is not yet widespread. Much needs to be done to build understanding of how vulnerable we are, how climate change can impact different communities in different ways, and what the best strategies are to increase our resilience. We recognize that for diverse constituencies to prioritize resilience, strategies to address climate vulnerabilities must be reflective of their values and priorities. To do this, we will: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Strengthen the development of data and research</strong> that informs solutions that are equitable, relevant, timely and actionable. And, support research that highlights the connections between greater resilience and health, safety, economic opportunity, and other co-benefits that are important to communities.<br></li>
<li><strong>Increase public awareness and engagement</strong> through the use of interactive experiences such as apps, charrettes, and other opportunities that engage residents. </li>
<li><strong>Develop and disseminate value propositions</strong> (“why this matters to me”) that engage key stakeholders, including low-income and communities of color.<br></li>
</ul>
<h3>Strategy #2: Mobilize key constituencies to advance policy and implement resilience plans.</h3>
<p>We believe when diverse constituencies are mobilized and collaborating across sectors to create common agendas for action, it accelerates policy change. In the interest of mobilizing and supporting coordinated action, our grantmaking will include the following three priorities:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Strengthen leadership development and capacity</strong> of communities to inform local and regional climate-resilience planning, policy development, and implementation.<br></li>
<li><strong>Support professional networks</strong> of real estate developers, architects, landscapers, engineers, planners, and healthcare providers to encourage them to incorporate resilience into their work.<br></li>
<li><strong>Support advocacy organizations</strong> in their efforts to advance effective local and state-level resilience policies and regulations, and to ensure they are well implemented.<br></li>
</ul>
<h3>Strategy #3: Support Demonstration Projects that Integrate Resilience into the Fabric of Cities.</h3>
<p>Climate resilience is most effective when it is integrated into all capital and infrastructure projects. To get there, we need tangible examples of resilient solutions that serve to protect our most vulnerable residents.  At Barr, we believe one of philanthropy’s most important functions is to invest in demonstration projects that other municipalities can replicate. Our priorities for this third strategy are to:  </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Transform Metro Boston into a model of urban resilience</strong> with real policies and district-scale resilience solutions. Such solutions can be tailored to meet the needs of geographically-targeted areas and integrated into local initiatives in ways that also advance co-benefits (e.g., provide access to quality green space and reduce air pollution). Examples could include creation of new overlays such as Heat Overlay Districts and Flood Protection Overlay Districts.</li>
<li><strong>Integrate Resilience into Capital Project Planning.</strong> Billions are spent annually on capital projects without consideration of how those projects could also be more climate resilient.  We will look for strategic opportunities that help municipalities integrate climate resilience into their existing and new capital projects.<br></li>
<li><strong>Support the use of green infrastructure</strong> and other natural systems that manage storm water, mitigate heat and provide co-benefits to communities.<br></li>
</ul>
<h3>Resilience Priorities for 2018</h3>
<p>In 2018, we will hire a new program officer who will oversee this expanded body of work. We expect our initial grantmaking to focus on initiatives and partners with whom we have already been engaged – such as <a href=""https://www.boston.gov/departments/environment/climate-ready-boston"">Climate Ready Boston</a>, the <a href=""http://www.greenribboncommission.org/"">Green Ribbon Commission</a>, and <a href=""https://www.mapc.org/our-work/expertise/climate/mmc/"">MAPC’s Metro Mayor’s Coalition</a>. We may also support grantees in our Clean Energy and Mobility portfolios who have the capacity to integrate resilience into their ongoing efforts. We also have an interest in identifying new partners and opportunities beyond our current engagements and networks and will explore ways to solicit new ideas.

343,Time for Aspiration for Mobility in Massachusetts,"<p>Reflections on the urgency, and possibility of dramatic change in Massachusetts’ transportation system in 2018 and beyond.</p>","<p>When it comes to our transportation system, Massachusetts is making progress. But with profound challenges ahead, we need to unite behind fundamental and dramatic changes.</p>

<p>At the Barr Foundation, our mission is to invest in potential, to take the long-term view, and to aspire to big change. And, though the challenges are many, so too are reasons for hope. We are regularly inspired by our grantees’ and other stakeholders’ efforts to improve mobility and access to the region’s economic and cultural resources. In 2017, we saw bold transportation plans hatched and communities embrace new ideas, like streetscape improvements and expanded greenways. We also saw municipalities willing to improve bus commutes with <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/riding-the-bus-is-about-to-get-better-for-30000-commuters"">pilots projects to test elements of Bus Rapid Transit</a>. </p>

<p>Yet, as the new year approaches, one can’t help but be concerned about some profound shifts barreling toward us. The largest, without question, is climate change. We are also contending with rapid and significant shifts in the state’s population and economy, with Greater Boston experiencing surging growth that’s stretching housing stock and infrastructure to its limits. Simultaneously, changes in technology loom large as we plunge headlong into what many are calling the “three revolutions” in transportation—automation, electrification, and vehicle sharing. As Zipcar founder and former CEO, <a href=""https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2014/04/will-world-driverless-cars-be-heaven-or-hell/8784/"">Robin Chase has cautioned</a>, advances in technology like driverless cars could create “heaven or hell” when it comes to mobility and carbon emissions. So, we need to follow these developments closely and remain actively engaged. Hoping for heaven is not a strategy.</p>

<p>What does this mean for Massachusetts? We are at an important inflection point, and must do more than simply keep up our current, steady state of progress and improvement. While Massachusetts ranks first in the country for its education and medical institutions, <a href=""https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/infrastructure/transportation"">for transportation, we near the bottom -  at 45</a>. We’ve got to accelerate and get ahead, or we risk watching our economy wither along with our aging infrastructure.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--the""> <p>in</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>It’s not an easy task, with budgetary and political challenges, and a debate that has, unhelpfully, gotten stuck, framing transportation as a Greater Boston vs. the rest of the state issue. Future progress will require us to change that frame, recognizing the interconnectedness of our state’s entire transportation system, and that investments in the MBTA both in and beyond Greater Boston are investments that pay dividends in local economies throughout our Commonwealth.</p>

<p>We also need to confront some difficult realities and acknowledge deep economic disparities in our state. Too many have been left behind when it comes to infrastructure investments, access to jobs and opportunities, great neighborhoods, and the benefits of economic growth. Most notably, people of color have suffered <a href=""https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/12/11/that-was-typo-the-median-net-worth-black-bostonians-really/ze5kxC1jJelx24M3pugFFN/story.html"">diminished mobility and access to economic opportunities</a>. And we need to be attentive both to urban and rural communities that are not connected to Massachusetts’ abundant educational, health, and economic resources.</p>

<p>How can we overcome these challenges for the good of all in this state? The Barr Foundation certainly doesn’t have all the answers. Yet, we believe that finding the right pathways will depend on honoring the needs and priorities of individuals in communities. A new, faster, more efficient, more equitable, more sustainable mobility future will be shaped by broad and deep public engagement, and be characterized by solutions that meet the needs of residents today, while creating flexibility for the future.</p>

<p>For 2018 and beyond, our aspiration is for a transportation system that provides connection and access for all to the resources that allow us to live happy and prosperous lives. It means our health and safety, and security for the next generation. It means not spending hours stuck in traffic or on delayed, broken-down trains or busses. And, it means travelling in ways that don’t further degrade our environment and climate. And, for all of us in Massachusetts, its our move to bring this potential into being.</p>

342,From Planning to Action: Preparing Boston for a Changing Climate ,"<p>Mia Mansfield, program manager for the City of Boston’s Climate Ready Boston initiative, talks about the findings, next steps, and key lessons from Boston’s most recent climate resilience report.</p>","<p>The <a href=""https://www.boston.gov/sites/default/files/20161207_climate_ready_boston_digital2.pdf"">Climate Ready Boston report</a> came out one year ago and laid out a roadmap for how the City can begin tackling the significant impacts it is projected to face due to climate change. This fall, the City released the first set of neighborhood coastal resilience plans that kick off its implementation. In our <a href=""https://www.boston.gov/sites/default/files/climatereadyeastbostoncharlestown_finalreport_web.pdf"">“Coastal Resilience Solutions for East Boston and Charlestown”</a> report, supported by the MA Office of Coastal Zone Management and the Barr Foundation, we set out to better understand the specific flood risks these neighborhoods face, how those risks change over time, the short-term actions the City can take to protect residents, and the long-term vision for coastal resilience.</p>

<p>We started in East Boston and Charlestown because these neighborhoods face significant flood risk already, and their flood pathways are few and well-defined. We worked with the Neighborhood of Affordable Housing in East Boston, and a Steering Committee of many City and State agencies. As a direct result of the plan, <a href=""https://www.boston.gov/news/city-take-immediate-steps-protect-east-boston-charlestown-climate-change"">Mayor Walsh announced immediate steps</a> to reduce flood vulnerabilities in these two neighborhoods. In hindsight, what enabled this swift action was its focus on four key principles:</p>
<h3>1. Get clear and specific about risks.</h3>
<p>We now better understand the detailed flood risks these neighborhoods face over time. In East Boston, the low-lying Greenway serves as the current and primary flood pathway through the neighborhood. A second but equally important flood pathway along Border Street comes into play with an additional 9 inches of sea level rise (projected around 2030). In Charlestown, the primary flood pathway comes through low-lying land behind the Schrafft’s Building where it is channeled to the neighborhood.</p>

<h3>2. Focus on co-benefits.</h3>
<p>We identified specific actions we can take that work—not only to reduce flood risk, but also to bring many additional benefits to the neighborhoods. In both neighborhoods, the long-term coastal resilience vision is centered on redesigning the waterfronts to meet certain elevation targets while increasing green space, recreation opportunities, and access to the water.</p>
<h3>3. Identify and invest in demonstration projects.</h3>
<p>Mayor Walsh announced immediate steps to install a deployable floodwall across the East Boston Greenway, and incorporate flood resilience into the Sullivan Square Redesign project in Charlestown. These projects mean several million dollars in dedicated funding to Climate Ready Boston implementation and show the possibility of moving climate resilience from an abstract concept to a real project, coordinating across planning processes, and laying the groundwork for bigger and more complicated action in the future.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2106/small.jpg?1642122037 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2106/medium.jpg?1642122037 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2106/large.jpg?1642122037 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2106/x_large.jpg?1642122037 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""A map of Charlestown from a birds eye view."" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2106/small.jpg?1642122037"" /> <div class=""FancyAttribution""> <p><a class=""FancyAttribution-link"" href=""https://www.boston.gov/departments/environment/climate-ready-boston"">Climate Ready Boston</a></p> </div> </div> <div class=""Media-caption""> <p>Coastal</p> </div> </div>    </p>
<h3>4. Community partnership is key.</h3>
<p>Our partnership with neighborhood groups like Neighborhood of Affordable Housing was critical to reaching more residents, getting feedback to the design team, and developing recommendations better aligned with community interests. We are working to improve community engagement across Climate Ready Boston. Last summer, we launched a community engagement initiative called “Climate Ready Boston Leaders”  that trained 70 residents on Climate Ready Boston findings, and provided small grants to host community meetings and conversations on climate resilience. These Leaders reached over 500 residents through their events, and in January we’ll be recruiting our next cohort.</p>

<p><strong>So, what’s next?</strong> In all of this work, our aim is to continue making Boston more resilient to climate change. Climate Ready South Boston is already underway, and the Moakley Park Vision Plan (in partnership with the Boston Parks and Recreation Department) will kick off this winter. Both projects present more opportunities to build climate resilience in ways that also create more accessible waterfronts, better parks and open space, stronger community partnerships, and safer neighborhoods for Boston.</p>

<p>And there’s more. The BPDA recently updated their Climate Resilience and Preparedness Checklist, that asks developers how they are preparing for 40’’ of sea level rise, and provides a Flood Hazard Area mapping tool with future flood elevations at the parcel level. And for the first time, the City announced a capital budget authorization for climate resilience planning.</p>

<p>As you can see, it’s been a big year with momentum building to keep this work moving forward. Climate resilience is an urgent and long-term issue for Boston, and progress depends on people from across the city getting engaged.

341,Barr Foundation Expands Climate Program,"<p>With an initial $5 million commitment for 2018, Barr Foundation adds climate resilience as a third priority of its Climate program.</p>","<blockquote>
<p><em>“Every day, little by little, the water is rising, washing away beaches, eroding coastlines, pushing into homes and shops and places of worship. As our world floods, it is likely to cause immense suffering and devastation. It is also likely to bring people together and inspire creativity and camaraderie in ways that no one can foresee. Either way, the water is coming.”</em> </p>

<p>-Jeff Goodell, <em>The Water Will Come</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Each year, Boston becomes more vulnerable to the effects of a changing climate. We know this from the <a href=""https://www.boston.gov/departments/environment/climate-ready-boston"">Climate Ready Boston</a> research commissioned by the City of Boston. Moreover, the extreme weather events of 2017 in California, Florida, Texas, and the Caribbean only underscore the scale of the challenges before us, the urgency for action, and the many opportunities Greater Boston has to prepare for rising seas and other climate impacts.</p>

<p>As Jeff Goodell argues in his highly acclaimed new book, <em>The Water Will Come</em>, this moment calls for us to embrace creativity, to invest in smart and sustainable solutions and, most importantly, to come together to address the challenge of a changing climate. </p>

<p>Since the Barr Foundation’s inception, one of our key priorities has been the environment. In 2010, we sharpened this work with a focus on climate change.  Initially making a five-year, $50 million commitment, as we close 2017, Barr has awarded over $120 million in support of this vital work.</p>

<p>Through these years, Barr’s principal attention has been on reducing emissions from their two largest sources: transportation and energy. Yet, even as we have sought to mitigate the most harmful impacts of climate change, we have also recognized that many of those impacts are inevitable. As a result, over the last two years, we supported an exploratory pilot in climate preparedness.</p>

<p>Based on what we have learned from that effort, the Barr Foundation trustees recently authorized an expansion and deepening of this work. Beginning with an initial investment of $5 million in 2018, climate resilience will join clean energy and mobility as a third priority for Barr’s climate program. We intend for this to remain a key focus area for years to come, with the goal of integrating our efforts across clean energy, mobility, and resilience as mitigation strategies often result in greater resiliency as well.</p>

<p>This commitment manifests our own sense of urgency as well as a conviction that deepening and extending Barr’s investments in climate resiliency efforts is vital at this time. With uncertainty about the federal government’s commitment to climate action, cities around the country are stepping up to provide leadership. </p>

<p>The City of Boston, via its Climate Ready Boston initiative, has identified specific strategies to address the City’s vulnerabilities. And while the planning conducted as part of this effort represents a solid start, much more remains to be done as plans shift to execution.</p>

<p>Barr’s goal in this work is to ensure that climate resilience is integrated and institutionalized across various sectors, such that it becomes an essential consideration in how we plan for the future, how we build new and adapt existing buildings and infrastructure, how we create open space in ways that the public can enjoy while also protecting us from sea level rise, and how we engage all communities—especially those most vulnerable—in addressing this challenge.</p>

<p>With an initial focus on the City of Boston and the potential to expand to other parts of Metro Boston, Barr’s initial three strategies aim to:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Build awareness</strong> of climate impacts, risks, and resilience strategies.</li>
<li><strong>Mobilize key constituencies</strong> to advance policy and implement resilience plans.</li>
<li><strong>Support demonstration projects</strong> that integrate resilience into the fabric of our cities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mariella Puerto and Mary Skelton Roberts, co-directors of Barr&#39;s Climate Team, will soon share more information about our Resilience strategies, including when and how potential partners can best propose project ideas for us to consider. We will also soon launch a search for a Program Officer to help lead this new area of work. If you are interested in receiving these and other updates, please sign up below.</p>

<p>We often observe that philanthropy has the privilege of taking a long-term view. That privilege also carries with it an obligation to ensure that we remain attentive to threats and challenges that may seem far away but, if ignored, can have perilous consequences for future generations.</p>

<p>There is perhaps no greater challenge to the future of Boston today than the impacts of climate change, such as increased precipitation, extreme heat and drought, and sea level rise. The water will indeed come, and the question is, will we be sufficiently prepared for it? We are confident that if Greater Boston focuses on this challenge now—across all sectors and with each of us doing our part—we will be prepared.</p>

<p>The Barr Foundation is in. We look forward to joining with and expanding the range of partners and allies engaged in this important work.</p>

339,"Riding the Bus Is About to Get Better for 30,000 Commuters","<p>Arlington, Everett, and Cambridge in partnership with Watertown, receive $100,000 grants to demonstrate BRT’s potential.</p>","<p>Since Barr first began exploring Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) in 2013, one question has remained in sharp focus: will Massachusetts embrace the transformative potential of BRT to make commuting by bus more efficient, reliable and convenient?</p>

<p>To help answer that question, Barr issued a <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/a-call-for-cities-to-lead-the-way-to-better-transit"">request for proposals</a> earlier this year, calling on municipalities to lead the way to better transit. And, earlier this week, we were thrilled to announce that four communities answered that call in a big way.</p>

<p>At the LivableStreets Alliance’s annual <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/StreetTalk10in1?src=hash"">StreetTalk 10-in-1</a> event, Barr, along with our partners from the BostonBRT initiative, announced three $100,000 grants awarded to pilot projects in Arlington, Everett, and Cambridge/Watertown. The municipalities will work in partnership with the MBTA, and in the case of Cambridge and Watertown, across city boundaries, to bring this work into its next critical phase: actually testing ideas on-the-ground to see how they improve the transit experience for thousands of riders.</p>

<p class=""tyler"">Read Jim Canales’ remarks announcing these grants<a href=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/190/attachments/JimCanales_BRTRemarks12.5.17.pdf?1512591627%22%5D"">https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/190/attachments/JimCanales_BRTRemarks12.5.17.pdf?1512591627&quot;]</a></p>

<p>Massachusetts residents deserve a transit system that is efficient, reliable, and equitable while contributing to long-term resiliency in a period of climate change. These BRT pilots offer the opportunity to test elements of what world-class places have every day.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -aside -left""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img alt=""BosBRT Local Pilots"" class=""Media-image"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1983/crop_preview.jpg?1642121684"" /> </div> </div></p>

<p>And at Barr, we hope that these trial runs spark interest from more municipalities to test – and implement – BRT elements to improve the bus experience, with the ultimate goal of building a network of Gold Standard BRT. We applaud the leadership of these municipalities and believe that together we can help bring to Greater Boston and the entire state of Massachusetts, a transportation system that rivals the best in the world.</p>

338,Because We All Love our Children,"<p>They entered the room as adversaries. They left as partners, committed, for their children’s sake, to solve a pressing climate challenge.</p>","<p>For grassroots advocates, tried and true approaches to creating change include the protest march, the fiery speeches, and the funny-but-pointed signs. In this age of bitter divisions, <a href=""https://www.heetma.org/"">HEET</a> and <a href=""http://www.mothersoutfront.org/"">Mothers Out Front</a> tried something new: meeting face-to-face with the gas utility executives who began as our adversaries, but who became our allies in finding solutions to the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/invisible-elephant-in-climate-room-much-bigger-than-we-thought"">problem of natural gas leaks</a>.</p>

<p>Massachusetts has the second oldest natural gas infrastructure in the country. The gas that leaks from this aging infrastructure is a problem because it’s primarily methane, a remarkably destructive greenhouse gas. This wasted gas—worth about $90 million per year—harms the climate as much as the emissions from all of our stores and businesses in Massachusetts. </p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--gas""> <p>wasted</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Because of a law passed in 2016, the utilities are now mandated to fix the very worst leaks (research shows just 7% of the leaks gush out almost half of all the gas). However in order to fix these leaks, gas personnel had to be able to identify the right leaks—technically a task that’s not easy to do in a reliable and inexpensive way.</p>

<p>Thus, we activists and Boston University Professor <a href=""https://www.bu.edu/earth/people/faculty/nathan-phillips/"">Nathan Phillips</a> approached National Grid, Eversource and Columbia Gas to work with us on a research study to scientifically prove the best identification method. </p>

<p>First, however, we needed to build enough trust for all of us to work together.</p>

<p>In our first meeting, there were three of us, all mothers, from HEET and Mothers Out Front. In the large conference room, we were greeted by three white men in business attire. After we took our seats, I introduced myself, adding, ”I care about methane emissions, because my eldest child was born in the year 2000.  All the scientific predictions of climate change are very easy to translate into how old he’ll be.  In 2030 when he’s 30, in 2050 when he’s 50.  Climate change for me is very personal.”</p>

<p>My two collegues followed with their own introductions, explaining how their love for their children motivated them to take action on climate change. These personal stories were the secret behind Mothers Out Front. While people can argue all day long about gigatons of greenhouse gas, no one can argue with a parent’s love.</p>

<p>After we finished speaking, the president of the company eyed each of us.  He introduced himself and said a few words about his children.  He paused, thoughtful, and shared that his youngest child was worried about climate change too.</p>

<p>This was the moment I first suspected we might be able to succeed. I realized these men wanted to do what was right, for the same reason we wanted to, because of the next generation. For them to agree to our plan, we just needed to make that plan easy to defend within the corporation.  </p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--these""> <p>realized</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>So we did that.  We named a practical common goal—to fix the worst leaks first—as we clearly explained the scope of the study and its partners, what assistance they’d have to give, and how the resulting press would benefit the utility. </p>

<p>The president had many questions but we answered them one at a time. The doubt in his face gradually disappeared.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -aside -left""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img alt=""Three people smile in front of a utilities truck. "" class=""Media-image"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1979/crop_preview.jpg?1642121673"" /> <div class=""FancyAttribution""> <p>Mothers Out Front</p> </div> </div> <div class=""Media-caption""> <p>to</p> </div> </div></p>

<p>This summer, our study ended up scientifically proving a method of identifying the worst leaks.  Meanwhile our constant engagement with the utilities earned their buy-in for enacting that method. And we will be able to check that they are enacting the method well, because the trust we’d all built together helped them to agree to independent verification, data transparency and annual reassessment of methods and results. The result will cut the emissions from gas leaks in half.</p>

<p>This was such an encouraging place to be, just 10 months after that first meeting with the president, where, together, we rediscovered the importance and power of empathy, of really listening to each other, and of trust and respect.</p>

335,"Arts, Culture and Transportation: A Creative Placemaking Field Scan",<p>New analysis bolsters the case for collaboration between arts and transportation to generate innovative solutions to pressing mobility challenges.</p>,"<p>We’re thrilled to announce with our partners at <a href=""http://t4america.org/"">Transportation for America</a> the publication of our most recent field scan: <a href=""http://t4america.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Arts-Culture-Field-Scan.pdf"">Arts, Culture and Transportation: A Creative Placemaking Field Scan</a>.</p>

<p>In looking at who does community planning and development in America’s communities, we have found that our colleagues are generally organized into ten sectors: Agriculture &amp; Food, Economic Development, Education &amp; Youth, Environment &amp; Energy, Housing, Immigration, Public Safety, Transportation, and Workforce Development. As a core part of our research agenda, we are exploring how arts and cultural practitioners are and might become partners in helping to achieve each of these sector’s goals.</p>

<p>This publication is one of several “field scans” that ArtPlace America has commissioned to begin this work. This one, conducted and authored by <a href=""http://t4america.org/"">Transportation for America</a>, seeks to illuminate key priorities for the transportation sector and to provide a framework for understanding the ways that arts and culture can help achieve transportation-specific goals.</p>

<p>Transportation systems can and should be a powerful tool to help people access opportunity, drive economic development, improve health and safety, and build the civic and social capital that binds communities together. Unfortunately, a historic, top-down, technocratic approach to transportation planning and design has failed to achieve these goals for everyone. This has resulted in transportation systems that do not equitably serve communities of color, low-income people, and other disadvantaged communities.</p>

<p><strong>But there’s reason for optimism.</strong></p>

<p>Eager to find a better way, scores of communities are collaborating with artists for new, creative approaches to planning and building new projects and solving pressing transportation challenges. This process known as creative placemaking is unfolding in communities across the country and transportation professionals are eager to know: what are the key trends and best practices?</p>

<p>Arts, Culture and Transportation: A Creative Placemaking Field Scan is a rigorous national examination of creative placemaking in the transportation planning process. Released in partnership with T4A, this new resource identifies ways that transportation professionals can integrate artists to deliver transportation projects more smoothly, improve safety, and build community support.</p>

<p>More information on this field scan is available via our friends at <a href=""http://t4america.org/2017/09/27/introducing-arts-culture-transportation-creative-placemaking-field-scan/"">Transportation for America</a>.</p>

<p><strong>More about the Field Scans:</strong></p>

<p>Each field scan serves as a framing document for a working group tasked with taking the analysis and findings one step further, helping ArtPlace to identify the best practices that warrant formal case studies, key methods for evaluating success, and strategic framing of the material in a way that resonates with people most likely to take up creative placemaking practice in this sector. The field scan is not an end in itself, but an initial inquiry that, together with other field scans, will inform both ArtPlace’s work as well as those working at the intersection of art and community development more broadly.</p>

<p>Each field scan addresses two primary audiences: artists and other arts and cultural practitioners seeking to better understand and collaborate with a particular community development sector (in this case, the transportation sector); and community development practitioners who are interested in how arts and culture partners might further their work. Our ultimate goal is for these two audiences to develop a shared language and a set of mutual goals, so that communities will benefit from these powerful, cross-sector synergies.</p>

334,Developing a New Vision of High School Education,"<p>Dr. Stephen Zrike, Receiver/Superintendent of Holyoke Public Schools, shares lessons from the high school design process that resulted in establishing a new vision for high school education in Holyoke.</p>","<p>In April 2015, the Massachusetts Board of Elementary and Secondary Education voted to designate Holyoke Public Schools as chronically underperforming (Level 5), placing the district in state receivership. I was appointed receiver/superintendent for the district and charged with dramatically improving student outcomes.  </p>

<p>At the high school level, we began to make early changes (e.g., implementation of a 9th grade academy) but knew that these efforts would be insufficient to reach our aspiration to create an excellent high school experience for all students. In a context where there is urgency and pressure that can result in leaping to solutions too soon or sticking with incremental changes, we decided to take a different route. To reach our goals, we committed to a deep design process with extensive local stakeholder engagement. Earlier this year, we unveiled a bold new strategic plan to further our goal of providing an excellent high school experience for all of Holyoke’s students. The plan frames a new vision for high school education in the district. </p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--result""> <p>can</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Our approach and progress would not have been possible without the input and direct feedback from a wide range of stakeholders and supporters. I am deeply appreciative of our students, families, staff, community leaders, national experts, and the Barr Foundation—all of whom played vital roles in this ambitious and amazing redesign process. It takes a village to move this work forward. We continue to evolve and learn every day. What follows are some of the key lessons we’ve acquired about high school redesign through our work in Holyoke.  </p>
<h4>Consider current and future stakeholders.</h4>
<p>At every phase of the redesign process, it is critical to engage a broad cross-section of the population—alumni, community leaders, current K-12 parents and students, representatives of higher education institutions, business leaders, and booster clubs. In particular, we realized we need to do more to engage our late elementary and middle school parents and students who are the ones who will experience the transformation from start to finish. Each stakeholder group brings its own set of priorities, but finding common ground and creating a shared vision is essential to moving forward. In Holyoke, regular meetings and updates were conducted with local state representatives, the school committee, our regional employment board, presidents of higher education institutions, and the community at large.  We also engaged school and district staff in monthly professional development sessions.  </p>
<h4>Be aware of deeply held views and recognize they will take time to evolve.</h4>
<p>High schools tend to be sacred within communities, and many people feel a strong bond to these institutions. In addition, adults in the community might feel nostalgic about their own high school experiences and believe they were well-served by the existing schools, which may lead them to question the necessity of making significant modifications to the way they operate. Therefore, it is important to convey clear and consistent messages about the need for change. For example, often the community needs recalibration around the notion that career and higher education are not mutually exclusive. Our business and higher education leaders shared how they regularly encounter students (many of whom graduate high school with honors) who do not have the knowledge and skills necessary to thrive in today’s workplace. We leveraged the employment board and local employers to explain that to be successful in today’s workforce, one must possess strong professional, writing, communication, mathematical, and critical thinking skills. Further, it needs to be underscored that there is inherent rigor in learning paths that authentically and aggressively prepare young people for life after high school. At the same time, school systems should be careful to maintain long-standing traditions and rituals that are part of the fabric of the community.  </p>
<h4>Seeing is believing.</h4>
<p>Visiting a variety of high school models was critical in shifting from an improvement process to an innovation process for developing the new vision of high school education. More than 50 Holyoke stakeholders (students, parents, community members, teachers, counselors, school leaders) completed more than 150 site visits to traditional public, charter, vocational, alternative, religious, and private high schools in New England and across the country. Our stakeholders were engaged as authentic learners and visionaries in the early stages. One design team member commented, “We can improve what we know, but it is extremely hard to do something different if we do not know what it looks like in action.” Another individual commented, “I’ve grown up as a student, teacher, and leader in Holyoke.  This was my first visit to a school beyond our city in more than 35 years.” Visiting schools provided a point of comparison, interrupted the status quo, and helped establish a vision for what might be possible.   </p>
<h4>Student voice and participation matter.</h4>
<p>Four sophomore students (two from each high school, intentionally representing a variety of student sub-group populations) were key leaders in our exploration process. We deliberately created space for student voice within meetings, often letting students have the final word. On school visits, the students were the first among their teams to see the differences and opportunities within the cultural and instructional models. While other team members may have hesitated, the students served as the strongest advocates for something new and different for Holyoke schools. </p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--and""> <p>voice</p> </blockquote>     </p>
<h4>Protect the learning… there are many shiny bullets!</h4>
<p>It is tempting to visit one school, be drawn to a particular program, and feel as though you have the “answer” to high school redesign. We encouraged our team members to attend at least two school visits in order to view multiple approaches and strategies in action. What initially might have seemed like “the answer” did not always persist to become part of the strategic plan; rather, it often guided further inquiry. Taking time to debrief, reflect, refocus, and extend the inquiry and learning was important in generating a bigger shared vision for change. The first solution might be the best, but others always need to be explored to confirm or challenge initial assumptions. Your true “answer” to high school redesign needs to be customized for your school and community, so learning from different models is key.    </p>
<h4>Identify internal early adopters to lead the change.</h4>
<p>Change is hard. In “Leading Change: Why Transformational Efforts Fail,” Kotter talks about the importance of building a coalition. This coalition has a “shared commitment and enough power to lead the change effort.” A dynamic superintendent or trusted principal isn’t sufficient to successfully implement a high school redesign process. Yes, of course, your leaders must be on board and be vocal champions. Yet, the true change comes at the classroom level from those educators closest to our students—who will learn and change their practice to meet the changing needs of our students. Who are your early adopters within the school who will be your vocal advocates for change and lead the change process? In Holyoke, we identified strong teacher leaders who had the respect of their peers, were veteran educators, had strong ties to the city, and who also saw the need for change.  </p>

<p>As a result of our deep high school visioning process to date, we developed a <a href=""https://www.hps.holyoke.ma.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/High-School-Redesign-Strategic-Plan.pdf"">strategic plan</a> that calls for a set of theme-based academies that will provide numerous pathways for students to ignite motivation, interest, engagement, and learning. While I am proud of what we have accomplished to date, I also acknowledge that we have a great deal of work left to do. As we continue to plan and implement, our strategic plan continues to evolve. Our high school teachers and leaders, with partners, are now engaged in a planning process to define each academy and the structures and systems that will enable them to flourish.</p>

<p>High schools across the country need to rethink and reimagine the experience for students, so that our young people are energized about their own learning and prepared for whatever the futures holds for them. For those folks embarking on secondary redesign efforts, I applaud you.  There is so much exploration and learning that can be done. Identify the “quick(er) wins” that you can implement early and well to build momentum. Begin planning early for more transformational and complicated efforts. Give yourselves permission to make mistakes and learn from them. But don’t take too long. Our students cannot wait for the “perfect” answer.  Start soon, learn and adapt along the way, and continue to get better. You can do it. Best wishes to you, and please share your journey with us as well!</p>

333,The Imperative for Aspiration,<p>Five questions for a world-class city to create a great public realm.</p>,"<p>As I write this, Boston is currently one of over 200 cities that has submitted a bid for Amazon’s “HQ2” (along with 25 other bids from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts alone).  Amazon’s bid process—not dissimilar to that for the 2024 Olympic Games several years ago—has generated an urgency to articulate a compelling and bold vision. In doing so, Boston’s bid also aims to address some of our region’s longstanding challenges, such as those related to transportation or our vulnerability to climate change.   </p>

<p>Regardless of whether Boston is ultimately the winning city, I hope we are able to sustain the power of aspiration that infuses the exciting and forward-looking vision that Boston’s bid represents.   </p>

<p>Aspiration makes for great cities, and this was a theme that I addressed recently when I was invited to speak at the Members’ Meeting for the Friends of the Public Garden. I entitled my remarks “The Imperative for Aspiration” as I reflected on some of the assets we have in our public realm.  </p>

<p>In Boston, the Boston Common, the Public Garden, the Emerald Necklace, and the Charles River Esplanade, to name a few, are enduring treasures that animate this power of aspiration.  But we cannot rest on our laurels, and I suggested five key questions that we must address in order to ensure continued aspiration with our public realm:   </p>

<ol>
<li>What does public engagement with our public realm look like today?<br></li>
<li>How can we nurture and encourage an embrace of a culture of experimentation and risk-taking in shaping our public realm?<br></li>
<li>What are the ways that we can best activate public space?<br></li>
<li>What is the impact of climate change on our parks?<br></li>
<li>Where do we go from here?<br></li>
</ol>

<p>Barr’s interest in this subject flows directly from our <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/stewarding-bostons-waterfront"">Waterfront Initiative</a>, an effort focused on stewarding one of Boston’s treasures—our waterfront—for future generations by ensuring access for all, addressing climate resiliency, and creating great open spaces and parks.  </p>

<p>Indeed, our collective ability to advocate for and invest in a great public realm is what will continue to draw great companies and talented people to a place like Boston. We remain committed at the Barr Foundation to serving as a constructive partner with those who share the importance of embracing such a long-term view.  </p>

<p>If you are interested in learning more about my reflections on this subject, I invite you to read my full remarks to the Friends of the Public Garden below. </p>

332,Barr Announces RFP for Cohort Two of the Engage New England Initiative ,<p>Foundation issues request for proposals for a second cohort of teams to design schools focused on connecting students off track to graduate to success in high school and beyond.</p>,"<p>In 2016, Barr announced a new multi-year initiative, <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/education/engage-new-england"">Engage New England: Doing High School Differently,</a> which is part of the Education Program’s regional strategy focused on the development and expansion of new secondary school models in New England. Through the Engage New England initiative, our goal is to marshal critical resources, awareness, solutions, and opportunities to support one of New England’s most marginalized high school populations: students who are off track to graduate from high school—and therefore have extremely limited opportunities to connect to post-secondary success.</p>

<p>Today, we are excited to announce a <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/partners/rfp"">request for proposals</a> (RFP) to identify the second cohort of teams that will join this initiative. The Barr Foundation seeks proposals from teams interested in developing quality, innovative public high schools and programs across New England designed to shepherd students toward a path to graduation and post-secondary success through a model rooted in <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/what-is-positive-youth-development-in-high-schools"">positive youth development theory</a> that engages students through their interests and empowers students with the integrated knowledge and skills that connect all with college, career, and community. Selected teams will embark upon a deep planning and design year to develop a new or redesigned school model that deliberatively and comprehensively supports students who are not on track to graduate. </p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--excited""> <p>are</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Our goal is to support the development of exemplary schools and programs across the region that can powerfully demonstrate the impact of intentionally addressing both academic and developmental needs with student-centered, targeted, and supportive approaches. We believe that all students can meet high expectations when they have a choice to learn in a school that meets their interests, empowers their potential in a caring and creative environment, and fully prepares them for success in life. </p>

<p>The teams selected through this RFP will join the first cohort of the Engage New England initiative, which was <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/barr-announces-first-cohort-of-partners-in-30-million-engage-new-england-doing-high-school-differently-initiative"">announced in June</a>.  A third cohort will be selected in the summer of 2019. Engage New England participants connect within and across cohorts, and are partners in an innovation collaborative—learning from each other and like-minded innovators across the nation, while receiving robust technical assistance from design and planning through implementation. Together they will build a diverse set of school models that transform high school learning experiences for young people whose prior experiences have failed to engage them and empower their success.    </p>

<p>This RFP addresses the first phase of potential funding for Cohort 2 teams, which is for planning.  Starting today, applicants can begin preparing their proposals for one-year planning grants of up to $150,000 each to support the development of their school or program. A webinar for prospective applicants will be held <a href=""https://confirmsubscription.com/h/t/8DA328B808F52CD5"">this November</a>, and additional opportunities to learn about the initiative and ask questions will be available during <a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdFralTIDLW-TGs3njMEDRz3G4U9VZfVVCZSo75LR1ritORpQ/viewform"">“office hours”</a> via conference calls on November 29 and December 15, 2017 and on January 12, 2018. Barr will accept proposals via an online form until January 22, 2018. </p>

<p>We expect to announce the new cohort of as many as eight planning teams in July 2018. In addition to financial support, each year awardees will receive technical assistance and will have access to collective learning opportunities facilitated by our nonprofit partner <a href=""https://www.springpointschools.org/"">Springpoint</a>. Springpoint is a national nonprofit organization that supports the design and launch of innovative public high schools. </p>

<p>Planning grant awardees that are successful in their planning and design efforts will be invited to apply for two-year implementation grants of up to $750,000 each. We anticipate that successful applicants in the implementation phase will then launch their expanded, improved, or new models in the fall of 2019. </p>

<p>We believe that all students have the right, and the ability, to connect to secondary and post-secondary success. In order to fully realize their potential, all students—even those who are not currently on track to graduate—can and must be supported to achieve at high levels. Doing so requires targeted investments in new models that embrace a student-centered approach. We are excited to be able to offer this funding opportunity and look forward to partnering with a second cohort of leaders in this work. </p>

331,Six Questions with Barr's New Education Senior Program Officer,<p>Getting to know Kate Dobin who leads Barr’s Boston K-12 strategy for Education.</p>,"<h3>1. How did you start working in education?</h3>
<p>After college, I started working in investment consulting and decided to volunteer in a Boston elementary school. This experience inspired me to learn more about education systems and their impact on what I was doing and seeing in the classroom. A few years later, during graduate school, I became an Education Pioneers (EP) Fellow, a 3-month experience designed to be an &quot;education in education.”  The program had two components: A full-time internship with NewSchools Venture Fund (NSVF), working with NSVF to understand where their support was most valuable to grantees, where it wasn’t, and develop strategic recommendations for the future; and weekly workshops with the other EP Fellows, who came from a variety of fields and with a range of internship placements. We researched and discussed the achievement gap, the history of education policies, and debated the current education reform efforts underway in Boston and across the nation.</p>

<p>After my EP experience, I wanted to find a way that I could contribute to the efforts of public education by using my skills and background. I joined Parthenon’s K-12 Education strategy consulting team and spent the next six years helping school districts, non-profits, foundations, and state departments of education develop strategies to improve K-12 education.</p>
<h3>2. What was one particularly inspiring, memorable project you worked on?</h3>
<p>I had the opportunity to work with a large urban school district to review their human capital strategy.  Human capital is incredibly important to the fabric of a school system, and because the strategic elements can vary widely, there were many stakeholders involved in the process, both internally and externally to the district. To have so many different stakeholders align on a common vision was challenging, but the result was a comprehensive and cohesive approach, and it showed me what can happen in education when everyone comes to together around a shared goal.</p>
<h3>3. After working with schools and districts across the country, what attracted you to Barr and to K-12 education in Boston?</h3>
<p>Being a K-12 strategy consultant for six years was a great experience. I got to work with many different communities to understand the challenges that schools and systems face. As I thought about my next role, I knew I had many valuable experiences that I could bring with me, but that there are also a lot of experiences I hadn’t had. I wanted to continue to learn from those who work in education in a variety of roles and settings. Barr’s approach to philanthropy and its set of values, especially its sense of humility and modesty, really resonated with me. Barr recognizes philanthropy as a privilege, really respects its partners, and believes that the solutions reside in those we serve. I think that philanthropy done right can catalyze positive change, and I believe Barr is committed to the right set of values to be that catalyst. The other thing that attracted me to this role in particular at Barr was the opportunity to work more deeply, and over a more extended period in Boston. I share Barr’s commitment to expanding access to high-quality education in Boston, and its belief that all students can achieve success. I am so humbled by this opportunity, and am looking forward to working with those in and around Boston to help make this a reality. </p>
<h3>4. How have you spent your first two months here at Barr?</h3>
<p>I’ve focused on working with our grantees, and on listening and learning. Barr has a long history of funding K-12 education in Boston. So, I arrived to a number of pre-existing, and in some cases, longstanding, grant relationships. I’m learning from them and the great work they’ve done for the students of Boston, and I’m looking for ways to support their efforts. That will certainly continue to be a priority for me.  I have also been on a listening tour around the city to deepen my understanding of the landscape—meeting with folks to better understand their experiences, what efforts are already underway, and what the needs and opportunities are. </p>
<h3>5. In your experience, what elements are essential for creating quality educational experiences for all students?</h3>
<p>I don’t think there is just one model that makes for a quality educational experience, but there are common elements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Meet students where they are by addressing their needs and supporting their abilities.</li>
<li>Provide engaging learning experiences so that students can think about skills and content beyond the walls of the classroom.</li>
<li>Encourage a culture of high expectations and believe in students’ ability to achieve.</li>
<li>Empower high-quality educators and school leaders who uphold these values in their work every day.<br></li>
</ul>
<h3>6. Who was your favorite teacher?</h3>
<p>My favorite teacher was and continues to be my fifth-grade math teacher, Ms. Frasier. I do not remember ever opening a textbook, but I’m sure we did. Obviously, there was a curriculum, but what I remember vividly is how her teaching was geared toward real-world learning. I remember one project where we got on ladders, measured the height and width of the walls, and calculated how much paint we would need to give the entire gymnasium a fresh coat. My teacher created routines that made math relevant—like daily word problems featuring a down-on-his-luck “Farmer Fred,” and his disastrous crops. We helped poor Fred figure out whether to plant a new crop, drop the price on his current crops, invest in a new fancy irrigation system, or a whole host of other decisions. We didn’t realize that through these word problems we were learning arithmetic, economics, and business. Don’t get me wrong, it was not all fun and games, she set very high expectations for us, but she made learning hands-on and engaging.  </p>"
330,Sound Lessons from Seattle,<p>Eight lessons from Massachusetts leaders on a study tour of mobility innovations in Seattle.</p>,"<p>Massachusetts is abuzz with talk about whether Amazon might choose one of our communities for its second North American headquarters. Just days after Amazon announced a nation-wide search for “HQ2,” we visited the company’s longtime home, Seattle, with a delegation of more than a dozen Massachusetts leaders.</p>

<p>This study tour – funded by the Barr Foundation to see how another region is approaching transportation – was an eye-opener for our group of civic, government, mobility, environmental and housing leaders.</p>

<p>What we learned in two full days of meetings with planners, transportation agency leaders, real estate developers, experts, and advocates in the Puget Sound region can be applied to our transportation and housing challenges in Massachusetts, whether or not Amazon’s HQ2 ends up in the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>Seattle is encouraging smart, sustainable, efficient and equitable transportation choices. We should be aggressively doing the same in Massachusetts because it’s the right thing to do for the businesses – and people – who are already here. </p>

<p>The takeaways are compelling, starting with the economic backdrop. The Sound region is booming: 9.5 percent population increase in the last six years and over 2 percent job growth in the last year alone. Fueled by growth – with a mix of startups and other large employers, such as Microsoft and Boeing – Seattle has embraced the challenge of moving millions of people every day, while focusing on improving the everyday experience of commuters, today and for decades in the future. </p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--embraced""> <p>has</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>We saw some important similarities, and key differences in how Washington state and Massachusetts approach mobility challenges. Both states are economically driven by a major metropolitan area. Both have thriving coastal regions, with a history of water transport to complement roadways, public transit, biking and walking. Both states combine an embrace of technology with a tradition of industry, and have a culturally aware, diverse population from all over the country and the world.</p>

<p>We also witnessed severe traffic congestion problems across the Seattle region – sound familiar? Persistent gridlock in Seattle has motivated elected officials and residents to plan and pursue a bold new vision of their collective future.</p>

<p>Viewed through the lens of housing, transportation, politics, and governance, there are some takeaways for Massachusetts in how we can better prepare for a strong future:</p>

<p><strong>Plan for growth.</strong> The Seattle area has enormous demand for housing, and, like Boston, struggles to ensure affordability. We learned that the State of Washington’s  Growth Management Act (in law since 1990) compels a forward-looking plan at every level of government, so that the region’s housing, transportation, land use and service delivery have a framework for success.</p>

<p><strong>Destigmatize transportation choices.</strong> Every type of person uses every mode of travel. And most use two or more in a typical day. People who choose bus, rail, cycling, and walking represent a true cross-section of the public, because the options are generally reliable and clean. In transportation-speak, the Seattle region has many “choice riders” – for example, professional workers who commute by bus because it’s convenient, comfortable and efficient.</p>

<p><strong>Promote safety.</strong> Vision Zero – striving for no traffic fatalities – is taken to heart. During a walking tour of Downtown, we saw how the Seattle Department of Transportation is adding miles of protected bike lanes, dedicated bike traffic signals, and is aggressively implementing the lessons of a comprehensive bike/pedestrian safety analysis, recognizing the urgency of safety upgrades when so many people compete for limited pavement.</p>

<p><strong>Give voters a say.</strong> This past November, metro Seattle voters in the Puget Sound region approved a transformative $54 billion expansion for Sound Transit that will significantly build out a light rail system and express bus service to accommodate tomorrow’s needs. That’s not unique; many states offer voters the opportunity to direct tax dollars to local and regional transportation projects, so that the public is accountable for approving long-term investments.
Invest for tomorrow. No taxation system is perfect, but Washington is making its work for the future. Although there’s no state income tax, the state gas tax is more than 49 cents per gallon, (double that of Massachusetts) and the sales tax tops 10 percent in some areas. And Sound Transit has its own taxation authority. Together, the region is investing in mobility, whether through transit expansion, protected bike lanes, freight, and even their own Big Dig, the SR-99 tunnel.</p>

<p><strong>Manage congestion.</strong> Seattle traffic can be horrendous. No region can pave its way out of gridlock, so Seattle is experimenting with variable pricing that changes with time of day or in reaction to real-time levels of congestion, while building out the public transit system to move the region’s workforce with sustainable and affordable transportation options.</p>

<p><strong>Put equity on the front burner.</strong> The Puget Sound region is being transformed in a way that threatens to displace many residents because of housing costs and redevelopment. Maintaining affordable housing and transportation is critical, so the Growth Management Act provides protection, along with diligence by public officials dedicated to equity and advocates for equity and affordability, while an innovative low-income fare program (ORCA LIFT) aims to keep transportation affordable to those who need it the most.</p>

<p><strong>Work together.</strong> Different units of government collaborate on services and solutions – city, county, regional and state. And businesses leaders, advocates and regional leaders are at the table. There will always be turf issues and political drama, but we witnessed a strong theme of collaboration to deliver results.</p>

<p><strong>Experiment and innovate.</strong> Seattle embraces pilot programs as a way to learn and get results. A great example is its brand-new “dockless” bike-share program. After their station-based system collapsed, the city received unsolicited proposals dockless bike sharing. These were tweaked and approved, and in only six months, Seattle has the second highest number of shared bikes of any city in the United States, with three vendors competing on price, features and service. It’s also revenue positive for the city.</p>

<p>Massachusetts has many strong assets, including the bones of a strong public transit network, great public institutions, a thriving knowledge economy, a dynamic, well-educated workforce, and regions with great quality of life. On some levels, we have what Washington State is striving hard to achieve.</p>

<p>Yet the delegation’s experience in Seattle had many of us wanting to return home and champion the kind of collaborative, forward-looking policies necessary to ensure that we can all thrive in the years to come, earning and maintaining the confidence of the public, which in turn is empowered to make decisions.</p>

<p>Massachusetts doesn’t need Amazon HQ2 to be a great Commonwealth, although undeniably their investment here would be welcome. But we’d be wise to learn from Seattle’s success (and challenges!) as we look to seize a brighter, more prosperous, and more equitable future.</p>

329,The Results Are In: All-Door Boarding a Boost for the MBTA’s Silver Line Bus,"<p>For two weeks, Silver Line riders boarded the bus through three doors instead of one. Here’s how it changed the commuting experience.</p>","<p>If you have been following the trajectory of Barr’s Mobility program, you know that our goal is to modernize the state’s transportation system – and that we’ve been looking closely at the potential of bus rapid transit (BRT) to help meet that goal. Through the BostonBRT initiative, we’ve assembled technical teams to analyze the viability for the <a href=""http://www.bostonbrt.org/the-brt-report/"">best corridors</a>, brought decisionmakers and advocates to <a href=""https://vimeo.com/182737425"">ride BRT systems</a> that carry more people per day than all MBTA services combined, invited architects and designers to think about what <a href=""http://www.bostonbrt.org/station-design-contest-1/"">future BRT stations</a> could look like, and more. As a next step, and with the BostonBRT Advisory Committee’s guidance, we realized that we could do more…we could help the Boston region experience BRT.</p>

<p>To start, BostonBRT partnered with MassDOT and the MBTA to enhance the Silver Line. For two weeks in Spring 2017, on the Silver Line routes 4 and 5 that run from Dudley Square to Downtown, BostonBRT and MassDOT tested one of the five basic BRT elements – <a href=""http://usa.streetsblog.org/2017/01/04/all-door-boarding-can-save-time-for-bus-riders-if-transit-agencies-embrace-it/"">all-door boarding</a> – to see if riders felt an impact on their Silver Line trips. Under regular conditions, all riders board through the bus front door only, which takes time at each stop, adding up over the entirety of a route. The all-door boarding demonstration allowed people to get on the bus using all three bus doors. So, did all-door boarding have an impact? And if yes, how much? Here&#39;s a look at the commuting experience with all-door boarding:</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full""> <div class=""u-fluid-iframe""> <div class=""u-fluid-iframe-inner""> <iframe src=""//player.vimeo.com/video/238062606?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0"" title=""Featured Video"" frameborder=""0"" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen loading=""lazy""> <a href=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/238062606?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0"">A video on Vimeo</a> </iframe> </div> </div> </div></p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--all-door""> <p>did</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Data from the MBTA and survey results from 900 riders during the demonstration showed us that:</p>

<p><strong>All-door boarding dramatically improved the slowest bus trips.</strong> The worst trips – the ones you don’t forget – were considerably faster during the demo. The buses spent 30% less time at bus stops, saving up to a minute and a half of time over course of a bus trip. Although that’s only 90 seconds per trip – it makes a difference when added up commute after commute for riders, plus it offers the opportunity to get the buses back into service more quickly.</p>

<p><strong>All-door boarding allowed for more buses to leave on time, and fewer delays at the busiest stops.</strong> With so many riders getting on the bus at the first and last stops on the Silver Line 4/5, one of every five buses starts a route late. By allowing riders to board the bus using all doors, more buses started their route on-time. This made the bus arrival times more predictable and accurate along the route, reducing rider wait time and providing a more reliable service.</p>

<p><strong>All-door boarding had the biggest impact at the stops where a lot of people are getting on the bus.</strong> At the busy stops, boarding was 50% faster when using three doors instead of one. For the busiest stops along the route, this made a big difference, taking an average 42 seconds to board over 30 people and get the bus moving to the next stop—60% faster than during normal conditions! See the time savings documented in the video below. </p>

<p><div class=""Media -full""> <div class=""u-fluid-iframe""> <div class=""u-fluid-iframe-inner""> <iframe src=""//player.vimeo.com/video/229560324?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0"" title=""Featured Video"" frameborder=""0"" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen loading=""lazy""> <a href=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/229560324?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0"">A video on Vimeo</a> </iframe> </div> </div> </div></p>

<p><strong>Two of every three riders felt their trip was faster during the demo.</strong> All-door boarding is intended to make the boarding process faster, resulting in shorter travel times and an overall better experience. Given the unenforced dedicated lane, delays at traffic signals, and other factors, bus travel times during these two weeks did not vary significantly from typical days. Yet, a surprising finding was that 65% of riders reported that their trips felt faster. The survey responses indicated that riders value getting on and off the bus quickly, so all-door boarding resulted in a better experience for riders.</p>

<p>We were pleased with these findings, because we knew that the Silver Line, with its partial dedicated lanes and transit signal priority, is already a high performing route (you can expect an average local bus to show up on-time about 60% of the time, whereas the Silver Line routes are at about 80%). This demonstration confirmed our hypothesis: layering one new element of basic bus rapid transit to an existing route makes an overall slight positive impact. What would the rider experience look like if we continued the dedicated lane, improved the transit signal priority, and added platform-level boarding?</p>

<p>We hope to continue to answer this question and others as BostonBRT continues to partner with the MBTA, municipalities in Massachusetts, community and advocacy organizations, and others to test and experience the impacts BRT could have on our daily commutes. </p>

327,"Our Creative Sector is Big, Booming, and at Risk","<p>This article was originally published in the Viewpoint section of the Boston Business Journal on September 27, 2017.</p>","<p>People want arts and creativity in their lives. They also want jobs and economic growth in their communities. But too few of us realize how these two concepts are vitally linked. That needs to change.</p>

<p>According to two recent reports — <a href=""https://www.nefa.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/Jobs%20in%20New%20Englands%20Creative%20Economy%20and%20Why%20They%20Matter%20web.pdf"">“Jobs in the Creative Economy in New England and Why They Matter,”</a> by New England Foundation for the Arts, and <a href=""http://www.americansforthearts.org/sites/default/files/aep5/PDF_Files/ARTS_AEPsummary_loRes.pdf"">“Arts &amp; Economic Prosperity 5”</a> by Americans For The Arts— the creative economy is a much bigger part of our economy than many realize. By “creative economy,” we mean both nonprofit arts-and-culture organizations as well as creative professions such as graphic design, architecture, photography and film, among others, where workers may be employed in for-profit firms or as freelancers.</p>
<h4>Consider a few key findings:</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>In New England, there are nearly 310,000 people employed by the creative economy — that’s roughly the size of the construction sector workforce.
Workers in New England’s creative economy earn a total of nearly $17 billion every year. </p></li>
<li><p>The nonprofit arts industry in Massachusetts (just one piece of the larger creative economy) supported 73,288 jobs and generated $1.4 billion in resident household income. </p></li>
<li><p>In Massachusetts, the nonprofit arts industry also generated more than $2.2 billion of economic activity in 2015 — $1.3 billion in spending by arts and cultural organizations and an additional $879.5 million in event-related expenditures by their audiences (e.g., dinner, drinks, travel, parking). </p></li>
<li><p>In fact, more often than not, the arts are the primary draw to a community: the Americans for the Arts report found that 69 percent of non-local audience members state the reason for their visit was “specifically to attend this arts or cultural event.&quot; </p></li>
</ul>

<p>For too long, many have considered arts and creativity as “nice-to-haves,” rather than viewing them for what they truly are: vital components of a healthy economy. More than anywhere else in the nation, in Massachusetts and New England our creative economy is fundamental to our broader economy. It is big, and it is booming. Yet, it is also under threat. And we can’t take for granted that it will continue to grow and thrive.</p>

<p>The sector is being disrupted by technology and consumer preferences; the cost of living in the region is high compared with the rest of the nation. We need to nurture, support and invest in the potential of our creative economy in the same way we do other important business sectors.</p>

<p>These investments promote other sectors as well. Technology, higher education, medicine and many other fields employ and depend on creative workers.</p>

<p>This fall, as dozens of candidates for state and municipal offices share their visions for a thriving Massachusetts, ask where they stand on this critical driver of our economy. And feel free to share these important findings with them. Business leaders can also develop and deepen partnerships with their local arts and cultural institutions, to bolster their capacity to enrich the lives of employees, draw new visitors and revenues, and enhance vitality in their communities.</p>

326,New Grants Support 11 Schools to Redesign Where Learning Happens,"<p>Connecting more students to success by blurring the lines between school, college, career, and community.</p>","<p>In order to prepare all students for post-secondary success, students must have access to learning opportunities that help to build the knowledge and skills necessary for successful transitions to college and career. To support high schools in their efforts to leverage the assets within their surrounding communities in order to provide students with a comprehensive program of study, the Education Program <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/learning-beyond-the-walls-of-traditional-high-schools"">announced in March 2017</a> the “Preparing for Post-Secondary Success Through the Wider Learning Ecosystem” request for proposals (RFP). The goal of the RFP was to identify existing, public New England high schools that are committed to engaging in a deep planning and capacity building phase to redesign their school model to transcend the school walls and blend the lines between school, college, career, and the community in order to help all students develop the competencies required for a 21st-century definition of student success.</p>

<p>Today, it is our pleasure to announce the eight planning and design phase grantees, representing 11 high schools. All of the grantees are committed to redesigning their high school model to meet the identified needs of their students and communities. They also have a vision for a public high school model that utilizes evidence-based strategies and practices to provide students with credit-bearing learning opportunities in the wider learning ecosystem that includes the myriad educational, business, and non-profit organizations within the surrounding communities. Rather than peripheral programs, these learning experiences in the ecosystem will be central components of the schools’ programs of study.</p>

<p>Grants range in size from $225,000 to $860,000 for up to two years of planning and design work. The funds will be used to develop actionable implementation plans that transform existing public high schools into models that leverage the wider learning ecosystem to offer all students one or more of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Anytime-anywhere learning opportunities</strong> that enable students to participate in experiential learning and build social capital in the community; and augment the school’s capacity to provide comprehensive, holistic programs of study.</li>
<li><strong>Career development</strong> experiences that promote students’ awareness of their interests and options, and deepen student engagement in school through connecting the relevance of their coursework to their future plans.</li>
<li><strong>Early college experiences</strong> that expose students to the environment of post-secondary education and enable students to earn college credits while completing the requirements for their high school diploma.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rather than peripheral programs, these learning experiences in the ecosystem will be central components of the schools’ programs of study.</p>

<p>The eight grantees were selected from a total of 31 applicants that responded to the request for proposals, representing a variety of local education agencies and non-profit organizations. Based on the quality of the implementation plans, some grantees may be invited to submit a proposal for an implementation grant.</p>

<p>New England has done a good job for many students, but we believe we can do a great job for all. Innovative high school models that are responsive to students’ interests and needs, as well as the expectations of the world beyond the school walls, can help all students navigate a path to post-secondary success. These models can address readiness gaps and promote successful post-secondary transitions by utilizing an expanded definition of what it means to be college and career ready, and through a school design that offers a wide range of learning opportunities that align with that definition.</p>

325,The Power and Potential of our Creative Economy ,"<p>Business, government, and cultural leaders champion findings of new reports detailing how much “Arts Means Business” in New England.</p>","<p><em>On September 25, Jim Canales joined Massachusetts State Senate President Stan Rosenberg, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Jim Rooney, and other leaders to celebrate the release of new economic impact data from <a href=""https://www.nefa.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/Jobs%20in%20New%20Englands%20Creative%20Economy%20and%20Why%20They%20Matter%20web.pdf"">New England Foundation for the Arts (NEFA)</a> and <a href=""http://www.americansforthearts.org/sites/default/files/aep5/PDF_Files/ARTS_AEPsummary_loRes.pdf"">Americans for the Arts (AFTA)</a> on the power of the region’s creative economy. Below are Jim’s remarks from the press conference.</em> </p>

<p>Good morning everyone, I’m Jim Canales, president of the Barr Foundation.</p>

<p>At the Barr Foundation, we believe arts and creativity are essential for vibrant, vital, and engaged communities. And what we are also coming to discover through research and analysis is that arts and creativity serve as major economic drivers.</p>

<p>In an effort to understand just how much that is the case, Barr supported two new studies by both NEFA and AFTA to better understand this important sector, its contributions, and its needs.</p>

<p>The results of these studies--really for the first time--provide a clear picture of the value of the creative economy in this region. That’s what we want to highlight today.</p>

<p>Here in New England, our arts and culture sectors create jobs, boost tourism, and generate government revenue. </p>

<p>There are nearly 310,000 people employed by the creative economy in New England, with nearly half employed in cultural institutions providing close to 150,000 creative economy jobs in MA - and the rest doing creative work as part of private companies or as independent contractors. </p>

<p>What do we mean by the creative economy? It is not just comprised of those who create art or those who work at arts institutions, although they are an important part of this story. Today, the creative economy includes many people working at desks right here at Sonos and around the corner at an ad agency. It includes people who are self-employed and those who are entrepreneurs, web designers, jewelers, music teachers and many others. </p>

<p>Because of this research, we now know that collectively people working in the creative economy in New England earn nearly $17 billion a year.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--know""> <p>now</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>We also know that this group is a larger part of New England’s economy than we find in other regions of the country. In New England, those who are a part of the creative economy comprise nearly as many as those who work in either government or construction in the region.</p>

<p>Because arts and culture are such an important part of the regional economy --interwoven into the fabric of a vibrant place to live -- we need to nurture, support and promote this sector in the same way we would any other part of the business sector.</p>

<p>We know that all sectors employ - and need - creative workers, from technology to higher education to medicine. </p>

<p>And there are challenges facing this creative economy: the sector is being disrupted by technology and consumer preferences and the cost of living in the region is high compared with the rest of the nation.</p>

<p>That’s why today is so important. We see Arts Means Business as an opportunity to bring together leadership of all sectors—public, private and nonprofit—to commit to nurturing this creative economy. Each of us has an important role to play in that regard.</p>

323,"Commuting to Boston by Boat? In Five Years, You Could Be.","<p>Insights into new efforts to expand ferry service in Boston Harbor, from Alice Brown of Boston Harbor Now.</p>","<p>Fully leveraging Boston’s Harbor could mean less congestion on our roadways and more options for public transit. That is why Barr is excited to partner with Boston Harbor Now and several other stakeholders to study the potential of expanded water transportation in Greater Boston. Three months into the effort, I caught up with project manager Alice Brown to learn more:</p>
<h4>What prompted this study, and what are its goals?</h4>
<p>Right now, there are three MBTA routes and three other commuter ferry routes operating in the Boston Harbor. But, a lot of people don’t know these ferry routes exist or that water is a great way to get around the Boston region. At the same time, there many people excited about expanding water transportation now that there is ongoing development on the waterfront. So, what we hope to accomplish with the Water Transportation Study is to not only build on existing service with new routes, but to build awareness of existing service. We hope the study results in increased ridership for existing routes and detailed business plans for adding one to three new ferry routes over the next five years.</p>
<h4>Before coming to Boston Harbor Now, you helped the City of Boston facilitate Go Boston 2030, a vision and action plan for Boston’s transportation future. Water transportation was a piece of that. So, why do we need another plan?</h4>
<p>Different plans operate at different scales. Go Boston 2030 was an incredible project to work on: it was multi-modal, it addressed mobility concerns from every single neighborhood in Boston, and it proposed solutions at a local, cross-town, and regional level. But, proposing a new ferry route is not the same thing as mapping out the implementation of that route. Through this process, we are really looking at where there is enough demand from current and potential riders, and where community, business, civic, and political leaders are most ready to work together on bringing new routes to implementation.</p>
<h4>Hearing from everyday people was a <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/a-transportation-plan-that-began-with-a-question"">core tenet of the Go Boston 2030</a> process. How is this a piece of the Water Transportation Study? </h4>
<p>Very often in community engagement processes, there are loud voices that you hear from again and again. But, we also want to hear from people who might not normally spend their time thinking about water transportation. So, we’re reaching out in many ways to hear from the broader community. That community includes existing ferry riders, potential ferry riders, and people who have taken a ferry before (such as to the Harbor Islands), but have not thought of it as a commuting option. To reach this constituency, we’re riding ferries and talking with people during their commutes, we’re emailing them, tweeting about the study, and posting flyers in parks, on docks, and in key harbor locations. We want to connect with people in a way that’s convenient for them. </p>
<h4>So far, what’s the biggest difference between transportation planning on the water compared to land?</h4>
<p>The tradeoffs are not as easy to visualize for water transportation. People understand there is very limited space on our streets and more space for one mode of transportation most likely means less space for other modes. But, when people look out at the ocean they assume it is a blank slate and there is space for an unlimited number of vehicles. In reality, water has its own set of infrastructure challenges. To even get on the water, you need to have a high-quality dock, ramp facilities that are ADA accessible, Coast Guard compliance, and vehicles that can withstand the various weather conditions that we have in Boston Harbor. Tough choices have to be made when planning for water, but the tradeoffs are not as clear cut as lanes on a road. 
 </p>
<h4>What advice would you offer others who are leading a planning process?</h4>
<p>Right away, get clear about the question that you’re trying to answer. I spent eight years as a teacher before I became an urban planner and I practice what teachers call “backwards planning.” I think about the end goal and then work backwards to identify the steps I need to take and the input I need to get to that end point. So, for this planning process, the first big step is gathering enough input to answer the question: “<em>What would make someone a pick a ferry?</em>”</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--big""> <p>first</p> </blockquote></p>
<h4>You seem to have really taken to your new role as evidenced by your Twitter handle, <a href=""https://twitter.com/ferryfaerie"">@ferryfaerie</a>. What is it about ferries that gets you so excited? </h4>
<p>I don’t think it’s any surprise for someone who has taken a boat that it’s the most popular transit service from a passenger satisfaction perspective. It’s incredible to be out on the harbor where there is so much beauty and history surrounding you. I appreciate the experience even more knowing that just 30 years ago, the water would have offered a much different experience, being not nearly as enjoyable or beautiful as it is today. </p>
<h4>What was your favorite ferry experience this summer?</h4>
<p>One of my favorite side projects this summer has been organizing a series of boat-bike trips so that people can experience both the boats as well some of the amazing places they will take you. There are great parks and paths and accompanying adventures accessible from each of the existing ferry routes in Greater Boston.</p>
<h4>Can people still share their ideas? And, if so, how?</h4>
<p>The survey is open until Friday, September 22 and can be found at <a href=""http://bostonharborsurvey.com/"">bostonharborsurvey.com</a>. I encourage everyone to visit that site, enter the code “<strong>BHN</strong>,” and take five minutes to tell us how they make travel choices and what draws them to the harbor. There is also additional <a href=""http://www.bostonharbornow.org/what-we-do/work/water-transportation/water-transportation-study/"">background information</a> about the water transportation study on Boston Harbor Now’s website.</p>

<h4>After the survey closes, what’s next?</h4>
<p>I’m really excited to look at the survey data to understand where people are in support of an expanded ferry service.  In Go Boston 2030, we used a lot of really large data sets but we weren’t asking the kinds of questions that allowed us to build statistical models about how people in the region make transportation choices. I’m excited to see how we can leverage this survey data to inform ferry service.</p>

322,Northeast States Extend Leadership on Clean Energy,"<p>Ambitious new goals set for next phase of highly successful, market-based effort to reduce emissions and spur clean energy.</p>","<p>Since 2009, nine Northeastern states have been running an enormously successful program that is boosting state revenues, reducing how much consumers pay for energy, and accelerating our transition to a clean energy economy. Now, that program—the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI)—is on track to get even stronger. On August 23, the RGGI states announced the good news that they would extend and strengthen RGGI, reducing power plant emissions by another 30 percent from 2020 to 2030. The proposed 2030 goal represents a 65 percent drop from emission levels when RGGI was formed in 2009, which is tremendous progress for the electric sector in our region.</p>

<p>This announcement is an inspiring example of bipartisan collaboration to address climate change (five governors in RGGI states are Republicans, four are Democrats), and signals to the world that forward-thinking leaders in the U.S. are committed to reducing carbon emissions. Collectively the RGGI states are the sixth-largest economy in the world with $2.8 trillion in GDP. California, where the legislature recently voted to extend its own cap-and-trade program through 2030, is close behind at $2.5 trillion.</p>

<p>Reaching this agreement was the result of a great deal of hard work by many people and organizations, including staff and officials in state administrations, environmental and grassroots advocacy organizations, business leaders and researchers. Barr is incredibly privileged to have joined a diverse group of funders including the Merck Family Fund, the Energy Foundation, The Devonshire Foundation, Daniel Hildreth, The Betterment Fund, Alexander Beck, Jr., and Thomas Haas at the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation that supported independent analysis to inform the program review. We are also proud to have partnered with numerous organizations who provided input and mobilized diverse stakeholders to weigh in on various aspects of RGGI’s program design.</p>

<p>RGGI is living proof that investments in driving down emissions can yield significant benefits beyond addressing climate change—including economic benefits, consumer savings, and public health improvements.</p>

<p>Some of the key RGGI benefits data include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Consumer benefits: In a <a href=""https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/08/23/emissions/Bu8VXv5jqkqldVNKXpafON/story.html"">report released last year</a>, the Acadia Center found RGGI states reduced emissions by 16 percent more than other states while the region’s economy had grown 3.6 percent more than the rest of the country. At the same time, energy prices had fallen by an average of 3.4 percent while electricity rates in other states rose by 7.2 percent.    </p></li>
<li><p>Economic benefits: Independent <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/new-study-finds-massachusetts-climate-policy-yields-economic-gains-for-stat"">reports by the Analysis Group</a> show that RGGI is generating billions of dollars in economic benefit and producing significant clean energy jobs across the region. The states’ use of RGGI auction proceeds has boosted the purchase of goods and services in the regional economy, for everything from solar installations, to engineering services for energy audits, to labor for efficiency retrofits. Energy efficiency and clean energy investments also improve the cost-effectiveness and reliability of the grid by reducing peak demand, which in turn lowers wholesale power prices and helps avoid the need for costly infrastructure investments.   </p></li>
<li><p>Health benefits: According to an <a href=""http://abtassociates.com/AbtAssociates/files/7e/7e38e795-aba2-4756-ab72-ba7ae7f53f16.pdf"">Abt Associates study</a> released earlier this year, RGGI has reduced air pollution from fossil fuel power plants, generating public health benefits which have saved hundreds of lives, prevented thousands of asthma attacks, and saved $5.7 billion in health-related economic costs. Improved health and productivity benefits also extended to the neighboring states of Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia, as well as the District of Columbia.     </p></li>
</ul>

<p>What happens next? In late September, there will be a conference in Maryland for stakeholders to seek public input on the proposed program changes. The states then move to implementation over the next couple of years so that the new emissions reduction targets can be in place by 2020.  </p>

<p>Earlier this summer, as a backdrop to deliberations among the RGGI states about the project’s next phase, news broke of the Trump Administration’s decision to leave the Paris Climate Agreement. Leaders from business, institutions, and state and local governments responded quickly and forcefully. Through the <a href=""http://wearestillin.com/"">“We Are Still In”</a> initiative, they pledged to meet or exceed the goals of the Paris accord. With these new RGGI commitments, the Northeast states amplify the same message: the U.S. will not abdicate leadership on climate, even if some in Washington are determined to squander the opportunity.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--amplify""> <p>states</p> </blockquote> </p>

<p>The Northeast states have stepped up to show the world that climate leadership will continue in the U.S., despite a lack of federal action. The collaborative, data-driven approach taken by leaders across the region is a model that proves once again that we can drive down carbon pollution and grow the economy, while building healthier communities for years to come.</p>

321,Meet Barr’s New Arts & Creativity Program Officer,<p>Six Questions with SueEllen Kroll.</p>,"<p><strong>1. As Arts &amp; Creativity program officer, what will you focus on?</strong>     </p>

<p>Currently, I’m working closely with San San on a little bit of everything to understand the landscape of our expanded Massachusetts region. I’m a Massachusetts native, so I have some understanding of the ecosystem—especially outside of Boston. Over time, I’ll be focusing more on the Foundation’s capacity-building efforts (like our partnership with the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/arts-creativity/barr-klarman-arts-capacity-building"">Klarman Family Foundation</a>) and our creative placemaking investments.</p>

<p><strong>2. What is creative placemaking?</strong>       </p>

<p>Creative placemaking is the convergence of arts with community and economic development. It is a term to describe a range of community-based arts methods and creative tools communities use to activate and improve their neighborhoods. This means everything from enhancing entrepreneurship opportunities, developing public space, and focusing on public health. Arts and culture are an important way to engage communities in conversations. Creative placemaking allows people from different backgrounds and sectors to work together for better communities. Giles Li, executive director of Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center and a 2017 Barr Fellow, <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/against-the-tides-of-change-arts-and-culture-as-placekeeping-force"">wrote a blog for us</a> recently on how this has been an important strategy for their work.</p>

<p><strong>3. Before Barr, you were the director of grants and strategic partnerships at the Rhode Island Council for the Humanities. What is one lesson in effective grantmaking you’re bringing with you?</strong>   </p>

<p>One is the importance of balancing ambition with what is feasible. I’m attracted to bold ideas. Yet, I came to appreciate the importance of working with organizations to come to an honest understanding of their capacity. I love seeing the excitement and willingness to take risks. You also need to know that organizational change takes time and careful planning to enable those exciting ideas.</p>

<p><strong>4. Describe a favorite project from your time in Rhode Island.</strong></p>

<p>One of my favorite projects was <a href=""http://catalyzingnewport.org/"">Catalyzing Newport</a>. This was a new model we developed for catalyzing culture at the local level. It involved hosting national thought leaders, or “catalysts,” in Newport for week-long residencies deeply tied to community issues. We focused on ways to empower the local community to have a voice in decision-making. We hosted a dozen catalyst residencies in three years that experimented with many exciting new program ideas. As an example of one project, we brought public high school students and Yale graduate students together to create a seven-foot model of their ideal community center. We unveiled the model at a community dinner where residents discussed their hopes and dreams for the neighborhood. The people we worked with were creative and thoughtful in their problem-solving. We wanted to bring all voices to the table on issues of development and other challenges facing Newport.</p>

<p><strong>5. Do you consider yourself a creative person? What are your creative pursuits?</strong>     </p>

<p>I’m careful not to call myself an artist, but I do consider myself creative. I have produced and worked on podcasts, <a href=""http://actionspeaksradio.org/"">radio shows</a>, and when I find time, I dabble in some travel writing and photography projects. My podcasts are generally story-based. In one series, I interviewed people about their breakup stories. In another, I collected stories about people’s <a href=""https://beta.prx.org/stories/38541"">worst job experiences</a>. It was right after the recession, Rhode Island had the nation&#39;s second-worst economy, and I wanted people to hear these stories and feel less isolated.</p>

<p><strong>6. What’s one recent artist, exhibit, or creative experience that left an impression and why?</strong>  </p>

<p>I recently went to MassMoCA and saw an exhibit by a Maine photographer, Tanja Hollander, “Are you really my friend?” The artist took a portrait of each of her 626 Facebook friends, and I spent hours looking at the portraits. You couldn’t escape the current events of our time in her work. I wasn’t expecting that international thread. There were interesting questions posed about friendship in the digital age. It was a great exhibit that shows how arts and culture deliver on in-person experiences in an increasingly impersonal world.</p>"
319,We Must All Speak Out,"<p>Together, we must ensure that hate does not prevail.</p>","<p>At a moment in our country’s history when the President of the United States chooses to fuel division with his words and through his actions or inaction, it is no longer an option to remain silent.</p>

<p>We at the Barr Foundation add our unequivocal voice to the growing chorus that explicitly renounces the violent expressions of hate and the vile racism and bigotry that we witnessed in Charlottesville in August. Of course, such sentiments are not isolated to Virginia, and with a President who increasingly empowers these fringe actors, we will see more of it.</p>

<p>That we find ourselves in this moment only reinforces the fact that our work is far from complete on our way to fulfilling this country’s promise of “e pluribus unum.” It is a moment that should lead all of us to decide what we should do, how we can engage, and where we can commit energy and resources to demonstrate unambiguously that there are not “many sides” to moral imperatives such as fighting racism and combating bigotry in all of its forms.</p>

<p>In Barr’s philanthropy, we focus on creating a better future. We do this by investing in expanding opportunities for young people, helping them to develop the skills and competencies to be critical thinkers and engaged citizens. We aim to address one of the most urgent challenges of our time in climate change, an area under particular attack by this administration, which only strengthens our resolve to ensure we are protecting our planet for future generations. And we seek to ensure that artistic expression in all of its forms remains vibrant and relevant. This is especially needed at a time when the arts can serve as a powerful tool to express our humanity, capture the essence of this moment, and engage us in constructive dialogue. All of these commitments will continue unabated, of course, as we believe that these investments in potential will lead to a better tomorrow.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, and following some of the early actions of the new presidential administration and expressions by the President that the media were “the enemy of the American people,” Barr announced a <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/civil-liberties-informed-democracy"">special initiative</a> focused on investigative journalism and support for frontline organizations working with the most vulnerable communities in Massachusetts, including immigrants and refugees, LGBTQ people, and people of color. To date, we have committed over $3 million to this critical work, which we saw as a necessary expansion of our grantmaking in view of today’s reality.</p>

<p>We will remain focused on opportunities to engage with this perilous moment in our country’s history. Whether through our grantmaking, other ways we can best support our partners, or the use of our own voice, we will remain vigilant about how we can play a role, along with many others, to ensure that hate does not prevail.</p>

<p>Earlier this week in Boston, <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/martins-park-inspiring-joy-promoting-peace-on-boston-waterfront"">we celebrated the groundbreaking</a> for Martin’s Park, honoring Martin Richard who was tragically killed in the 2013 marathon bombing. That joyous and energetic event embodied the best of our city, with its clear focus on inclusion, its emphatic messages of unity and peace, and its evident spirit of hope and aspiration. It was a day that called us to be our best, to honor a young boy who immortalized the message: “No more hurting people. Peace.” And it was a day that reminded us that good can come out of evil when we are resolute in a shared commitment to forge a better tomorrow.</p>

<p>It is that spirit that will continue to animate our work at Barr, as we stand resolute in our continued commitment to the principles of inclusion, equity, and opportunity that inform all that we do.</p>"
318,Inspiring Joy and Promoting Peace on Boston’s Waterfront,<p>The Martin Richard Charitable Foundation and partners celebrate the groundbreaking of Martin’s Park.</p>,"<p><em>On August 16, Jim Canales joined the Richard family, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, Dana Smith of the Smith Family Foundation, Carole Charnow of the Boston Children’s Museum, and many other partners of the Martin Richard Charitable Foundation, to celebrate the groundbreaking of Martin’s Park. Barr has committed $3 million to support the park’s creation and maintenance as part of the Foundation’s Special Initiative promoting a great public realm along Boston’s waterfront. Below are Jim’s remarks from the ceremony.</em></p>

<p>Good afternoon. It is my pleasure to represent the Barr Foundation today, which has committed $3 million in support of Martin’s Park.</p>

<p>The Barr Foundation was motivated to participate in this compelling civic project for many reasons, but perhaps this anecdote says it best:</p>

<p>During one of the very first conversations I had with Bill and Denise Richard, they noted poignantly that they sought to honor their son Martin in a way that looked forward with hope rather than looked back with sadness. Their intent was to turn a tragic event in their lives into an opportunity that paid tribute to Martin’s spirit and brought benefit to many others.</p>

<p>Martin’s Park promises to be a place of joy, a site for community, a space for fellowship, and a venue of beauty. As such, this park will embody Martin’s spirit abundantly.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--promises""> <p>Park</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>The park will also encourage us to realize our highest aspirations.</p>

<p>First, it will be a place accessible to young people of all abilities, for them to enjoy all that the park will offer. This focus on accessibility was a core commitment from the early planning for what this park should be and the bar it would set for others.</p>

<p>Second, the park will be built in a way that is fully cognizant of its location on the waterfront and the reality of a changing climate. Fort Point Channel already floods on a somewhat regular basis, so the park has been designed to be resilient to flooding, storm surge, and the related effects of climate change.</p>

<p>And finally, Martin’s Park will showcase the very best of urban park design.</p>

<p>We are delighted that the City selected the noted landscape architecture firm, Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, for this project.</p>

<p>Michael has been personally engaged throughout, bringing his tremendous vision and creativity to this project in a way that honors Martin and responds to the Richard family’s vision. </p>

<p>For all of these reasons, the Barr Foundation was honored to contribute to a project that we know will become a destination for our home city. We designated $2 million of our commitment to create a maintenance endowment to ensure that Martin’s Park receives the quality of care it deserves in perpetuity. We have been pleased that many others have also contributed to this endowment, so future generations of Bostonians can delight in the park’s wonder.</p>

<p>Today’s headlines and the events of this past weekend in Charlotteville affirm that we live in challenging times. Occasions such as today’s remind us that when there is division and discord in our society, messages of hope resonate and unite.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--as""> <p>such</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>In that way, Martin’s immortal message perhaps carries even more resonance today. That message of peace, etched in our memories, will now live on through the physical transformation of this space.</p>

<p>Martin’s Park will serve as an inspiration to all. What a privilege for all of us to be here at the beginning, and what a wonderful legacy the Richard family has created for Martin and for Boston.</p>

<p>Denise and Bill, thank you for allowing all of us to take part in translating your vision into reality.</p>

317,Unlikely Meetings. Uncommon Solutions for the Future of Mobility.,<p>Sharing the big ideas and ongoing conversations from the Meeting of the Minds Boston Mobility Summit.</p>,"<p><em>Living in the “Hub of the Universe,” it’s easy to forget that cool stuff can happen in other places. Conferences have been particularly useful to me in my work: they are a great way for diverse people to come together, share ideas, and form partnerships. One of my favorites, which I participate in each year, is the Meeting of the Minds Annual Summit.</em> </p>

<p><em>When I connected with Meeting of the Minds a few years ago, I quickly realized that its conferences are set apart from others by two distinct elements: 1) they bring together leaders from all sectors to focus on urban sustainability and technology challenges; and 2) they schedule ample time to brainstorm with thought leaders in the room. Together, these two elements support the unusual and interesting partnerships that make things happen.</em></p>

<p><em>This is why Barr invited Meeting of the Minds to host a <a href=""http://meetingoftheminds.org/events/boston#agenda"">Mobility Summit in Boston</a> this past June. What ideas could 130 leaders from the private, public, nonprofit, and academic arenas come up with for a more resilient and equitable mobility future in Boston? (We gave only them a day!)</em></p>

<p><em>Meeting of the Minds Executive Director Jessie Feller Hahn shares with us some of the key findings that emerged during the daylong summit this June, held at the Microsoft NERD Center.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>While Greater Boston continues to prosper, the region sits at a unique moment in the history of mobility and growth. With the roadways and MBTA over capacity and the region’s population continuing to grow, the region will need strong collaboration across sectors to thrive. With that in mind, the Boston Mobility Summit convened leaders from diverse backgrounds currently working on the kinds of innovations the region will need.</p>

<p>The result was a fascinating exchange of ideas—a convergence of researchers, NGO leaders, funders, city planners, and more, collectively developing a range of solutions Greater Boston might pursue. Here are some overarching themes:</p>
<h3>Accessibility as the Goal of Transportation</h3>
<p>Massachusetts Secretary of Transportation Stephanie Pollack challenged the traditional approach to transportation in Greater Boston in her <a href=""http://meetingoftheminds.org/session/state-state-key-challenges-opportunities"">morning plenary</a>. She urged the audience to reframe transportation as a matter of accessibility: how do people get where they need to go? Do people have access to what they need to live prosperous lives—jobs, housing, healthcare, family, parks, schools, childcare, and other essential services? Reframing transportation work to focus on how to support people to gain access to opportunity has the potential to lead us in a powerful new direction. Participants brainstormed ideas ranging from an overhaul of current governance structures to using untraditional data sources to better understand where people want to go.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--to""> transportation <a class=""Pullquote-cta"" href=""https://twitter.com/intent/tweet/?dnt=true&amp;text=work""> <svg width=""48"" height=""48"" viewBox=""628 -718 2048 2048"" class=""Icon"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg""> <path d=""M2417.2-86.6c1.2,17,1.2,33.9,1.2,50.9c0,517.3-393.8,1113.4-1113.4,1113.4c-221.7,0-427.7-64.2-601-175.7 c31.5,3.6,61.8,4.8,94.5,4.8c183,0,351.4-61.8,485.8-167.2c-172-3.6-316.2-116.3-365.9-271.4c24.2,3.6,48.5,6.1,73.9,6.1 c35.1,0,70.3-4.8,103-13.3C916.1,424.7,781.6,267.2,781.6,76.9c0-1.2,0-3.6,0-4.8c52.1,29.1,112.7,47.2,176.9,49.7 C853.1,51.5,784-68.4,784-204.2c0-72.7,19.4-139.3,53.3-197.5C1030-164.2,1319.6-9.1,1644.3,7.9c-6.1-29.1-9.7-59.4-9.7-89.7 c0-215.7,174.5-391.3,391.3-391.3c112.7,0,214.4,47.2,285.9,123.6c88.4-17,173.3-49.7,248.4-94.5c-29.1,90.9-90.9,167.2-172,215.7 c78.7-8.5,155.1-30.3,225.3-60.6C2560.2-211.4,2493.6-142.4,2417.2-86.6z""/> </svg> Tweet This </a> </blockquote></p>
<h3>The Expected Convergence of Uber, Autonomous Vehicles, and Transit</h3>
<p>It won’t come as a surprise that emerging technologies were the subject of much of the summit’s discussion, particularly when it comes to how they will interact with transit and the streetscape, for good or ill. Discussions focused on ideas for how to reframe public transit to make it competitive with new rideshare technologies, as well as ideas on how to address the increasing and competing demands for limited curb space, a precious public resource in Boston. A broader theme emerged during multiple work sessions around the levers that decision-makers have to ensure that new mobility technology complements transit rather than dismantles it. Participants brainstormed financial and non-financial incentives, policies, and pilot programs that have the potential to improve access to all neighborhoods, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and fill transit gaps.</p>
<h3>Planning for Climate Change</h3>
<p>A third primary theme at the summit was preparing Greater Boston for climate impacts such as extreme temperatures, powerful storms, and frequent flooding. Participants discussed some potentially simple but effective changes, like making heat-prone streets shadier with tree canopies and awnings, and longer-term land use and transportation goals, such as making it easier for people to live, work, shop, and play locally, without the need for a car. Participants also tackled weightier solutions such as a new “resiliency infrastructure fund” to pay for long-term projects like resilient waterfront design or a Harbor wall, with a particular focus on protecting Boston’s most vulnerable neighborhoods from climate impacts.</p>

<p>The discussions begun locally will expand beyond the confines of the Boston Mobility Summit at the Meeting of the Minds Annual Summit, where the Boston region will have a cohort of leaders reporting back on their discussions and proposed initiatives. We invite you to <a href=""https://www.regonline.com/registration/Checkin.aspx?EventID=1951262"">join us</a> at the Annual Summit in Cleveland on October 25–27, and we are accepting scholarship applications from leaders in the public sector, nonprofit sector, and academia (you can <a href=""http://meetingoftheminds.org/scholarship"">apply here</a>).

316,The Arts Mean Business,<p>New report shows the economic impact of the nonprofit arts and culture industry across the country and in six Massachusetts communities.</p>,"<p><em>In June, Americans for the Arts released the findings from its latest study, Arts &amp; Economic Prosperity 5 (AEP5). AEP5 takes a comprehensive look at the economic impact of the nonprofit arts and culture industry. Barr provided support for Massachusetts to participate in the study, as well as for a detailed analysis of six cities: Boston, Cambridge, Lowell, Medfield, Springfield, and Worcester.</em></p>

<p><em>We invited Robert Lynch, president and CEO of Americans for the Arts, to share his thoughts on AEP5, highlight some of the key findings, and explain what it means for the arts and culture industry in communities across the nation.</em></p>

<p>At Americans for the Arts, we believe the arts are an investment that delivers both community well-being and economic vitality. While many businesses and government leaders believe in the value the arts brings to their communities, they are also honest about the challenges faced when trying to balance arts funding with the demands to support jobs and grow their economies. That is why I’m proud to share our latest study, <a href=""http://www.americansforthearts.org/by-program/reports-and-data/research-studies-publications/arts-economic-prosperity-5""><em>Arts &amp; Economic Prosperity 5</em> (AEP5)</a>, American’s for the Arts’ fifth economic impact study of the nation’s nonprofit arts and cultural organizations and their audiences, and the most comprehensive study of its kind ever conducted.</p>

<p>By every measure, the results of AEP5 are impressive. Nationally the nonprofit arts industry generated $166.3 billion of economic activity in 2015—$63.8 billion in spending by arts and cultural organizations and an additional $102.5 billion in event-related expenditures by their audiences. This activity supported 4.6 million jobs and generated $27.5 billion in revenue to local, state, and federal governments (a yield well beyond their collective $5 billion in arts allocations).</p>

And in Boston alone, a whopping nearly 46,000 full-time equivalent jobs are supported by the nonprofit arts.</p>

<p>When we published our first economic impact study in 1994, it engaged just 33 local communities. The study has grown since then—AEP5 provides economic impact findings on 341 study regions representing all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Data were gathered from 14,439 organizations and 212,691 arts event attendees.</p>

<p>We have witnessed a corresponding growth in the understanding of the economic value of the arts. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, for example, now publishes an annual Arts &amp; Cultural Production Satellite Account, which extends beyond the nonprofit sector to include the full breadth of commercial and for-profit arts, education, and individual artists, and lists the sector as a $730-billion industry (4.2% of the nation’s GDP—a larger share of the economy than transportation, tourism, agriculture, and construction). Many state and local governments have established agencies to track and grow their creative economies.</p>

<p>AEP5 uses localized research that not only focuses on arts organizations, but also incorporates the event-related spending by their audiences. When patrons attend an arts event, they may pay for parking, eat dinner at a restaurant, enjoy dessert after the show, and return home to pay the babysitter. The study found that the typical attendee spends $31.47 per person, per event beyond the cost of admission.

<p>AEP5 also shows that one-third of attendees (34%) traveled from outside the county in which the arts event took place. Their event-related spending was more than twice that of their local counterparts ($47.57 vs. $23.44). What brought those visitors to town? Two-thirds (69%) indicated that the primary purpose for their visit was to attend that arts event. The message is clear: a vibrant arts community not only keeps residents and their discretionary spending close to home, it also attracts visitors who spend money and help local businesses thrive.</p>

<p>AEP5 demonstrates that the arts provide both cultural and economic benefits. No longer do community leaders need to feel that a choice must be made between arts funding and economic development. <em>Arts &amp; Economic Prosperity 5</em> proves that they can choose both. Nationally as well as locally, the arts mean business.</p>

314,Barr Announces Request for Proposals as Part of Waterfront Initiative ,<p>Foundation issues RFP to support constituency-building for a great public realm along Boston’s waterfront.</p>,"<p>In May 2016, the Barr Foundation <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/stewarding-a-boston-treasure"">publicly launched an initiative</a> to support the realization of a great public realm throughout Boston’s waterfront. We did so out of a firm belief that today’s decisions about the best use for Boston’s waterfront will have lasting impact for future generations, and that a comprehensive vision with a long-term perspective is essential.</p>

<p>To support this priority, Barr has thus far committed $6 million to advance a vision for Boston’s waterfront that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Provides exceptional parks and accessible open spaces;</li>
<li>Engages and reflects the full range of Boston neighborhoods and their residents;</li>
<li>Welcomes people of all ages, backgrounds, and abilities;</li>
<li>Enables responsible development that is attentive to the public’s interest, design excellence, and mobility; and</li>
<li>Seamlessly addresses the critical need for resiliency and adaptation to climate change.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/stewarding-bostons-waterfront"">Grants awarded to date</a> have principally supported Harbor-wide planning and capacity-building efforts.</p>

<p>As Barr looks to the next phase of its waterfront initiative, building upon the work of our current partners and the recently-released <a href=""https://imagine.boston.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Ib2030%20BOOK_Spreads--Create%20a%20Waterfront%20for%20Future%20Generations.pdf"">waterfront vision by the City of Boston</a>, <strong>we seek to elevate community- and resident-level perspectives on waterfront issues and to build constituencies focused on realizing a great public realm throughout Boston’s waterfront</strong>. To that end, we are today issuing a request for proposals (RFP) to support community-based efforts that advance these goals and that embrace a long-term vision for the waterfront.</p>

<p>The RFP is <a href=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/158/attachments/Barr_Fdn_Waterfront_Engagement_RFP.pdf?1501597450"">available here</a> and includes further details on the priorities and activities Barr aims to support. We welcome proposals from a range of organizations. Barr is particularly interested in organizations that reflect the diverse backgrounds of Boston residents and that have track records of success in engaging and mobilizing a broad and inclusive range of local constituencies.</p>

<p>We expect to announce a set of grants awarded via this RFP later in 2017, as well as to share additional updates on Barr’s waterfront initiative throughout the fall.</p>

<p>For Barr, the waterfront initiative requires the investment of patient capital oriented toward a long-term view. Success for this work will also require sustained engagement by the public, advocating for the waterfront they seek for themselves and for generations to come. The intent of this next phase of Barr’s work is to enable such engagement in an organized and coordinated manner, so that resident voices can be heard as we continue collectively to shape the waterfront that Boston deserves.</p>

311,Area Leaders Join Effort to Link Boston Neighborhoods and Job Centers with Bus Rapid Transit  ,"<p>Barr Climate Program Co-Director Mary Skelton Roberts interviews State Representative Russell Holmes and A Better City CEO Rick Dimino, members of a newly-formed advisory committee for BostonBRT.</p>","<p>Does Gold Standard bus rapid transit (BRT)—a mode that has taken off in cities across the world—have the potential to meet Greater Boston&#39;s mobility needs? This was among the many questions raised during Boston’s recent city-wide transportation planning process (<a href=""http://goboston2030.org/en/""><em>Go Boston 2030</em></a>), and one that the <a href=""http://www.bostonbrt.org/"">BostonBRT</a> initiative, a research and community engagement effort supported by Barr, seeks to answer.</p>

<p>To advance the BostonBRT work into the next phase, which includes BRT pilot projects in Greater Boston, the initiative recently appointed an <a href=""http://www.bostonbrt.org/the-sponsors/"">advisory committee</a> made up of ten regional leaders in sustainability, transportation, and government. Among them are State Representative Russell Holmes (D-Mattapan) and Rick Dimino, president and CEO of <a href=""http://www.abettercity.org/"">A Better City</a>, who also served as co-chairs of <em>Go Boston 2030</em>. Over 4,000 residents participated in that process, which resulted in a <a href=""https://www.boston.gov/transportation/go-boston-2030#vision-and-action-plan"">Vision and Action Plan</a> for Boston mobility priorities—including seven proposed BRT projects. </p>

<p>I had the opportunity to speak with Russell and Rick about BRT and the <em>Go Boston 2030</em> Vision and Action Plan. The following is excerpted from our conversation.</p>
<h4>Mary: What do you hope to accomplish as a member of the BostonBRT Advisory Committee?</h4>
<p><strong>Rick:</strong> Having spent more than 20 years working to improve transportation in Boston, I firmly believe that a high-functioning transit system means a high-functioning local economy. Some projections show there will be upwards of 130,000 new jobs in Eastern Massachusetts by 2035. We need solutions to help people get to and from those jobs and that’s where BRT comes in. The committee can help play a critical role in making BRT a reality in the city of Boston.</p>

<p><strong>Russell:</strong> We need to improve the transit system in Boston, especially in the neighborhoods that I represent. Mattapan is among Boston neighborhoods with the biggest transit gaps. If we have a system that gets people where they need to go as quickly and seamlessly as possible, think of all the free time people would suddenly have. Our residents deserve better, and that’s why I have been championing BRT for many years.</p>
<h4>Mary: To that point, the <em>Go Boston 2030</em> Vision and Action Plan is focused on providing better and more equitable travel choices, including better connections to jobs. Do you think BRT will really help the city achieve that goal?</h4>
<p><strong>Russell:</strong> I think the Vision and Action Plan is a game-changer for everyone who lives or works in the city. For people living in Mattapan, the commute to good jobs in places like Longwood Medical Area takes well over an hour. The problem is lack of transit infrastructure. There’s just no easy way to commute to job centers without driving. BRT has the obvious potential to help the people in my district connect with more jobs around Boston. This isn’t me just saying something that sounds good. <em>Go Boston 2030</em> is a plan made by the people, for the people. They spoke up loud and clear about wanting transit connections to places with jobs that pay well and provide good benefits. BRT can answer that call in several key corridors. </p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--is""> “Boston” <span class=""u-nowrap"">2030</span> </blockquote></p>
<h4>Mary: The <em>Go Boston 2030</em> Vision and Action Plan highlights BRT service between the Longwood Medical Area and Mattapan as a high-priority project and also lists six more possible routes. What benefits are associated with the proposed BRT projects?</h4>
<p><strong>Russell:</strong> It comes down to three basic things that people want from transit: 1) predictability; 2) convenience; and 3) a good experience. We need service that reduces waiting times and the need for multiple transfers, while maximizing reliability and frequency. </p>

<p><strong>Rick:</strong> The beauty of BRT is that it can fill important transit gaps and complement the existing system. You can’t build a rail line to downtown from neighborhoods like Oak Square in Brighton, but you could add a bus line there. And if there is a high-functioning, exceptional BRT line, more people will use public transit.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--BRT""> “beauty” <span class=""u-nowrap"">of</span> </blockquote></p>
<h4>What areas of the city stand to benefit from the proposed BRT projects in the <em>Go Boston 2030</em> Vision and Action Plan?</h4>
<p><strong>Rick:</strong> Each one of them has some merit. BRT projects are designed to make travel in the city faster, smarter, and cleaner, whether they are connecting Oak Square in Brighton to Downtown or linking the South Boston Waterfront to North Station. One great example is the proposed dedicated Massachusetts Avenue BRT service between Dudley and Harvard Squares. Existing service on the Route 1 bus carries more than 20% of the people who travel between the South End and the Back Bay—yet buses account for less than 5% of vehicles on this corridor! Imagine if we could help all those people get to work on time. Right now, nobody knows exactly when a bus will arrive. BRT, with dedicated bus lanes and smart signals that adapt in real-time, will eliminate that problem by delivering a better, faster cross-town trip for people who work along this route.</p>
<h4>Mary: If BRT is so great, why haven’t we done it?</h4>
<p><strong>Russell:</strong> For starters, it’s a new concept here for many people. Since BRT doesn&#39;t exist in Boston, it&#39;s difficult for people to fully grasp the potential of BRT until they see or experience how it works in other cities. Creating that level of understanding will take time and community engagement. We’re also going to need political will and public demand. We know the best BRT systems are custom-designed to fit local communities. We’re starting to see that with <a href=""https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2017/02/when-street-parking-becomes-a-pop-up-bus-lane/517404"">projects like the one in Everett</a>, which implemented a bus dedicated lane, one element of BRT. Over time, we need to show that agencies with financial constraints like the MBTA and MassDOT not only can help meet the needs of their customers with BRT, they can do it for less money than a train or a new road.</p>
<h4>How can Massachusetts residents help advocate for BRT projects in more places?</h4>
<p><strong>Russell:</strong> Elected leaders need to hear from residents—particularly public transit users—that designing a better bus system should be a key priority and that communities should test it. BRT does come with some tradeoffs: namely, creating dedicated bus lanes often means taking away parking spaces currently used for private cars. But, we believe an efficient and reliable BRT system with the potential to reach every neighborhood is a far better opportunity than the status quo.</p>

<p><strong>Rick:</strong> Businesses need to step up as well. The model of commuting is changing, with more workers—particularly young professionals—not wanting the hassle or cost of driving to the office every day. The MBTA continues to face transportation financing challenges. BRT can be a lower-cost, high-quality solution. The BostonBRT initiative is an opportunity for business communities throughout the region to come together around BRT as a tool to recruit and retain talent.</p>

308,Barr Announces First Cohort of Partners in $30-Million “Engage New England: Doing High School Differently” Initiative,"<p>Nine organizations from Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Maine receive planning grants to advance greater success for all students.</p>","<p>With the goal of bringing greater success to all students, last September, Barr’s Education Program launched a <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/education/engage-new-england"">first major initiative</a> focused on investing in new school models intentionally designed for those who were off track to graduate. Today it is our privilege to introduce the first of three cohorts of grantees under this initiative—newly-named, <em>Engage New England: Doing High School Differently</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.bacademy.org""><strong>Boston Day and Evening Academy, Inc.</strong></a>, Boston, MA, for the refinement and expansion of the current school model.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.crec.org""><strong>Capital Region Education Council</strong></a>, Enfield, CT, for the design of Personalized Success Academy, a new school model within the Public Safety Academy.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.chelseaschools.com""><strong>Chelsea Public Schools</strong></a>, Chelsea, MA, for the development of a new school model, Chelsea Opportunity Academy.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.domuskids.org""><strong>Domus Kids, Inc.</strong></a>, Stamford, CT, for the redesign of the school model for Stamford Academy charter school, which enrolls students from the region.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.msad60.org""><strong>Maine School Administrative District #60</strong></a>, North Berwick, ME, for the refinement and expansion of Noble High School’s Multiple Pathways Program. </li>
<li><a href=""http://www.themapacademy.org""><strong>Map Education, Inc.</strong></a>, Plymouth, MA, for the refinement and planning for the launch of Map Academy, a new charter school that targets the region.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.phoenixcharteracademy.org""><strong>Phoenix Charter Academy Foundation, Inc.</strong></a>, Chelsea, MA, for the refinement of the school model for Phoenix Charter Academy Chelsea, which enrolls students from the region.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.revereps.mec.edu""><strong>Revere Public Schools</strong></a>, Revere, MA, for the redesign of the school model for SeaCoast High School.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.treestreetyouth.org""><strong>Tree Street Youth, Inc.</strong></a>, Lewiston, ME, for the design of a new school in Lewiston Public Schools.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each partner will receive planning grants of $150,000 over one year, in addition to technical assistance in school model development and collective learning opportunities facilitated by <a href=""http://www.springpointschools.org"">Springpoint</a>, our initiative partner. Over the next nine months, Springpoint will lead the nine organizations through assessments of their assets and needs and support them in articulating a vision and plan for the experiences they aspire to create for their students. Depending upon the quality of the resulting plans, participants may also be invited to apply for implementation grants of up to $750,000 over two years, to be awarded in 2018.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--grantees""> <p>nine</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>The number and diversity of applicants to the RFP last November exceeded our expectations, with 49 proposals for a new school development or high school redesign, including at least one from each of the six New England states. The nine grantees represent a variety of approaches to advancing greater success for all students. They include concepts for both new schools and school redesigns. Hailing from Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Maine, they also represent both urban and rural schools, as well as a combination of district and charter public schools.</p>

<p>New England has done a good job for many students, but we believe we can do a great job for all by intentionally designing schools that align with the evidence of what works for all students: learning that is deeply personalized; a clear focus on student engagement and agency; and strong linkages to post-secondary and career opportunities. <em>Engage New England: Doing High School Differently</em> adds to the progress of New England’s schools by rethinking high school education, aligning it with <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/what-is-positive-youth-development-in-high-schools"">positive youth development theory</a> and creating a variety of whole school models that are as rigorous as they are flexible in developing content knowledge, successful habits, creative know-how, and navigation abilities—the integrated knowledge and skills that students need to access their full potential, connect to opportunities in college, career, and community, and to be successful in our rapidly-changing world.</p>

<p><em>Engage New England: Doing High School Differently</em> aligns with Barr’s mission to focus on the knowledge and skills all students need for post-graduate success and to rethink secondary education to provide greater success for all. While this first initiative focuses on students who are most in need, we believe that what works for those who are struggling most with our current, inflexible system can inform, augment and enhance opportunities for all secondary students.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--believe""> <p>firmly</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>We firmly believe that all students can meet high expectations when they have access to schools that are responsive to their interests and empower their potential in caring, creative, and flexible environments. <em>Engage New England: Doing High School Differently</em> is a first effort of many to provide all New England students with more diverse education opportunities that connect them to greater success in high school and beyond.</p>

<p>This is the first of three cohorts and the second RFP will be released in fall 2017.

<p>“It is our privilege to recognize and support this exceptional group of leaders,” said Roger Nozaki, Barr Foundation vice president. “Since the Foundation inaugurated the Barr Fellowship in 2005, Barr Fellows have built a remarkable legacy of service and impact in Boston and beyond. We look forward to working with and investing in this newest class—and to seeing what emerges from their individual and collective leadership.”</p>

<p>Members of this sixth class of Barr Fellows will participate in a two-year program that includes a group learning journey, a three-month sabbatical, and facilitated retreats with their cohort. Fellows’ organizations will also receive grants of up to $100,000 from the Foundation to invest in leadership and organizational development and in exploratory projects. To learn more about our new Fellows and their work, please visit the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/fellows"">Barr Fellows webpage</a>.</p>

<p>Each new class of Fellows is nominated through a confidential process; there is no application. This year’s <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/fellows#selection-process"">selection process</a> began in January with confidential nominations invited from more than 200 individuals, including Foundation staff, alumni of the Barr Fellowship network, and others who have strong knowledge of the diverse leaders working in Greater Boston. After confirmation of nominees’ eligibility, those nominators were invited to review and provide input on eligible candidates. An eight-member selection committee, including three Foundation trustees and five civic leaders, then determined finalists.</p>

<p>In a <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/barr-renews-commitment-to-signature-leadership-program"">February blog post</a>, Roger Nozaki described Barr’s continuing commitment to the Fellowship program, as well as some notable changes for this new class, following an extensive review of the program model over the past year. These changes include a significant increase in the amount of grant support provided to each Fellow’s organization, enriched professional development offerings (in particular, a greater focus on systems change and cross-sector collaboration), and expanded eligibility criteria to include leaders from outside the nonprofit sector.</p>

<p>Please join us in congratulating this extraordinary group of leaders.</p>

306,New Report Proves the Creative Economy is Underpinning New England’s Growth,"<p>New England’s creative workers earn nearly $17 billion per year, but are still being affected by global trends in technology and changing consumer habits.</p>","<p><em>Earlier this month, our senior program officer, San San Wong, attended the <a href=""https://www.nefa.org"">New England Foundation for the Arts (NEFA)</a> Creative Communities Exchange event in New London, Connecticut. During a special session, NEFA presented the findings from its latest report:</em> The Jobs in New England’s Creative Economy and Why They Matter. <em>Funded by a grant from the Barr Foundation, the report takes a deep dive into how the arts are faring in New England and what this means for our economy and our communities.</em></p>

<p><em>We invited Cathy Edwards, NEFA executive director, to share her thoughts on the importance of this report, as well as some of its key findings.</em></p>

<p>At NEFA, one of our missions is to strengthen the region’s creative economy through research that informs public policy. That is why we partnered with the Economic and Public Policy Research group of the UMass Donahue Institute (with the support of a grant from the Barr Foundation) to answer a few important questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What are New England’s creative enterprises?</strong> </li>
<li><strong>Who are New England’s creative workers?</strong> </li>
<li><strong>How do they overlap?</strong> </li>
<li><strong>How do they vary by state and what role are they playing in the overall economy?</strong> </li>
</ul>

<p>The result? Our latest report—<em><a href=""https://www.nefa.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/Jobs%20in%20New%20Englands%20Creative%20Economy%20and%20Why%20They%20Matter%20web.pdf"">The Jobs in the Creative Economy and Why They Matter</a></em>.</p>

<p>By finding data on and accounting for creative sector employment, income, demographics, and socioeconomic attributes, this report aims to provide a full story of creative work and workers in New England. What we know is that the creative sector is not just creative enterprises like museums and magazines, or artists such as musicians, painters, and dancers. It includes many industry sectors and occupations that contribute to the economic vitality and cultural attractiveness of a place.</p>

<p>There are nearly 310,000 people employed by the creative economy of New England—working within an organization or freelancing—who combined earn nearly $17 billion a year. This group is a more prominent part of New England’s economy than the national average, and it comprises nearly as many as those who work in either government or construction in the region.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--nearly""> <p>are</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>But how are these enterprises and workers faring? Those in the creative core industries and occupations, such as theater and photography, are in a segment that is stable or increasing. But the rest are being impacted by global trends in technology and changing consumer habits.</p>

<p>For example, as purchasing moves online, creative enterprises face more competition and less connection to the buyer. Creative workers become even more entrepreneurial—often because they have no choice—which means they are living job to job, with fluctuating wages, and without much of a safety net.</p>

<p>The data about the sector also show a high level of education, but a lack of racial diversity and affordable places to live or work in urban areas.</p>

<p>These trends present a great opportunity for new ideas, policies, and business models. The ability of local artists and creative workers to interact with and offer their products within their communities is fragile and maintaining such markets requires purposeful action.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--shows""> <p>research</p> </blockquote></p>
<h4>Our key takeaways:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The creative economy—through creative enterprises and freelance work—employs more than 310,000 people in New England, which puts it in about the middle of all sectors supporting regional jobs.<br></li>
<li>The share of creative employment and establishments (compared to other employment and establishments) is higher in New England than nationally. We need to maintain New England’s reputation as a region where the arts are a unique asset, and culture and creativity attract people to live and visit.</li>
<li>The presence of creative enterprises in New England’s cities and towns tends to be concentrated in places with higher population and income levels. </li>

<ul>
<li>A quarter of all creative workers and a third of artists are self-employed, whereas only 10 percent of New England’s overall workforce is self-employed.<br></li>
<li>All sectors employ—and need—creative workers. People with creative occupations like writer and designer work everywhere, not just in the arts. </li>
<li>New England has an especially high concentration of artists compared to the U.S., with a 20-percent higher prevalence of artists in its employment base. </li>
<li>Overall, this report builds upon our prior studies (<em>The Creative Economy Initiative: The Role of the Arts and Culture in New England’s Economic Competitiveness</em> in 2000, and <em>The Creative Economy: A New Definition</em> in 2007), as well as the real-time online community <a href=""https://www.creativeground.org"">CreativeGround</a>, which we launched in 2014 to reflect the creative people and places at work in New England. </li>
</ul>

<p>The employment and workforce data this report provides will allow states and cities to craft investments, policies, and programs to reach the workers and objectives of concern. As this research is updated in the future, the results of these investments can be tracked.</p>

<p>For now, we hope you’ll agree that this research shows how important arts and culture is in our economy. They’re not just nice to have—they’re essential to our region’s competitive advantage.</p>

303,Positive Youth Development – What Does it Look Like in High Schools?,<p>A recap and recording of a recent webinar featuring successful high schools intentionally designed around positive youth development theory.</p>,"<p>Positive youth development is increasingly recognized as an essential component of effective high school design. Positive youth development theory tells us that young people thrive in a school environment where they have positive relationships with adults, opportunities to explore their interests and assets, and regularly participate in experiences that are both engaging and have high academic expectations.</p>

<p>To explore this topic, we recently hosted a webinar to provide stakeholders in our region with an understanding of positive youth development theory, and how it translates into practice in high schools. We invited <a href=""http://www.springpointschools.org/"">Springpoint</a>, a national nonprofit that partners with school districts and networks to design innovative schools, to share five elements of positive youth development that are central to a high-quality high school design:</p>

<p><div class=""Media -aside -left""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img alt=""Key Traits of Positive Youth Development"" class=""Media-image"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1662/crop_preview.jpg?1642120492"" /> </div> <div class=""Media-caption""> <p>Key</p> </div> </div></p>

<ol>
<li>Caring, trusting, and supportive relationships</li>
<li>High expectations</li>
<li>Engaging learning experiences</li>
<li>Opportunities to contribute</li>
<li>Consistency</li>
</ol>

<p>These five tenets must be implemented across a school environment—including across all academic content areas and classrooms – to provide an education experience that engages all students to reach their full potential in high school and beyond.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--development""> <p>youth</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>In addition, we heard on-the-ground perspectives from staff and students at two high schools actively engaging with positive youth development practices. At schools that are designed and implemented with student development in mind, youth development practices are not an intervention or after-school program, rather they are pervasive across all aspects of the school. For example, David Krulwich, principal at <a href=""http://www.amsbronx.org/"">The Urban Assembly School for Applied Math and Science</a>, described the importance of knowing all students well through supportive staff relationships across all academic classes, and also through structures such as frequent advisory meetings.</p>

<p>Further, when implemented well, these elements are interrelated and mutually reinforcing, operating as a whole. For example, student Madegan Lynch from <a href=""http://cbhs.portlandschools.org/"">Casco Bay High School</a> described Senior Expedition where students select their own in-depth research project. It was evident that through the opportunity to select a research project of interest to her (Howard Gardner’s multiple intelligences theory), she was able to deeply engage in the topic. Madegan shared the high expectations associated with Senior Expedition, such as the requirements of conducting an expert interview and providing a culminating public presentation on the topic.</p>

302,"Against the Tides of Change, Arts and Culture as “Placekeeping” Force","<p>New arts and cultural center preserves links to a community’s culturally rich past, and brings hope of an enduring place in its future.</p>","<p><strong><em>Please note, this blog was written when Giles was a Barr Fellow and the Executive Director of Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center. In winter 2020, Giles became Barr&#39;s Senior Program Officer for Arts &amp; Creativity.</em></strong></p>

<p>In the 1960s, Boston’s historic Chinatown saw homes demolished, its public library destroyed, and a prominent community building literally halved—all to make way for new highway entrance ramps to better link the city’s suburbs to its financial district. Fifty years later, different forces, including a construction boom and skyrocketing rents, further threaten the character of a treasured community, making it increasingly difficult for families who have called Chinatown home for generations to see their place in Boston’s future.</p>

<p>In 2014, the <a href=""http://bcnc.net"">Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center</a> (BCNC), a social services agency, came to us with a proposal for what we found to be a compelling response to this challenge—to draw on the power of arts and culture for “creative place-keeping.” Lifting up Asian American traditional cultural and contemporary expressions by master and emerging artists, they envisioned a new arts and cultural center in the heart of Chinatown. A visible stake in the ground, the center would mark and celebrate the community’s cultural heritage, as well as inspire future generations to imagine and craft rich new narratives.</p>

<p>*Three years later, with a seed gift from Barr, funding from many others, and a groundbreaking partnership with <a href=""http://www.bhcc.mass.edu"">Bunker Hill Community College</a>, on May 6, BCNC celebrated the grand opening of the Pao Arts Center.</p>

<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" data-lang=""en""><p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">The just-opened Pao Arts Center in Chinatown is part gallery, part classroom &amp; part meeting space. <a href=""https://t.co/QqV5avvWeJ"">https://t.co/QqV5avvWeJ</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/bosarts?src=hash"">#bosarts</a> <a href=""https://t.co/R1vXWxP5dm"">pic.twitter.com/R1vXWxP5dm</a></p>&mdash; ArtsBoston &amp; BosTix (@artsboston) <a href=""https://twitter.com/artsboston/status/864903596470620163"">May 17, 2017</a></blockquote>

<script async src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script>

<p>I am so proud to lead BCNC at this time, as we open a space that puts arts and culture at the center of the conversation about Chinatown&#39;s past, present and—most importantly—its future.</p>

<p>I’m also deeply humbled and honored to have so many great partners in our corner—first and foremost, Bunker Hill Community College—as well as the Asian Community Development Corporation, South Cove Community Health Center, Mayor Walsh’s Office of Arts &amp; Culture, among many other supporters.</p>

<p>Of course, we owe an enormous debt of gratitude to Eleanor and Frank Pao for their leadership gift. We are so pleased that this center will bear their name. I also want to acknowledge San San Wong and Jim Canales of the Barr Foundation for being that important first funder to believe in and invest in this vision, and to demonstrate to others what potential there was here.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--who""> <p>people</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>The Pao Arts Center accomplishes three goals that are fundamental to the success of Chinatown, its inhabitants, and Boston’s Asian American community:</p>

<ol>
<li>It gives a platform to the many accomplished artists and masters of cultural practice in this community;</li>
<li>It serves as a bridge between Chinatown and the rest of our great city, including our exceptional cultural sector; and</li>
<li>Through classes, presentations, and an artist residency, the Pao Arts Center will engage the Asian American community and all populations in the area in exciting new opportunities to share, learn, and experience what makes life in Boston so special.</li>
</ol>

<p><div class=""Media -aside -left""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img alt=""Historic photo of young boy on sidewalk in Boston Chinatown"" class=""Media-image"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1656/crop_preview.jpg?1642120485"" /> </div> <div class=""Media-caption""> <p>in</p> </div> </div></p>

<p>BCNC has been building a strong community in Chinatown since 1969. Just a few years before our founding, the people who lived on the very land where the Pao Arts Center now sits were displaced. Their homes were destroyed to make room for the entrance ramp to the expressway.</p>

<p>Those who lived there back then quickly realized that the residents of Chinatown didn’t have much influence over decision-making when it came to Chinatown—or anywhere else in the city. Throughout BCNC’s almost five decades, we have seen our fair share of challenges:</p>

<ul>
<li>The adult bookstores and X-rated movie theaters of the Combat Zone that made the streets unsafe for residents;<br></li>
<li>Gentrification that has led to increased rents and further displacement of low-income residents; and</li>
<li>The isolation of new immigrants, which can lead to mental health and family functioning challenges.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our history of obstacles is undeniable, but they don’t determine what Chinatown means to me, personally. This is the place where my grandparents socialized, where they received traditional and modern medical care, where my mother saw old friends and made new ones. Chinatown allowed our entire family to remain connected to a past and a language that wasn’t necessarily prioritized in our daily lives.</p>

<p>Chinatown is also the place where I first made friends on my own and held my first job. This was where I learned the difference between a neighborhood and a community. To me, Chinatown is a community that opened its arms to people and families like mine—families that often didn’t feel all that welcome in other parts of the city.</p>

<p>Yes, Chinatown has seen more than its fair share of struggles. But its story is still an optimistic one—it’s about hope. By opening the Pao Arts Center, we’re helping write this community’s next chapter. For many, we believe this will be a new beginning.</p>

301,Unwavering Resolve to Advance Solutions for Climate Change,"<p>Recent remarks from Barr’s president reaffirming the Foundation’s commitment to advance ambitious goals, in partnership with others continuing to lead.</p>","<p><em>Last week at Boston City Hall, Barr Foundation president Jim Canales, Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh, and CERES President Mindy Lubber joined voices with those from around the world who understand the historic importance of the Paris climate agreement and the imperative of continued U.S. engagement and leadership to meet the climate challenge. Canales underscored the Foundation’s unwavering commitment to advancing solutions for climate change and to standing in solidarity with local, state, and regional partners willing to show vision and leadership, even in the face of a decision that would cede that leadership to others.</em></p>

<p><em>The following are adapted from Canales’ remarks—the entirety of which can be viewed in the video embedded below, along with comments by Mayor Walsh, who emphasized Boston’s resolve to continue its progress and meet its “responsibilities to our children and our planet,” and Mindy Lubber, on why failure to honor the Paris agreements, however unfortunate, would not be able to halt progress.</em></p>

<h4>Jim Canales’ Remarks:</h4>
<p>Foundations have the benefit of being able to take the long-term view on critical issues and to always consider how the decisions we make today will impact generations to come. In light of that, I want to acknowledge how deeply disappointing it is to consider the decision by the current administration to walk away from the Paris Climate Accord. It represents an enormous setback, not only for those who care about the environment, and those who know how vulnerable places like Boston are to climate change, rising seas, and extreme weather, but also for our nation and our economy.</p>

<p>Walking away from this agreement is tantamount to ceding leadership to countries like China, which are aggressively investing in clean energy, and setting themselves up to reap the benefits from a booming sector. Already there are more solar jobs than fossil fuel jobs in this country. This is thanks, in part, to forward thinking policies that opened those floodgates and also to the realities of the market, as clean energy by the day becomes more affordable and accessible. It doesn’t take a long-term view to see these markets are changing. It’s a real-time view.</p>

<p>This decision also diminishes the trust and credibility our nation has earned and compromises our ability to negotiate on this and other important issues in the future. So, it is such a disappointment to see our president take this step backwards, rather than seize the opportunity to extend our nation’s leadership and double down on the future.</p>

<p>Since 2010, the Barr Foundation has committed $110 million to helping Boston, Massachusetts, and our region demonstrate that kind of leadership—setting and making progress towards ambitious climate goals. Today’s decision only underscores the urgency of continued, bold action.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--the""> <p>2010</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>We are proud to have partnered with Boston—and commend the Mayor and his team for their leadership—consistently ranked as the most energy-efficient city among 51 large cities by the American Council for Energy Efficiency Economy. And we remain committed to supporting continued progress, and to translating ambitious visions, like the goal of making Boston carbon-neutral by 2020, into concrete steps towards those ends.</p>

<p><em>The Barr Foundation applauds the swift response in the past few days by a bipartisan group of state governors, including many from the Northeast, who formed the U.S. Climate Alliance, in addition to the more than 1,000 governors, mayors, businesses, investors, and colleges, and universities who have so far signed the <a href=""http://wearestillin.com"">“We Are Still In”</a> open letter, pledging to meet (and in many cases surpass) the goals of the Paris agreement. And we continue to encourage our philanthropic peers, no matter their size, scope, or mission, to join this important work.</em></p>

300,"New Opportunity for Massachusetts Secondary Educators to Learn, Network, and Be Inspired",<p>Learning-focused school visits aim to generate interest and capacity in the Commonwealth to create excellent high school models.</p>,"<p>Barr is excited to announce a partnership with Next Generation Learning Challenges (NGLC) to support <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BpceoLSdzQCvNifrxtm1kDu-hU_BpVR50gc4NVqzAcU/edit"">Mass Learning Excursions</a>, a new project offering teams of Massachusetts educators focused on secondary school excellence the opportunity to observe personalized, innovative, next-generation learning in models that have broken the traditional high school mold.</p>

<p>Through learning-focused school visits during the 2017–2018 school year, Massachusetts educators will be exposed to schools that demonstrate integrated approaches to next-generation learning in San Diego, the Bay Area, Brooklyn, and Philadelphia. Through its prior experience organizing learning excursions, NGLC has found that participating educators report that the school visits and interactions with innovative thought-leaders prompted examinations of practice and consideration of possibilities. Watch the video below to hear from participants who visited schools in San Diego.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full""> <div class=""u-fluid-iframe""> <div class=""u-fluid-iframe-inner""> <iframe src=""//player.vimeo.com/video/195356696?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0"" title=""Featured Video"" frameborder=""0"" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen loading=""lazy""> <a href=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/195356696?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0"">A video on Vimeo</a> </iframe> </div> </div> </div></p>

<p>We are eager to support Massachusetts secondary educators through this NGLC partnership as they grapple with how to ensure that all students have access to a meaningful high school education that prepares and empowers them to enter a range of post-secondary options. We know that the demands of the 21st-century society and economy are rapidly evolving and that too few of our secondary institutions are keeping up.</p>

<p>While Massachusetts has a lot to be proud of, not all students are connecting to success in or beyond high school. For example, according to data from the Massachusetts Department of Elementary Education, approximately 35% of Massachusetts high school graduates need to take remedial coursework when they enroll in a public postsecondary institution, and this number increases to 48% when focusing on low-income graduates. Given the high school graduation rate increases the Commonwealth has accomplished in recent years, local educators now have an opportunity to build off this success to ensure that all students are fully prepared for life after high school.</p>

<p>Through our recent <a href=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/126/attachments/EducationSurvey_results.pdf?1490907965"">survey</a> of practitioners across New England we learned that there is high interest in connecting and learning with and from others across the region. In particular, stakeholders expressed enthusiasm for visits to other high schools and networking with peers.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--committed""> <p>are</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>As part of our <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/education-regional"">Education strategy</a> to support new secondary school models that develop the full range of student competencies necessary for successful transitions to college and career, we are committed to opportunities for stakeholders in our region to explore new ideas together. Facilitated site visits provide educators with tangible examples of what’s possible in public education.</p>

<p>And a lot is possible. There is no one model that exemplifies next-generation learning; rather, there are myriad approaches to delivering personalized, student-centered learning opportunities. The Mass Learning Excursions will showcase a diverse set of school designs that are meeting the needs of their students and preparing them for post-secondary success.</p>

<p>Our own experience tells us that these visits will help develop a network of like-minded practitioners and inspire local action: in January, Barr hosted a group of about 30 educators and partners at the <a href=""http://www.linkedlearning.org"">Linked Learning</a> Convention in California. Participants shared through a follow-up survey that the school visit portion of the conference was a key component of the trip and an essential activity to inspire and inform local next steps. As stated by one school leader, “The school visit was definitely the highlight. It was great to see Linked Learning in action and to hear from students about their experiences.” Attendees also shared that the opportunity to visit as a team from their school and to connect with participants from other communities greatly enhanced the value of the trip.</p>

<p>We encourage Massachusetts educators interested in secondary school excellence to check out the details of the <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BpceoLSdzQCvNifrxtm1kDu-hU_BpVR50gc4NVqzAcU/edit"">Mass Learning Excursions</a> and consider applying for sponsored participation in one or more of the trips. Applications are due by July 1 and will be evaluated based on the quality of the proposed team and the responses to the question prompts.</p>

<p>We look forward to learning and sharing alongside Massachusetts educators and NGLC staff on these exciting visits.                  </p>

299,Investing in New Spaces for Artists and Creative Innovators,"<p>Barr contributes $1.965 million for planning, development, and build-out of new arts-related collaborative workspaces across Massachusetts.</p>","<p><em>Earlier this week, Jim Canales was at Gateway City Arts in downtown Holyoke, Massachusetts, joining Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito, MassDevelopment CEO Marty Jones, and Holyoke Mayor Alex Morse to announce a new partnership and RFP for the creation of arts-related collaborative workspaces in cities across the Commonwealth. Here are Jim’s remarks.</em></p>

<p>I am delighted to join you today on behalf of the Barr Foundation. </p>

<p>At Barr, we strongly believe that arts and creativity are essential for vibrant, vital, and engaged communities.</p>

<p>Many of us have experienced the power of arts and creativity in our own lives and how they enrich our communities.</p>

<p>The arts connect us to our cultures and our history, to meaning and purpose, and, at their best, to one another.
We also depend on artists and creative innovators to challenge the status quo, to provoke us to new ways of thinking and doing, and to inspire us on the issues we care about.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--on""> <p>depend</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>But, that is not all the arts do for our communities.</p>

<p>The arts and creative industries are also a large and growing part of our economy. Indeed, as just one illustration, the <a href=""https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/05/14/tanglewood-economic-engine-for-berkshires-study-says/bCMgzSYphOQcl1q1Et2dOK/story.html""><em>Boston Globe</em> reported</a> this week that the Tanglewood summer music festival alone generates $103 million in economic activity for the Berkshires each year.</p>

<p>So, we know that smart investments in the arts and creative sectors brings many benefits, including economic ones. And—as Lieutenant Governor Polito’s presence here attests—how fortunate we are to have leadership in Massachusetts that recognizes that.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--in""> <p>investments</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>When you talk to artists and creative professionals and ask what they need to be successful, one of the great needs they often point to is physical space—space to create, collaborate, do their work, and bring their visions to life.</p>

<p>That is why Barr is so pleased to join with the Commonwealth and MassDevelopment in response to that tangible need through the <a href=""http://www.massdevelopment.com/what-we-offer/financing/grants/collaborative-workspace-program"">Collaborative Workspace Program</a>.</p>

<p>We are excited about the potential of this program to benefit the arts sector directly. We are also enthusiastic about the potential to integrate arts and creativity in other sectors, such as planning, economic development, and community development.</p>

<p>These spaces will serve as cauldrons of creativity, enabling small-scale manufacturing and fostering entrepreneurship in ways that will revitalize economies and keep our state at the forefront of innovation.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--will""> <p>spaces</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>And these spaces will also create opportunities for learning and creative expression that are open to residents, fostering a sense of welcome and community.</p>

<p>So, it is my pleasure to announce the Barr Foundation’s grant of $1,965,000 to MassDevelopment for the planning, development, and build-out of arts-related collaborative workspaces.</p>

<p>MassDevelopment brings deep expertise to this work and a suite of economic tools to nurture and grow Massachusetts’ creative economy. Through the Transformative Development Initiative and the Cultural Facilities Fund, MassDevelopment has proven itself a leader, and is well positioned to continue strengthening this growing field, adding muscle to the arts and creative industries as a major economic force.</p>

<p>We are excited to see what emerges from this partnership.</p>

297,Three Boston Congregations Team Up for Community Solar Project,"<p>Reverend Mariama White-Hammond, a Class of 2009 Barr Fellow, shares three lessons and a new video documenting a novel collaboration of three churches committed to action on climate change and equity.</p>","<p>Three Boston congregations recently joined forces to put solar panels on their rooftops, capable of producing 70 kilowatts of clean energy to power our congregations. This is equivalent to the amount of electricity required to power about eight homes. Just as the project was getting started, cuts to the state solar compensation program almost killed the project, but we persevered through anyway.</p>

<p>I’m incredibly proud of Second Church (Dorchester), the Church of St. Augustine and St. Martin (South End), and Bethel AME Church (Jamaica Plain), and the staff at Resonant Energy, for our collective hard work and determination to make this project possible. </p>

<p>As people of faith we are asking the question: how can we be stewards of the earth and tackle urgent problems like climate change while also addressing equity issues? Solar on our churches is one great way to start. Our congregation has already invested in exploring how to reduce our impact on the planet in many ways, including water conservation, recycling, and energy efficiency. We saw playing a leadership role in solar energy as another way to walk the talk.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--of""> <p>people</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>In addition to producing clean energy, a solar installation has many other benefits: it shows us how solar works, lets our community members and our leaders experience it, and illustrates how clean energy can provide additional benefits to our community, like good jobs. This is why we chose solar installers based on their track record of hiring people of color, including someone who lives right in our church’s neighborhood. I’m excited to share this video that we produced to document the project:</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full""> <div class=""u-fluid-iframe""> <div class=""u-fluid-iframe-inner""> <iframe src=""//player.vimeo.com/video/209774037?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0"" title=""Featured Video"" frameborder=""0"" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen loading=""lazy""> <a href=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/209774037?badge=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=%23141B4D&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0"">A video on Vimeo</a> </iframe> </div> </div> </div></p>

<p>In reflecting on the project, which took about 15 months, we learned many things. Here are my three main takeaways from the project:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First, <strong>we must take leadership</strong>. Our project allows our churches to demonstrate how to contribute to reducing pollution, increasing resilience, and bringing economic benefits to our communities. We learned lessons that we can share with other churches and institutions that want to contribute to clean energy solutions and produce local energy. We are also helping our congregations to think more about the impact that our energy use has on the planet—and on people. We also thought a lot about how local projects like this one <strong>catalyze excitement and a sense of ownership</strong>, demonstrating what we can do when we work together collectively. People are so proud of our leadership role.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, it is important to provide <strong>tangible local examples</strong> for everyone in our community to see that what is possible. Local projects can catalyze excitement and a sense of ownership. Addressing climate change can seem like an overwhelming task for an individual or a congregation, and many people think that small actions don’t make a difference—but I firmly believe that they do. We must have examples in our communities—all of them—to show that clean energy is readily available, affordable, and accessible. We need more churches, businesses, institutions, public agencies, and others to use their buying power to show that this is possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Third, <strong>the “just transition” to clean energy must be a priority for everyone</strong> working to address climate change. To rapidly deploy the amount of clean energy that is needed to meet our climate goals, we must work together to ensure that all members of our community can share in the benefits of clean energy. It is my view that when we are working on clean energy policies and projects, we must be truly inclusive and make sure that <strong>communities are driving progress together</strong>. And we must understand that climate progress without good jobs, safe housing, and access to health care leaves many people out. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I’m a climate activist. I recognize that putting up solar panels on a few churches is just one step; we have many, many more to go. But this project allows people to see that each of us can be—and must be—part of the green revolution, for our planet and for our neighbors.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--allows""> <p>project</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Next, we’re going to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Help our members learn more about what they can do to reduce their energy use and invest in renewable energy to keep our momentum going.</li>
<li>Share the video with other congregations to encourage them to go solar. We shared it in March for a gathering of 23 congregations and we are scheduled to share with other local and national faith gatherings this year.</li>
<li>Seek solutions for more challenging questions like: how can we get the solar revolution to reach renters and low-income communities? How do we get more solar panels in our community on other buildings? </li>
<li>Educate policymakers and local leaders. We have joined with other congregations and nonprofits to support policies that provide strong incentives for low-income shared solar. We are proud that state Representative Russell Holmes and state Senator Chang-Díaz (each has one of our churches in his or her district) are stepping forward to lead on these issues.</li>
</ul>

<p>As my friend Alphonse Knight of Second Church in Dorchester said, “the Church is the foundation of the community; it’s where people grow and develop values. When something positive happens here, everyone in the community sees it. Now, we can see the church’s commitment to stewardship right here on our roof.”</p>

<p>As faith leaders, we will keep working to ensure that everyone benefits from the green revolution—especially those who are hit hardest by climate change while contributing least to the problem. We hope that you will join us.</p>

296,Twelve Designs Reimagine the Boston Bus Stop,<p>Michael Kodransky of ITDP reveals ideas for innovative bus stations in Boston and calls on the public to vote for their favorite design.</p>,"<p>ITDP recently partnered with the Barr Foundation and BostonBRT to <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/boston-brt-bus-station-design-competition"">challenge the architecture and design community</a> to think beyond the traditional bus stop. What if Boston built Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) stations that were enjoyable places to be―full of art, with real-time travel information, and safe from the elements? These BRT stations, along with other elements of Gold Standard BRT, can transform the transit experience.</p>

<p>We are excited to share 12 unique designs that were submitted as part of the competition. They showcase a range of visions for how BRT stations can become an integral part of the mobility and street experience in Boston. The images offer a wide range of ideas for how state-of-the-art BRT stations might look, delivering a world-class transit experience that includes public art, solar panels, and green landscaping. Imagine how one day these BRT stations might be the new nexus of a neighborhood and a core gathering place for public life.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--one""> <p>how</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Submissions came from local, national, and international student architects and design firms. They demonstrate covered stations and walkways for protection from weather elements, and integration with the streetscape, walking, cycling, and bus lane alignment. In addition, they showcase amenities such as bike parking, maps and wayfinding, digital marquees with announcement and real time service information, seating, and public space components.</p>

<p>Images of the designs, as well as summaries of the designers’ visions can be viewed and voted on through the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/BosBRT/photos/?tab=album&album_id=422086624816676"">BostonBRT Facebook page</a>.

295,Proven Early College Program to Double its Reach in New England ,<p>Gateway to College National Network president outlines a funding opportunity for new partnerships between New England colleges and K–12 school districts.</p>,"<p>Nearly 15 years ago, Gateway to College National Network (GtCNN) began replicating an innovative early college program featuring intensive support for 16- to 21-year-olds who have dropped out of high school or are not on track to graduate. Since that time, dozens of additional communities have come to appreciate the needs of the nearly one million young people who leave high school without a diploma each year. The Gateway program has been replicated in more than 40 communities and GtCNN now spans 21 states.</p>

<p>While the challenge of youth disconnection remains, Gateway to College programs have demonstrated a pathway back to education and renewed hope for thousands of vulnerable youth who have not only completed high school, but graduated with more than 20 college credits and momentum toward college and career success.   </p>

<p>Mount Wachusett Community College in Gardner, Massachusetts, launched the first New England-based Gateway to College program in 2006, and since that time, the program has expanded statewide, providing the only early college option to out-of-school and off-track high school students in the region. <a href=""http://www.gatewaytocollege.org/find-a-program.html"">Six communities in Massachusetts</a> currently offer the Gateway to College program as an opportunity for struggling school students to return to education through a college-based program. However, with more than <a href=""http://www.measureofamerica.org/DY2017/#State"">160,000 disconnected youth</a> in New England, more programs are needed.</p>

<p>Thanks to generous support from the Barr Foundation, GtCNN is poised to double the number of communities in New England offering this program by 2018, and we are pleased to announce a Request for Applications (RFA) for a new round of funding and technical assistance to launch three Gateway to College programs in New England.</p>

<p>Gateway to College National Network (GtCNN) invites applications from colleges, school districts, and charter schools across New England interested in forming new partnerships that would begin to serve students in fall 2018. Through this application, communities will receive $150,000 in funding for planning and initial program start-up costs, as well as no-cost training, coaching, and technical assistance from GtCNN during an 18-month planning and implementation period.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--College""> <p>to</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Applications are due to GtCNN by June 30. Information about the RFA, supplemental materials, and upcoming webinars can be found at <a href=""http://www.gatewaytocollege.org/new-england-rfa.html"">gatewaytocollege.org/new-england-rfa</a>.</p>

<p>Gateway to College programs, once they are serving students, are sustainable through local partnerships, leveraging K–12 per-pupil funding and the facilities of postsecondary institutions to deliver supportive, high-quality, alternative pathways to young people who are unlikely to achieve success in traditional high schools.</p>

<p>GtCNN is proud to partner with Barr, and we appreciate the close alignment with the Foundation’s new <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/education"">education strategies</a> (announced in March 2016), focused on connecting students throughout New England to success in high school and beyond. In particular, GtCNN encourages communities to recognize that, in order to effectively prepare all students for high school completion and postsecondary success, multiple pathways are crucial for meeting the diverse needs of their students—a strategy reflected in <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/what-is-personalized-learning-anyway"">Barr’s support of personalized learning</a>.</p>

<p>Early college and similar dual-enrollment partnerships are increasingly being recognized across New England and around the nation as excellent strategies to increase college readiness and postsecondary matriculation for first-generation and low-income students. And, at the same time, many communities and states have established priorities to re-engage students who have dropped out of high school or who are not on track to graduate.</p>

<p>As these two key movements gain traction in New England, GtCNN is eager to assist communities in addressing both priorities with one effective, sustainable program model.</p>
<h4>Gateway to College National Network</h4>
<p>GtCNN is a national, college-based dual-enrollment program for off-track and out-of-school youth. It designs and supports programs and initiatives aimed at building pathways for disconnected youth to earn a high school diploma and meaningful college credential. GtCNN is the national leader in bridging the aspiration and attainment gap for our most vulnerable young people.</p>
<h4>Gateway to College New England</h4>
<p>In 2017 GtCNN selected two new Gateway sites in New England at Roger Williams University in Providence, RI and at North Shore Community College in Lynn, MA. These new programs join the existing six Gateway programs in Massachusetts: Brockton (Massasoit Community College), Central Massachusetts (Mount Wachusett Community College and Quinsigamond Community College), the South Coast (Bristol Community College), and the Pioneer Valley (Holyoke Community College and Springfield Technical College). Collectively, these eight sites will serve more than 600 students, and the sites are supported by a new GtCNN position of New England Regional Director.</p>"
294,"“If I made anyone here uncomfortable, you’re welcome.”",<p>Three lessons in great communications from a philanthropy leadership conference.</p>,"<p>Leadership is hot these days. Everywhere we look, there are new books, conferences, trainings, and talking heads sounding off on the topic. So, why is public trust in our leaders so in the pits?</p>

<p>Phil Buchanan, president of the Center for Effective Philanthropy (CEP), posed this question last week to an audience of foundation leaders at CEP’s biennial conference. The conference is geared to foundation presidents, CEOs, and board members — most of the 400-plus individuals in the room fit that bill. But they also tolerate a few hangers-on. And I am glad they do, as the learning, inspiration, and questions we grappled with over three days in Boston have relevance beyond the C-suite and boardroom, including in my domain — communications.</p>

<p>When I heard Phil’s question, I first thought, that’s a leadership — not a communications — issue. No matter how skillful, communications can’t fix bad leadership. We might derive a perverse pleasure watching an official spokesperson tap dance through trying to justify the unjustifiable, but their spin can’t make their boss rise in our esteem. Only actual leadership can do that. The show, not the tell.</p>

<p>Yet, undeniably, one hallmark of great leadership is great communications. And what became clear to me last week were at least three ways all great leaders communicate:</p>

<h3>Great leaders communicate to understand.</h3>
<p>When Bryan Stevenson — lawyer, executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative, and author of Just Mercy — opened the conference, he urged us to “get proximate” to the problems we’re trying to solve and the people we’re trying to help. This is important not only because it is the most effective way to reach our target audiences with our messages and solutions, but because it is the only way to understand well enough to actually help.</p>

<p>How often our communications leap to persuading and influencing, rather than first understanding. We would do well to recall that the origins of the word “communications” are not about broadcasting at all, but rather about connection and relationships, shared understanding, and “making common.”
That’s why the words “community” and “communications” are so close. Great leaders know this.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1584/small.png?1642120269 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1584/medium.png?1642120269 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1584/large.png?1642120269 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1584/x_large.png?1642120269 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""leadership communications "" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1584/small.png?1642120269"" /> </div> </div></p>

<p>Whether out in our communities, in the office, or even in the boardroom, great leaders set a context for two-way communications and meaningful, authentic engagement that builds mutual understanding. Only then can all contribute their best thinking and aspirations and fully commit to the work of change.</p>
<h3>Great leaders communicate to create discomfort.</h3>
<p>We know there is a power in telling people what they want to hear. It wins clicks for bogus stories masquerading as news, votes for unscrupulous candidates, or grants for savvy nonprofits. Yet, we also know it is not a way to bring lasting, positive change. That takes courage to accept and communicate truths that not only “comfort the afflicted,” but “afflict the comfortable” — including those of us who work in philanthropy.</p>

<p>“Afflict” is the wrong word for how it felt watching Sarah Jones’s one-woman performance, <em>The Foundation</em>, at the conference. I was stunned by her depiction of a dozen different characters, reacting to the transfer of power from a beloved, progressive, and recently-deceased foundation founder to his conservative, financier son. Encountering inspired art can hardly be described as an “afflicting” experience. Yet, what Jones did so effectively was stir a constructive discomfort for her audience. “If I made anyone here uncomfortable, you’re welcome,” says one of her characters, a Native American grantee of the fictional foundation. This work of art held a mirror up to philanthropy’s inescapably idiosyncratic, often hubristic, and always power-imbalanced reality.</p>

<p>So did a panel of truth-tellers, including Sacha Pfeiffer (<em>Boston Globe</em> investigative journalist), Vu Le (executive director of Rainier Valley Corps and author of nonprofitwithballs.com), Linsey McGoey (sociologist at the University of Essex, U.K., and author), and Grant Oliphant (Heinz Endowments president and CEP board chair), with Jim Canales facilitating. Their insights were discomfiting to be sure. Yet, if philanthropy cares about effectiveness and change, we need to create space for our critics to let us have it — to tell us where we fall short, when our processes undermine, and when our actions betray our values.</p>

<p>If we don’t have the courage to create discomfort, we are only apologists for the status quo. And if the powerful aren’t uncomfortable, what change can be expected?</p>
<h3>Great leaders communicate to inspire greatness in others.</h3>
<p>Early in their careers, some great leaders are propelled by narcissistic drive. Yet, they only become great after breaking free of its grip. In the conference’s closing plenary, historian and Harvard Business School Professor Nancy Koehn atomized the leadership lessons of Ernest Shackleton’s ill-fated Antarctic expedition. Driven by ambition to be first to the South Pole by foot, Shackleton ignored the unwelcome counsel of local whalers who knew the southern seas were unsafe to cross. Days later, Shackleton’s ship was trapped in sea ice, stranding him and his crew in the middle of the Weddell Sea. Ten months later, the ship was crushed and swallowed into the chilly depths.</p>

<p>Yet, out of that desperate situation, Shackleton’s greatness as a leader began to manifest. He set aside his personal ambition to reach the pole and instead committed to the singular goal of returning all his men home safely. From that point, every aspect of his communications centered on “we,” not “me,” including how he used food and drink to sustain spirits, kept doubters and dissenters close, and insisted all share in even the most menial tasks. This all contributed to a powerful sense of agency over their collective fate, and their eventual safe return.</p>

<p>The ultimate triumphs of great leaders depend upon them. Yet, these triumphs are not, ultimately, about them. And it shows in how great leaders communicate — seeking first to connect and understand, disrupting the status quo, and awakening greatness in others.</p>

292,Learning Beyond the Walls of Traditional High Schools,<p>Barr issues RFP for planning and design of schools situated within a wider learning ecosystem to promote college and career readiness.</p>,"<p>As part of the Barr Education Program’s <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/education-regional"">vision for secondary education</a>, we are committed to investing in innovative high school models that prepare all students for post-secondary success. To cultivate the competencies required for successful post-secondary transitions in today’s global economy and society, students need authentic learning opportunities that expose them to and immerse them in college, careers, and their communities. Schools that systematically engage with a wider learning ecosystem comprising the educational, business, and non-profit organizations within the surrounding communities can provide just such learning opportunities, yet must be designed fundamentally differently than their traditional counterparts.</p>

<p>We believe that all students are capable of achieving post-secondary success, and that in order to do so, they must have access to the types of learning opportunities and experiences that help to build the knowledge, skills, and competencies necessary for successful transitions to college and career. Rather than being insular, high schools need to connect with and capitalize on the assets within their surrounding communities in order to provide students with a comprehensive program of study that addresses the many facets of college and career readiness.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--need""> <p>schools</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Today, we are excited to release a <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/education/wider-learning-ecosystem-rfp"">request for proposals (RFP)</a> for the design of innovative models that blend the lines between school, college, career, and the community. This funding opportunity focuses on improving college and career readiness and post-secondary outcomes for New England youth by supporting the development of promising public high school models that provide learning opportunities outside the traditional classroom to all students as an integral component of the schools’ mission, design, and program of study.</p>

<p>The Barr Foundation seeks proposals focused on existing public high schools across New England that are interested in a planning and design phase to leverage the wider learning ecosystem to offer one or more of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Anytime-anywhere learning opportunities</strong> that enable students to participate in experiential learning and build social capital in the community; and augment the school’s capacity to provide comprehensive, holistic programs of study.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Career development</strong> experiences that promote students’ awareness of their interests and options, and deepen student engagement in school through connecting the relevance of their coursework to their future plans.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Early college</strong> experiences that expose students to the environment of post-secondary education and enable students to earn college credits while completing the requirements for their high school diploma.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Our goal is to spur innovation across the region toward the planning and implementation of public, whole-school educational models that transcend the school walls in order to help all students develop the competencies required for a 21st-century definition of student success. We recognize that to do this, schools must form strong, strategic partnerships with external organizations and institutions that will share the responsibility for providing students with a set of rich, robust, and diverse learning experiences.</p>

<p>We invite eligible applicants to prepare a proposal for a grant of up to $300,000 for a planning and design phase lasting up to two years. Applicants may submit a proposal focused on one or more existing high schools in New England. We expect to fund up to 10 grantees. Barr will accept proposals until June 14, 2017.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the planning and design phase, grant recipients will have developed feasible, actionable designs for their whole-school models. Based on the quality of the design, planning grant recipients may be invited to apply for an implementation grant.</p>

<p>We know that there are many innovative practices and approaches throughout New England currently underway, and we are excited to support the development and expansion of learning opportunities that enable all students to engage with the wider learning ecosystem.</p>

291,A Neuroscientist Walks into a Museum…,<p>How brain science is helping the Peabody Essex Museum transform its visitor experience.</p>,"<p>At a time when museum attendance is declining around the country, the <a href=""http://www.pem.org"">Peabody Essex Museum (PEM)</a> is experimenting with new ways to engage and build its audiences—drawing on lessons from neuroscience to reshape its exhibits. “If one’s committed to creating more meaningful and impactful art experiences, it seems a good idea to have a better idea about how our brains work,” said Dan Monroe, the museum’s CEO, in a <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/11/arts/how-to-get-the-brain-to-like-art.html"">recent <em>New York Times</em> interview</a>. “That was the original line of thinking that started us down this path.”</p>

<p>PEM began consulting with neuroscientists and applying research-based design strategies with its <em>Native Fashion Now</em> exhibit in 2014 and <em>Asia in Amsterdam</em> in 2015. Such exhibits (and several more since) have incorporated interactive experiences; multiple senses, including touch and smell; interpretive information in unusual, unexpected formats (like questions rather than answers for visitors); and spatial design that encourages lingering or provides a moment of rest. In 2016, <em>Rodin: Transforming Sculpture</em> incorporated dancers to illuminate the artist’s kinetic studio practice. A Childe Hassam show included an area with rocking chairs and sounds from the Isles of Shoals that evoked the artist’s milieu while providing visitors an invitation to pause, sit, rock, listen, and reflect.</p>

<p>Beyond experimentation with new exhibit techniques, PEM is investing time into gathering data and evaluating what works well, and what is less effective. Members of PEM’s education and curatorial teams spend hours observing visitors’ interactions with, and reactions to each exhibit. What is their path? Where do they linger? Do they talk to each other or to museum staff? This data, aggregated and analyzed, has already begun to inform the design of following exhibitions.</p>

<p>With support from a recent Barr grant, PEM will deepen its research into those areas of neuroscience that are directly applicable to cognition, engagement, and the design of art experience—then apply, evaluate, and disseminate what it learns. As part of this work, PEM is recruiting three neuroscientists to serve as its Neuroscience Advisory Group, which will inform and guide PEM’s leadership and design team. In addition, PEM is hiring a full-time research manager to help interpret relevant research for PEM staff, as well as share findings with the broader art museum field.</p>

<p>The National Endowment for the Arts <a href=""https://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/2012-sppa-feb2015.pdf"">notes</a> that over the last 15 years, art museum attendance has declined 20%, with drops in every demographic and age group except those 75 or older. As attendance at most art museums falls, it is clear that the field needs new tools to engage changing audiences. If PEM’s experiments are successful, a stagnating museum industry stands to gain a new set of research-based, high-quality, transformative ways for audiences to engage with the arts. And we are pleased to support PEM’S continued exploration of how science can inform and enrich art, and its pushing of boundaries about what the museum visitor can experience.</p>

289,We’re Calling on Cities to Lead the Way to Better Transit,<p>Mary Skelton Roberts shares an opportunity for communities to pilot elements of Gold Standard Bus Rapid Transit. </p>,"<p>In cities such as Medellín, Colombia; Mexico City, Mexico; Cleveland, Ohio, and many others across the globe, bus rapid transit (BRT) has become integral to multi-modal, modern transportation systems. BRT is linking people throughout their cities to the places they need to go, and in the process, is supporting revitalization in commercial centers that surround this mode of transit.</p>

<p>If there’s one thing we’ve learned since <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/why-not-go-for-gold-in-boston"">Barr began exploring BRT in 2013</a>, it’s that the best BRT systems are unique, custom-designed to fit the transportation needs of their communities. We cannot fully grasp or model the potential of BRT unless cities and municipalities are engaged to conceptualize, right-size, and then try it out in their communities. But, what would that look like here in Massachusetts?</p>

<p>Now cities and towns throughout Massachusetts will have that chance to explore this question. <a href=""http://www.bostonbrt.org/home"">BostonBRT</a>, a research and community engagement initiative supported by the Barr Foundation, is seeking proposals to pilot BRT projects in Massachusetts. Through a <a href=""http://www.bostonbrt.org/pilot"">Request for Proposals (RFP)</a> process launched today, BostonBRT will provide technical, planning, and outreach support to selected grantees to advance projects piloting elements of BRT, with funding of up to $100,000 from Barr.</p>

<p>This initiative takes advantage of a powerful trait of BRT: it requires less change to city infrastructure compared to a streetcar or other heavy rail projects. That means core elements of BRT—level boarding, off-board payment, dedicated bus lanes—can be tested in real time, during the daily commute. With strategic support, we can better understand and demonstrate how this might work in our own communities.</p>

<p>It’s the perfect time to test this mode of transit here, as the concept of BRT has been gaining momentum over the past year or so. There are currently two pilot projects in the region to test elements of BRT, one in operation and another in the works.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--perfect""> <p>the</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>The City of Boston is planning, with the state, this spring to test many of the elements of gold standard BRT along the Washington Street Silver Line corridor in Chinatown. And the City of Everett, in a partnership with MassDOT (which you can read about in <a href=""https://www.citylab.com/commute/2017/02/when-street-parking-becomes-a-pop-up-bus-lane/517404/"">this CityLab article</a>), just completed a highly successful pilot.</p>

<p>There will be more opportunities to explore BRT in the future. The City of Boston recently released the <a href=""https://www.boston.gov/transportation/go-boston-2030"">Go Boston 2030</a> transportation plan, which proposes multiple BRT corridors across the area. And there may be other cities and municipalities throughout the Commonwealth considering BRT that Barr may not be aware of.</p>

<p>While gold standard BRT throughout the Commonwealth seems like a heavy lift right now, with the MBTA strapped for cash in the immediate future, MassDOT is making progress in improving the T’s financial situation. If Massachusetts is to remain economically competitive, we will need to pivot from fixing what’s broken to modernizing the transportation system to meet current and future needs of the Commonwealth’s residents.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--is""> <p>Massachusetts</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>When this shift happens, cities and towns with transportation projects that move people around efficiently, can be built at a reasonable cost, are resilient to our changing climate, and link to the existing transit network will have the advantage over others. Barr and our partners believe BRT fits this description. If you and your team are ready to take on the challenge, we hope you’ll review the <a href=""http://adhocind.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BostonBRT-request-for-pilot-3_20_17_.pdf"">full RFP here</a>.</p>

<p>This call for pilot projects is just one of a series of initiatives in which BostonBRT will invite our communities, our creative talent, and our transit riders to envision how BRT might work for them. Over the next several weeks, we’ll release more about these initiatives and you’ll have a chance to hear directly from some of the people working on them. </p>

<p>Want to give BRT a try in your community? We can’t wait to see what you come up with.</p>

288,Build a Better Bus Stop,<p>BostonBRT announces a design competition for innovative bus stations in Boston.</p>,"<p>What if Boston built bus stations that were enjoyable places to be―full of art, with real-time travel information, and safe from the elements? The daily commute would become less stressful and riders would have more faith in the bus system. Even on stormy days, bus riders would be warm and comfortable while waiting for the bus.</p>

<p>Such bus stations do exist. They are a key part of a high-quality bus rapid transit (BRT) system.</p>

<p>What could BRT stations look and feel like in Boston? Will they reflect Boston’s history and its future? How can design make them beautiful and functional? Our organization, the <a href=""https://www.itdp.org"">Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP)</a> is partnering with <a href=""http://www.bostonbrt.org"">BostonBRT</a> and the Barr Foundation to host a <a href=""http://www.bostonbrt.org/station-design-contest"">Station Design Competition</a>. The competition seeks creative visions for what a BRT station could look like in Boston.</p>

<p>Stations are where everything comes together in the BRT system. How easily passengers can navigate the design and the technologies built into the stations is of primary importance to the success of the system. But aside from making functional improvements to stations, like elevated boarding platforms and protection from the elements, cities have turned BRT stations into places people actually enjoy spending time by incorporating art, cafe kiosks, landscaping, green infrastructure, and tech features. Because while these stations are necessary to make the bus system run efficiently, they are ultimately places for people—and they should be designed for people.</p>
<h4>Successful entries in the Station Design Competition will include design concepts that:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Reflect the character of Greater Boston and its neighborhoods</li>
<li>Create a sense of comfort and elegance</li>
<li>Meet the requirements of the BRT Standard and maximizes benefits to future BRT riders</li>
<li>Allow for integration with other modes including walking and biking</li>
<li>Demonstrate an effective and reliable rapid transit system</li>
</ul>

<p>Entrants are asked to submit concept-level designs for center platform BRT stations (see the images below for some examples). Winners will receive cash prizes ($4,000 for first, $2,000 for second, and $1,000 for third place) and a travel package to ITDP’s international <a href=""http://www.mobilizesummit.org"">Mobilize Summit</a> in Santiago, Chile, taking place June 28–30, 2017. Interested parties must register by April 5 and submit entries by April 12. The winning design will be announced at an event on May 10.</p>

287,Lessons from High Schools Designed to Connect All Students to Success,"<p>To better understand options for students who are off track in the goal of graduating from high school, Barr commissioned Springpoint to visit a set of New England schools serving this population and to share their findings here.</p>","<p>We know that students thrive in environments that build on their strengths and allow them choice and voice in their learning. Nowhere is this more important than in schools serving students who are off track to graduate. These students arrive with varied skills, needs, and goals—and their school environment must be intentionally designed to meet them where they are.</p>

<p>To understand the current landscape of options for these students in New England—and the need for further solutions—the Barr Foundation asked Springpoint to visit a cluster of such high schools and to speak with local and national experts in the fields of school leadership, youth development, and school design. In these visits and conversations, we were compelled by the deep need for strong alternative education options in the region, and energized to hear about possible paths forward to create strong options that will work for students. Below are some of the most salient insights—but first, a bit of what the research tells us about the scope and urgency of this work.</p>
<h3>Current high schools are not designed to prepare today’s students for tomorrow.</h3>
<p>Across the United States, about 2.6 million young people are off track to graduate from high school. Further, each year, more than 1.2 million students drop out of high school in the United States. That’s one student every 26 seconds—or 7,000 students a day. All told, <a href=""http://www.issuelab.org/resource/what_factors_predict_high_school_graduation_in_the_los_angeles_unified_school_district"">about 25%</a> of high school freshmen fail to graduate from high school on time—and in pockets of New England those numbers are even higher. In Massachusetts alone, 55% of all high school students either don’t graduate or fail to connect successfully to post-secondary education.</p>

<p>When secondary schools are not equipped to meet their needs, far too many high school students experience failure. This impacts their trajectory after high school, presenting challenges as they move on to other opportunities. A young person who drops out of high school, for example, will <a href=""https://www.census.gov/prod/2002pubs/p23-210.pdf"">earn $200,000 less</a> over his or her lifetime than peers who complete high school, and almost a million dollars less than those who earn a college degree. Beyond earning potential, high school completion affects students’ fulfillment in life and their ability to contribute meaningfully to the world.</p>

<p>When students fall off track in traditional settings, it is critical that we provide environments that re-engage them in learning, address their unique needs, and create for them a sense of belonging at school. Research suggests these conditions are necessary for all students, particularly those who have fallen off track toward graduation, if they are to experience real academic achievement and ready themselves for college and career.</p>
<h3>School and system leaders have an opportunity to design schools that meet students where they are.</h3>
<p>Though the need is great, there is a small but growing cadre of schools and programs creating the conditions that allow these students to succeed. With intentionally-designed learning environments that address students’ academic, social, and developmental needs, these schools demonstrate that all young people can indeed succeed and thrive—if we support them in the right ways.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--people""> <p>young</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>From our site visits and conversations—along with our prior work—we know that the most successful schools focus on positive youth development as a central organizing principle. They fully recognize that young people’s ability to achieve academic success is interrelated with their development as young adults. They have structures, teaching strategies, and supports that intentionally reinforce these goals. They harness young people’s interests and focus resources in such a way that schools become positive catalysts for youth development.</p>
<h3>We’re learning how to create more options that work for students.</h3>
<p>Through our site visits and conversations, we heard strong support for expanding the options available to students who are off track. In the words of one national expert, “we need to start from the assumption that all students have assets. We need to create environments that recognize this as the jumping off point for working with students.”</p>

<p>These experts, along with school and system leaders, agree that in addition to a focus on asset-based instruction and positive youth development, schools that serve students who are off track to graduate should reflect the following design characteristics:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Intentional recruitment and enrollment.</strong> Students are often unaware of the supports available to them. The most successful schools proactively reach out to students and families.<br></li>
<li><strong>Access to small class sizes and individualized instruction.</strong> Small class sizes allow these programs to focus on individual students and to tailor instruction accordingly. Personalized learning offers tailored growth opportunities based on students’ skills and interests.<br></li>
<li><strong>The ability to earn credits quickly and on a flexible schedule.</strong> Many programs also included an opportunity for students to earn college credit as they completed their high school degree.<br></li>
<li><strong>An opportunity to see what is possible.</strong> Students who are off track need opportunities to clearly envision a future in which they are successful.<br></li>
<li><strong>Tutoring and remediation.</strong> Successful programs offer instruction periods outside of regular course offerings for tutoring and additional assistance.<br></li>
</ol>

<p>Overall, successful school models for students who are off track to graduate are able to provide the right balance of structure and autonomy, recognizing students’ independence as young people while still supporting them in reaching clearly articulated goals for the future. In the words of a principal of one of these schools, “A critical part of our work is the young person’s encounter with their own agency.”</p>
<h3>Together we can develop a network of schools that support all students.</h3>
<p>Though we are beginning to understand what works for students who are off track, there is more we can do to support the growth and development of school models designed to serve them. Many of the schools that currently serve students who are off track operate in isolation. Without a cohesive network, practitioners are unable to share best practices and build on each other’s work. One of the unifying themes in our conversations with practitioners was the need for a shared learning community to help develop, elevate, and improve high-quality secondary options for students off track to graduate in New England. As one school principal noted, “We have to incorporate the latest thinking into our school models so we are able to continuously accelerate outcomes for our students.”</p>

<p>Our goal in supporting <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/education/rfp"">Barr’s initiative</a> to create opportunities for students in New England who are off track to graduate is to help develop a thriving network of practitioners serving this population of young people. Together, these new models will build on one another’s strengths in order to powerfully demonstrate the impact of a student-centered, targeted, and supportive approach that addresses both the academic and developmental needs of these students. As they continue to grow and share best practices, we hope these schools will pave a path for educators in New England and across the country. </p>

285,Clean Energy Powers 3 Million U.S. Jobs,"<p>New research reveals a vibrant, new national industry and workforce.</p>","<p>What does an “energy worker” look like? A coal miner? An oil drill operator? A natural gas pipefitter? Certainly. However, in recent years, as entire industries—from construction and manufacturing to sales and professional services—are transformed by clean technologies, an entirely new group of “energy workers” has emerged that includes solar installers, wind turbine technicians, energy efficiency auditors, and others in the rapidly expanding clean energy sector.</p>
<h3>U.S. clean energy employment nears 3 million workers in 2017</h3>
<p>The most comprehensive statistical documentation of the clean energy workforce is found in last month’s <a href=""https://energy.gov/downloads/2017-us-energy-and-employment-report"">2017 U.S. Energy and Employment Report</a> from the U.S. Department of Energy. The report provides detailed employment data for electric generation, fuels, transmission, distribution, storage, energy efficiency, and motor vehicles sectors for all 50 states.</p>

<p>The report found that:</p>

<ul>

<p>The January 2017 publication is the second annual edition of the ground-breaking U.S. Energy and Employment Report. In 2016, national organizations E4TheFuture and Environmental Entrepreneurs (with support from The Barr Foundation) used data from the inaugural study as source material for the development of “<a href=""https://e4thefuture.org/1-9-million-energy-efficiency-jobs-in-u-s/"">Energy Efficiency Jobs in America</a>,” a detailed review of energy efficiency employment in all fifty states with breakdowns of energy efficiency jobs to the city, county, legislative and congressional district level.</p>

<p>The growth in clean energy employment is not surprising, given the unprecedented transition away from coal generation and the growth of natural gas and renewable electricity, as well as the proliferation of energy efficiency incentive programs offered by states and local utilities. The data show not only abundant new economic activity in research and development,
manufacturing, and construction of new capacity, but also a significant transition to energy efficiency work within traditional sectors. This is best illustrated by the fact that nearly 1.4 million of the nation’s 2.2 million energy efficiency (EE) workers are in construction-related EE jobs.</p>

<p>The impressive gains in national clean energy employment have not been equally distributed across the nation. It is no coincidence that states with progressive clean energy policies, incentives, and targets, such as California, Massachusetts, New York, and Texas, have seen the fastest job growth. In fact, the key to sustained growth appears to be diversity in both technology mix (e.g., wind, solar, biofuels, traditional energy) and industrial mix (e.g., R&amp;D, manufacturing, construction). The states with greater variety in their energy sectors have fared best over time.</p>

<p>Industry growth, coupled with continued declines in unemployment, has constricted the labor pool of qualified applicants, and employers report increased difficulty filling positions. In fact, nearly 80% of businesses nationwide report at least some difficulty filling their jobs.</p>

<p>At the same time, ethnic, racial, and gender participation in clean energy remains well below the norm. To address this concern, leading companies can be expected to expand the labor pool by sourcing talent from communities currently disconnected from job opportunities.</p>
<h3>Massachusetts is a national clean energy workforce leader</h3>
<p>For a profile of a vibrant clean energy sector in a single state, one could look at our own Commonwealth of Massachusetts. In 2016, the state’s <a href=""http://www.masscec.com/2016-massachusetts-clean-energy-industry-report-0"">annual clean energy industry report</a> found that the sector’s workforce topped 100,000 for the first time, with 105,212 workers at 6,714 different establishments—a 75% employment increase over the last six years.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1527/small.jpg?1642120149 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1527/medium.jpg?1642120149 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1527/large.jpg?1642120149 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1527/x_large.jpg?1642120149 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""CE job growth in MA"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1527/small.jpg?1642120149"" /> <div class=""FancyAttribution""> <p><a class=""FancyAttribution-link"" href=""http://www.masscec.com/"">MassCEC</a></p> </div> </div> </div></p>

<p>The Commonwealth’s clean energy sector now represents 2.9% of all state jobs. In 2015, the industry contributed $11.8 billion in economic activity, accounting for 2.5% of the Massachusetts GDP, helping the state lead the region in job growth.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1519/small.jpg?1642120135 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1519/medium.jpg?1642120135 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1519/large.jpg?1642120135 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1519/x_large.jpg?1642120135 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""Mass CEC"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1519/small.jpg?1642120135"" /> <div class=""FancyAttribution""> <p><a class=""FancyAttribution-link"" href=""http://www.masscec.com/"">MassCEC</a></p> </div> </div> </div></p>

<p>As 2016 came to an end, interest grew about <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/a-vital-piece-of-our-clean-energy-future-ready-for-primetime-energy-storage"">the expected rise of a major new energy storage sector</a> in the Commonwealth—the latest job-supporting addition to the state’s clean energy success story.</p>
<h3>The road ahead</h3>
<p>The nation’s clean energy industry—and the thousands of jobs in every state that come with it—is growing rapidly. Continuing that growth is both an economic and an environmental imperative, especially for states like Massachusetts, which have no domestic fossil fuels and are deeply committed to dramatically reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p>Accelerating the continued growth of the renewable and energy efficiency industries supports local jobs in deployment and construction; keeps money in local economies while at the same time developing vibrant new global exporting possibilities (particularly in professional services and in research and development); and contributes to improving the nation’s energy security.</p>

<p>We are fortunate that many of the drivers supporting clean energy growth are already embedded in the marketplace, especially through the significant declines in the cost of electricity produced from solar and wind, and the undeniable financial benefits that come from using less energy through efficiency and conservation.</p>

<p>Still, policy—including national policy—matters. President Trump and his Administration have said that increasing jobs for American workers will be a key concern for both energy and environmental policy. If jobs are a major part of the scorecard, policies that yield <a href=""https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23Cleanenergyjobs&src=typd"">#cleanenergyjobs</a> are the right call. </p>

<em>On February 22, a national coalition of more than 40 clean energy associations and organizations launched a social media campaign to “focus national attention on real people working in clean energy” campaign. The <a href=""http://info.aee.net/clean-energy-jobs"">#cleanenergyjobs campaign</a> is also promoting the findings of recent studies that verify the significant size, rapid growth, and job supporting power of the clean energy sector.</em></p>"
282,New England Chambers of Commerce Leading on Clean Energy,<p>Diane Doucette of Chambers for Innovation and Clean Energy shares five ways area businesses reaped the benefits of clean energy in 2016.</p>,"<p><em>In order to engage and amplify a broad range of voices supporting clean energy, Barr supports groups that help businesses take advantage of the economic benefits of growing the clean energy economy. We recently invited Diane Doucette, executive director of Chambers for Innovation and Clean Energy, to share highlights of business and chamber activity in two states in our region.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>Local chambers of commerce are the engines of economic growth for their communities, shaping the economic vitality of cities and towns. Every day, businesses large and small turn to local chambers for guidance and support. Many of these local chambers are helping businesses and communities meet shared challenges in our energy landscape: volatile energy prices, global competition in manufacturing, technology development, and aging electric grids. Time and again, clean energy has proven to be a practical and profitable solution for these chambers and their member companies.</p>

<p>Market-based clean energy solutions allow businesses to find the most cost-effective measures to spur innovation, encourage investment, and advance clean energy. Here in New England, business leaders understand this. In 2016, more than half of all local chamber leaders in Massachusetts and Connecticut alone pursued clean energy opportunities, engaging in energy efficiency and solar energy programs, and educating themselves and their members about the growing economic opportunities in clean energy.</p>

<p>Here are five highlights from 2016 from Massachusetts and Connecticut members of the <a href=""http://www.chambersforinnovation.com"">Chambers for Innovation and Clean Energy</a> network:</p>
<h3>Chambers Help Businesses Achieve Efficiency Savings</h3>
<p><div class=""Media -aside -left""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img alt=""Chambers for Innovation Main Street"" class=""Media-image"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/crop/1701/fullscreen_crop.jpg?1529011871"" /> </div> </div></p>

<p>Piloted at the Newton-Needham Regional Chamber in Massachusetts, a new chamber initiative led to almost 300 new businesses signing up for efficiency audits through the ratepayer-funded <a href=""http://www.masssave.com"">Mass Save</a> program. More than 250 have already received an assessment and more than 100 have committed to upgrades.</p>

<p>Said Chamber President Greg Reibman: “Reducing our carbon footprint is not just good for our planet, it can be good for the bottom line. I’m proud of our businesses here for the way they’ve embraced this initiative.” <a href=""http://www.chambersforinnovation.com/c-i-a/thanks-to-local-chamber-more-than-140-new-businesses-join-mass-save-program"">More here</a>.  </p>
<h3>Chambers Connect Businesses with Policymakers to Explore Growing Offshore Wind Investments and Jobs</h3>

More than 50 local chamber executives and their member companies spoke with Massachusetts State Senator Pacheco and Representative Golden to discuss the Act to Promote Energy Diversity, also known as the 2016 Omnibus Energy bill. Of particular interest was how the legislation positions the Bay State to attract new investment and jobs associated with offshore wind.</p>
<h3>Chambers Launch Solar Program to Help Businesses Become Energy Independent</h3>

<p>A new solar program, housed at the Metro South Chamber, has attracted commitments from more than a dozen other chambers to encourage their member businesses to purchase solar energy. More than 200 businesses have already shown interest.</p>
<h3>Chambers Connect Businesses to Policymakers to Express Strong Interest in Clean Energy</h3>
<p><div class=""Media -aside -left""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img alt=""Chambers for Innovation and Clean Energy"" class=""Media-image"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1508/crop_preview.jpg?1642120111"" /> </div> </div></p>

<p>Twenty-six local chambers of commerce, covering half of all local chambers in Connecticut, gathered for a conversation about clean energy with Governor Dannel P. Malloy, the Connecticut Green Bank, and the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.</p>

<p>“We see clean energy as a great economic development opportunity that helps us retain and attract businesses,” said Rich Brown, vice president of the MetroHartford Alliance and event co-host.</p>
<h3>Chamber Executives Line Up to Test Electric Vehicles</h3>
<p><div class=""Media -aside -left""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img alt=""Chambers for Innovation"" class=""Media-image"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1509/crop_preview.jpg?1642120112"" /> </div> </div>
New England Chamber Executives got behind the wheel of a new Nissan electric vehicle at the 2016 New England Association of Chamber of Commerce Executives meeting in New Hampshire. A growing number of local chambers are now looking into leasing electric vehicles or getting a charging station to encourage more traffic to their businesses.</p>

<p><strong>About Chambers for Innovation and Clean Energy</strong><br>
A national network of local chambers of commerce focused on clean energy (primarily energy efficiency, renewable energy, and innovative financing mechanisms), Chambers for Innovation and Clean Energy works at the national level and in states to educate, connect, and empower local business leaders to support clean energy policies and to participate in clean energy projects. It has about 1,000 local chambers in itsnetwork, representing hundreds of thousands of business from every state in the nation. With Barr Foundation support, it has deepened its support for New England chambers. In addition to its national network of chamber leaders, it supports chamber networks in states where local chamber leadership wishes to partner.

280,Barr Renews Commitment to Signature Leadership Program,<p>Next class of Barr Fellows to be named in mid-2017; Kimberly Haskins takes new role overseeing the Fellowship and other Cross-Program Initiatives.</p>,"<p>Since its launch more than 10 years ago, the <a href=""http://www.barrfoundation.org/fellows"">Barr Fellowship</a> has recognized and supported 58 extraordinary Boston-area leaders. We are excited to take a number of steps to extend and strengthen our commitment to this work, including naming Kimberly Haskins to serve as the lead staff person for the Fellowship, as part of her assuming a new role advancing our <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/cross-program-initiatives"">Cross-Program Initiatives</a> grantmaking.</p>
<h3>A Moment to Reflect on a Decade of Investing in Leaders</h3>
<p>Given the Fellowship’s history, the growth in the Fellows network, the Foundation’s refined strategies, and the evolution of the broader context for our work, we felt it was an important moment to reflect on the program and to explore opportunities to strengthen it. To do this, we spoke to Barr Fellows about their experiences—what they valued most and what could make it better. We reviewed past assessments. We examined other national models and spoke to colleagues running varied leadership programs.</p>

<p>In light of all this, in conversations with Barr staff and trustees, we revisited the Fellowship’s core goals and components. In the end, this process led us to reconfirm the original goals of the program and to identify a few important refinements I am happy to share today.</p>
<h3>What Won’t Change</h3>
<p>The goals of the Barr Fellowship remain to:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Recognize and reward accomplished leaders</strong> by providing an opportunity for personal and professional rejuvenation.</li>
<li><strong>Strengthen organizations</strong> by providing resources to develop and enhance leadership across Fellows’ organizations.</li>
<li><strong>Build civic leadership</strong> for Boston by fostering a strong network of leaders.</li>
</ul>

<p>In our conversations with Fellows, it has been inspiring to hear them reflect on these goals and how they played out in their own experiences. Many spoke of the deep meaning and value of the Fellowship both professionally and personally. They described the international learning journey as a transformative experience, disrupting their thinking, and building deep bonds with other Fellows. They were also grateful for the chance (indeed, the requirement) to disconnect from their organizations and recharge, allowing them to return with fresh perspectives and confidence.</p>

<p>Beyond the impact on them personally, many Fellows also described how their organizations had cultivated a deeper “bench strength” and a more distributive approach to leadership. New partnerships and initiatives have emerged over the Fellowship’s first decade, such as the Margarita Muñiz Academy and the Boston Promise Initiative.</p>

<p>These conversations, and other aspects of our review, made clear the positive impacts of many core elements of the program, which will continue, such as the learning journey, sabbatical, organizational support, and particularly the fundamental principle of focusing first on relationships, rather than on a specific agenda for collaborative projects.</p>
<h3>What’s New</h3>
<p>The review also illuminated several areas where we could enhance the program to ensure its continued vibrancy and relevance. We will take a number of new steps as we begin our work to identify the Barr Fellowship Class of 2017 (which we plan to announce this summer). Among those steps, we will:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Expand the pool of nominators and establish a broader, rotating membership for the Selection Committee.</strong> During our review, we considered creating an open application process to ensure a breadth of applications. However, Fellows strongly encouraged us to keep the nomination process confidential in order to minimize competition or advocacy for candidates, or to advantage leaders from one type or size of organization over another. Our broader pool of nominators and Selection Committee members will help us access more candidates while maintaining the strengths of the process.</li>
<li><strong>Increase transparency about the process.</strong> For the first time, we are making public on the <a href=""http://www.barrfoundation.org/fellows"">Fellowship page</a> of our website the eligibility and selection criteria, as well as the composition of the Selection Committee.</li>
<li><strong>Include select leaders from outside the nonprofit sector.</strong> To increase the potential impact of the Fellowship, with the 2017 class we are piloting the inclusion of leaders from public agencies, for-profit social enterprises, and faith-based organizations.</li>
<li><strong>Provide greater investment and more targeted support to Fellows and their organizations.</strong> We will enhance the amount of flexible resources provided for Fellows’ organizations. We will enrich the content of professional development offered through the Fellowship—in particular, adding a greater focus on system change and cross-sector collaboration, as well as a greater share of Fellows-directed activities.</li>
<li><strong>Provide more focused, ongoing staff support</strong> that will, among other things, facilitate greater intentionality around activities of the Fellows Network.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Strengthening Staff Leadership</h3>
<p>We are very pleased to have Kimberly Haskins step into a new role as senior program officer for Cross-Program Initiatives. In this role, she will provide the focused staff support mentioned above and help shape and advance our (still relatively new) Cross-Program Initiatives strategies, particularly in the areas of leadership and sound decision-making. Kim has covered a number of responsibilities at Barr since joining the Foundation in 2003, most recently focused on our early childhood education portfolio, but also previously including a role with the Barr Fellowship. In addition to her significant contributions at the Foundation, she has held roles with United Way of Massachusetts Bay and in the corporate sector, and brings deep knowledge of the Boston community, where she has also earned deep respect. To help the Education team advance its <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/education"">new strategies</a>, we will soon initiate a search for a new senior program officer.</p>

<p>In my first six months at the Barr Foundation, one of the greatest privileges for me has been to meet with Barr Fellows and to see firsthand the abundant evidence of their tremendous leadership and commitment to our communities. We are eager to continue investing in and supporting this growing network of leaders for many years to come.</p>"
279,Buses Are What’s Next in Transportation,"<p>This article was originally published in the Opinion section of Commonwealth Magazine on January 23, 2017.</p>","<p>But only if streets are reprogrammed for bus rapid transit.</p>

<p>You wait 20 minutes for a bus, only to watch three show up all at once. Soon after boarding, the glut of vehicles carrying hundreds of commuters comes to a grinding halt as one driver up ahead waits an eternity to make a left turn.</p>

<p>If you have ever taken a bus in Greater Boston, you know this scenario all too well. It is why many days it would be faster to just drive, bike, or—no joke—walk than take the bus.</p>

<p>In short, our streets are not designed to meet the needs of a modern city. Populations in Greater Boston and other cities are growing at breakneck speed, and people and employers are fleeing the suburbs for the urban core. Younger people, especially, want to more easily connect to the places they work, study, and play. They’re also far <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/01/the-decline-of-the-drivers-license/425169"">less eager</a> to get behind the wheel. But our streets have simply not kept up. They’re still designed with a 1950s-era prioritization of single-occupancy vehicles above all else. As a result, we’re all stuck in traffic.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--next""> are <a class=""Pullquote-cta"" href=""https://twitter.com/intent/tweet/?dnt=true&amp;text=what""> <svg width=""48"" height=""48"" viewBox=""628 -718 2048 2048"" class=""Icon"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg""> <path d=""M2417.2-86.6c1.2,17,1.2,33.9,1.2,50.9c0,517.3-393.8,1113.4-1113.4,1113.4c-221.7,0-427.7-64.2-601-175.7 c31.5,3.6,61.8,4.8,94.5,4.8c183,0,351.4-61.8,485.8-167.2c-172-3.6-316.2-116.3-365.9-271.4c24.2,3.6,48.5,6.1,73.9,6.1 c35.1,0,70.3-4.8,103-13.3C916.1,424.7,781.6,267.2,781.6,76.9c0-1.2,0-3.6,0-4.8c52.1,29.1,112.7,47.2,176.9,49.7 C853.1,51.5,784-68.4,784-204.2c0-72.7,19.4-139.3,53.3-197.5C1030-164.2,1319.6-9.1,1644.3,7.9c-6.1-29.1-9.7-59.4-9.7-89.7 c0-215.7,174.5-391.3,391.3-391.3c112.7,0,214.4,47.2,285.9,123.6c88.4-17,173.3-49.7,248.4-94.5c-29.1,90.9-90.9,167.2-172,215.7 c78.7-8.5,155.1-30.3,225.3-60.6C2560.2-211.4,2493.6-142.4,2417.2-86.6z""/> </svg> Tweet This </a> </blockquote></p>

<p>This disconnect presents both a challenge and an opportunity—cities are in a unique position to reshape our streets with people, not cars, as the focal point. And bold local leadership, working hand in hand with community groups, foundations, and state officials, can step up to make this kind of modern transportation system very real.</p>

<p>City and community leaders have a much bigger role to play in this transformation than you might expect. While state and regional entities operate most public transit systems, cities design and maintain the street networks on which above-ground transit runs. Leading cities around the world, and a growing number of municipalities here in Massachusetts, are realizing that better street design can make a big impact. Once streets are redesigned to move as many people as smoothly as possible, it opens the path for discovering new potential in an old workhorse—the city bus.</p>

<p>Currently, riding the bus can be slow, unpredictable, and downright unpleasant when buses are late, caught in traffic, and bunched together. But if streets are reprogrammed to reflect 21st Century priorities, buses can instead offer a reliable, efficient, and cost-effective transportation option to people in any neighborhood. The problem is that most people in US cities don’t realize how great buses could be if we thought differently about how to put them to good use.</p>

<p>That’s beginning to change, however, as more cities are turning to Bus Rapid Transit, or BRT, to reimagine their streets. BRT combines the capacity and speed of a light-rail system with the flexibility, affordability, and simplicity of a bus system. BRT, as defined by an international <a href=""https://www.itdp.org/library/standards-and-guides/the-bus-rapid-transit-standard"">BRT Standard</a>, is made up of five main features:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dedicated right-of-way gives the bus its own travel lane</strong>, ensuring it is never delayed due to traffic congestion</li>
<li><strong>Busway alignment</strong> in the center of the roadway keeps buses away from the busy curbside where cars are parking, standing, and turning</li>
<li><strong>Off-board fare collection</strong> eliminates the delay caused by passengers waiting to pay</li>
<li><strong>Intersection treatments</strong> prohibit cars from turning across the bus lane, which forces the bus to stop</li>

<p>BRT is only beginning to catch on in the United States, and the term is often inaccurately used to describe conventional bus service with minor improvements. But adopting all five features can transform street-level transportation, significantly reduce travel times, and drive economic development around rail-like BRT corridors.  Additional features, such as covered stations for waiting passengers, and Wi-Fi to keep passengers connected during their ride, would further persuade people to put down their car keys in favor of a transit pass.</p>

<p>Advancing such mobility solutions is also critical to meeting cities’ climate goals. Transportation recently surpassed electricity generation as the top greenhouse gas source in the country, and it’s the climate implications of transit that led to the Barr Foundation’s interest in BRT. To help Massachusetts meet its emissions reduction goals, Barr is supporting mobility initiatives across the spectrum of bikes, rail, and everything in between, including BRT. In the past few years, the foundation has been working closely with community and civic leaders in the Greater Boston region to research the possibilities for BRT here.</p>

<p>We’ve learned that buses hold vast untapped potential to improve urban life, and that local leaders are well suited to create the kind of streets where BRT can be fully utilized. There’s clearly tremendous public will, judging from a record number of local transit initiatives on ballots in 2016, <a href=""http://www.metro-magazine.com/government-issues/news/717585/voters-pass-33-of-46-transportation-ballot-measures"">more than 70 percent of which passed</a>. And while certain infrastructure changes will always require cooperation at multiple levels of government, city leaders can drive improvements with bold experiments in street design. We’re already seeing some such moves take shape here.</p>

<p>In Everett, Massachusetts, the <a href=""http://www.mbta.com/about_the_mbta/news_events/?id=6442457189&month=&year="">city and state partnered to pilot a dedicated bus lane</a>, separate from traffic—one of the five elements of BRT. The city of Boston is testing the waters of BRT, eyeing a possible pilot project of BRT elements on the Silver Line, and in other high-traffic corridors identified as having potential in the city’s <a href=""http://goboston2030.org/en"">Go Boston 2030</a> transportation plan.</p>

<p>In 2017 and beyond, the Barr Foundation and a coalition of partners will be encouraging local leadership in Greater Boston and other parts of the state to put these ideas to the test. We’re urging Boston and other municipalities across the state to follow through on exciting pilots, and when doing so, to pursue a high standard of BRT that will reap its full benefits. Furthermore, we are launching a campaign to partner with multiple municipalities and community organizations interested in exploring BRT as part of their transit planning.  For more information about this effort or to get involved, reach out to BostonBRT <a href=""http://www.bostonbrt.org/contact"">here</a>.</p>

<p>We’re optimistic that by taking such steps, municipalities can lead the way when it comes to reimagining our city streets.  Improving mobility in the Commonwealth will require bold work happening at multiple levels, and local leaders can take steps now to design our streets so they work for the 21st Century.</p>

276,Resilient Resolutions,<p>Key findings and next steps from a new report on Boston’s vulnerabilities to rising seas and other adverse climate effects.</p>,"<p>Last month <a href=""https://www.boston.gov/environment-and-energy/climate-ready-boston"">Climate Ready Boston released a new report</a>—a year in the making—that greatly improves knowledge regarding the expected impacts of climate change and the people and places in the city of Boston who will be most vulnerable. Marking the end of the first phase of Climate Ready Boston, an initiative led by the City of Boston in partnership with the Green Ribbon Commission, and supported by Barr, this report provides both the technical foundation and an implementation framework for long-term climate preparedness.  Among the report’s key findings are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>We will experience more intense rainfall and more extremes of heat.</strong><br>
These changes are already underway; “cloudbursts” (sudden, heavy rainstorms) will expose more than 11,000 structures and 85,000 people to frequent storm water flooding by about 2070.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Boston will experience sea-level rise greater than the global average, as a result of a unique set of geographic and oceanographic factors.</strong><br>
Because of the inertia already built into the ocean system, seven inches to 1.5 feet of sea-level rise are likely between now and 2050 irrespective of the trend in the global emissions of greenhouse gases. At least three feet of sea-level rise is likely sometime after 2070—with considerably more possible if the world does not get serious about reducing emissions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The frequency of flooding events will increase over time.</strong><br>
As the level of water in Boston Harbor rises, flooding along the waterfront that now has a 1% chance of occurring in any given year will increase to 10% after mid-century, and it will occur on a monthly basis—or even more often—by the end of the century. There is not yet any evidence that the intensity or frequency of hurricanes has changed, however.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Some of Boston’s fastest-growing neighborhoods are also its most vulnerable.</strong><br>
Several waterfront neighborhoods will be especially vulnerable to flooding associated with sea-level rise in the near term, including Downtown, East Boston, Charlestown, and the Seaport area of South Boston. Over the longer term, parts of Dorchester and the South End become increasingly vulnerable as flood waters penetrate inland via the Fort Point Channel and other locations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Flooding events will cause significant economic losses.</strong><br>
Sea-level rise will expose 18,000 people and $20 billion of real estate to flooding by about 2030—just 13 years away. Some 85,000 people and $85 billion of property will be exposed by about 2070—based only on what already exists today and not counting future growth and development. Annualized losses from physical damage, displacement, and business interruption are projected to exceed $1 billion by about 2070, unless corrective action is taken.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>With this technical foundation now in place, the Climate Ready Boston report outlines a series of implementation actions planned for the next five years. Summarized in a <a href=""https://www.boston.gov/sites/default/files/20161207_outlineofactionsroadmap_digital_final.pdf"">“Recommended Roadmap,”</a> the key strategies include: </p>

<ul>
<li>an initiative to expand education and engagement of Bostonians about the climate hazards the city will face in the decades ahead; </li>
<li>more detailed resiliency planning in vulnerable neighborhoods, including those proposed for new growth in one of the City’s other major planning efforts, <a href=""http://imagine.boston.gov"">Imagine Boston 2030</a>; </li>
<li>development of new regulatory tools to promote best practices in the siting and design of new development; and </li>
<li>an assessment of inner-harbor coastal protection measures that can defend parts of the city most vulnerable to flooding in the near term, such as in East Boston and Charlestown.</li>
</ul>

<p>Having supported Climate Ready Boston’s Phase I through its <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/climate/climate-preparedness"">Special Initiative for Climate Preparedness</a>, Barr is also providing significant funding to advance these four strategies. In December 2016, our trustees approved a $500,000 grant to the City of Boston with a pledge to match funding from other sources on a 2:1 basis, up to an additional $400,000 from Barr. The Foundation is also supporting the <a href=""https://www.umb.edu/ssl"">UMass Boston Sustainable Solutions Lab</a> to explore creative solutions for financing resilience measures, identify needs for new governance measures, and study the feasibility of outer-harbor protection systems that may be needed toward the second half of the century—all of which will support the implementation strategies of Climate Ready Boston.</p>

<p>We now know considerably more about the risks our city will face from climate change.  Fortunately, we also know that those risks can be reduced through prudent action. </p>

274,Six New England Artists Earn National Recognition,<p>Barr joins funders supporting exemplary artists to take risks and create new work.</p>,"<p>Last month, <a href=""http://www.unitedstatesartists.org/fellows/?tag=2016"">46 artists</a> were recognized as some of America’s most accomplished and innovative. <a href=""http://www.unitedstatesartists.org"">United States Artists, Inc. (USA)</a> annually awards artists, ranging in creative disciplines, with nationally competitive fellowships that grant $50,000 in unrestricted support.  The USA Fellowship was created in 2006 by the Ford, Rockefeller, Rasmuson, and Prudential foundations to address the lack of unrestricted funding for individual artists and has since distributed nearly $25 million in support of more than 450 artists.  This year, Barr joined a growing collection of funders sponsoring the award, and early this month we celebrated the inaugural class of USA Barr Fellows: six innovative, accomplished artists based in New England.</p>

<p>From Massachusetts is Janet Echelman, whose aerial sculpture “As If It Were Already Here” (featured above) was suspended over Boston’s Rose Kennedy Greenway for much of 2015. Crafts and visual artists include Laura Fensterstock and Anna Hepler from Maine, Roberto Lugo from Vermont, and Winfred Rembert from Connecticut. Choreographer Steve Paxton in Vermont is recognized as the leading pioneer of contact improvisation. Read more about these artists in the short bios below (and click their photos to see sample imagery of their work and their full bios at the USA website).</p>

<p>Receiving a USA grant can be a milestone achievement in an artist’s career. These funds can enable them to take new steps in their work and artistic risks with new materials, equipment, collaborators, or travel. Artists can direct their fellowship funds where most needed, such as purchasing equipment and materials, paying for health insurance, or taking time off from their “day jobs” to focus on art making. Some artists have used their awards to give grants to emerging artists.</p>

<p>But the rewards are more than just financial. As USA Fellows, they join a diverse and extraordinary network of top artists who range in age from 26 to 81, hail from 48 states and Puerto Rico, and are diverse in race, religion, gender, and sexual orientation. At the annual Artists Assembly, the year’s Fellows network, share ideas, and attend forums on vital professional and creative issues facing artists.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--pleased""> <p>is</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Barr is pleased to support artists as innovators and risk-takers who infuse beauty, connect communities, and provoke new understanding to societal challenges. Support of the USA Fellows builds on our commitment to elevate local and regional artists to new audiences throughout and beyond New England. This grant to USA follows Barr’s recent contributions to <a href=""http://www.tbf.org/investing-in-non-profits/funding-opportunities/other-support/live-arts-boston"">The Boston Foundation’s Live Arts Boston fund</a>, supporting local and individual artists in Boston, and the <a href=""http://www.nefa.org/grants_programs/programs/creative-city"">Creative City program at the New England Foundation for the Arts</a>, which aids artists in creating temporary public art projects and social interventions (<a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/creative-city-artists-are-activating-their-communities"">like this one we featured on our blog in July</a>).  Barr also funded <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/when-artists-are-at-the-intersection-of-planning-and-community"">local artists to actively participate</a> in the City of Boston’s cultural planning process, infusing it with creativity and exemplifying the unique skills artists bring to the table.</p>

<p>We look forward to following the USA Barr Fellows and watching the impacts on their work and careers of this additional capacity to pause, reflect, innovate, and create. In 2017, we plan to convene the Fellows in Boston so that they can present about their artistic process to the broader community.

270,Four Lessons of Climate Leadership from Northern Europe,"<p>Boston Green Ribbon Commission Director Amy Longsworth shares key insights from a recent trip by Massachusetts leaders to learn from cities that are enhancing quality of life, building resilience to climate change, and boosting their economies through clean energy.</p>","<p>Last June, the <a href=""http://www.greenribboncommission.org"">Boston Green Ribbon Commission (GRC)</a> organized a tour for a group of Boston business and civic leaders to Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Copenhagen.  Our goal was to learn about the strategies that these cities are pursuing as they cope with rising seas and other climate change vulnerabilities, while also managing growth and reducing carbon emissions—the same mix of challenges and goals we have in Boston. A grant from the Barr Foundation supported the trip. </p>

<p>We invited 24 leaders from Boston with an eagerness to learn and apply their insights.  Our group included City and State agency chiefs and senior staff in environment, energy, planning, and resilience; Boston City Council members; Massachusetts legislators; academic and NGO experts; business leaders; and philanthropy professionals. Full details of our trip and an excellent synthesis of major insights from the trip are <a href=""http://www.greenribboncommission.org/work/climate-innovations-study-tour/"">documented</a> on the GRC website.  Here are four of the biggest lessons (and four pictures) I took away from the trip:</p>
<h3>Lesson #1: Cities can change and adapt to become carbon neutral and climate resilient.</h3>
<p>Northern Europe is generally more prepared than the United States to respond to the water and energy management challenges posed by a changing climate.  While the reasons for action and leadership were largely rooted in crises—a devastating flood in the Netherlands in 1953 and the oil emergency in Denmark in 1973—responsive action stimulated the creation of new planning, governance, financing approaches, and technologies that are now proving useful in addressing climate change.  Boston, which has the advantage of foresight thanks to the <a href=""http://climateready.boston.gov"">Climate Ready Boston</a> initiative and other science-based climate impact analyses, has the opportunity to act now and to protect our city before it is too late.  Amsterdam and Copenhagen prove it’s possible.</p>
<h3>Lesson #2: Change requires new capacity for governance, financing, and regulations.</h3>
<p>For centuries the Dutch have managed water in their low-lying, wet country.  Approximately 60% of the GDP is produced below sea level. Canals, dikes, water catchment areas, levees, and several massive storm barriers lace the country. </p>

<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1417/small.jpg?1642119551 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1417/medium.jpg?1642119551 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1417/large.jpg?1642119551 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1417/x_large.jpg?1642119551 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""Amsterdam canals"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1417/small.jpg?1642119551"" /> </div> <div class=""Media-caption""> <p>Amsterdam</p> </div> </div></p>

<p>To sustain, protect, and promote this complex and vital activity required that the Dutch establish and continue to develop their capacity for governing, regulating, and financing water infrastructure. Water is governed at every level, from the local Water Boards, responsible for managing drinking water, sewage, and rain water, to the national Delta Programme, responsible for investing some $1 billion annually to maintain flood infrastructure, like the massive Maeslant Barrier floodgates that keep the nation safe from major floods and storms.</p>
<h3>Lesson #3: The transition to clean energy brings multiple benefits, including economic stimulus.</h3>
<p>Copenhagen aims to be carbon neutral by 2025, and the city is cranking on all fronts: transportation, electricity production, efficiency, and heating and cooling.  Along with slashing its carbon use, Denmark wants to be energy-diverse and energy-independent, as a matter of national security.  At the same time, it aims for 100% renewable electricity by 2035 and 100% renewable energy in all sectors by 2050. </p>

<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1425/small.jpg?1642119578 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1425/medium.jpg?1642119578 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1425/large.jpg?1642119578 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1425/x_large.jpg?1642119578 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""GRC"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1425/small.jpg?1642119578"" /> </div> <div class=""Media-caption""> <p>Energy</p> </div> </div></p>

<p>So far, the strategy has worked so well that since 2000, the Danish economy has soared while the national energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions have remained flat. Not only that, but Denmark, with a population equivalent to that of Wisconsin or Minnesota, exported roughly $10 billion in energy technology in 2015 (up from $4 billion in 2000), the highest among European nations.</p>

<h3>Lesson #4: The rallying cry is better quality of life (not climate).</h3>
<p>In their communication with residents and visitors, Copenhagen, Amsterdam, and Rotterdam leaders advance smart climate actions by emphasizing the opportunities to improve quality of life in the city. To back it up, they make sure that every investment in climate resilience or mitigation also has a public benefit that touches residents’ daily lives. Expanding green spaces in Amsterdam helps manage cloudbursts (intense, time-limited rainstorms) and also brings more nature into the city.  Attractively designed catchment areas in Rotterdam collect runoff and double as basketball courts and performance spaces. </p>

<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1414/small.jpg?1642119534 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1414/medium.jpg?1642119534 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1414/large.jpg?1642119534 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1414/x_large.jpg?1642119534 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""Bicycle COmmuters in Copenhagen"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1414/small.jpg?1642119534"" /> </div> <div class=""Media-caption""> <p>Commuters</p> </div> </div></p>

<p>When it snows in Copenhagen, bike lanes are plowed first, then sidewalks, and last streets.  While such investments may be driven by the need to manage for a changing climate, these cities market themselves on “the world’s best city for cyclists” and “more nature in the city”—and they revel in their growing reputation as great places to visit and live.</p>

269,King Tides Preview Rising Seas,<p>Boston’s recent “King Tides” provided a glimpse into the near-future—what scientists predict will be the “new normal” of daily high tides by mid-century.</p>,"<p>It is one thing to see flood maps projecting how Boston and other coastal cities will be affected over the next century. It is quite another thing to experience firsthand what that will actually look like—something the recent “King Tides” gave me an opportunity to do.</p>

<p>Over the last few months, Boston has experienced several instances of King Tides. This phenomenon occurs when the moon is closest to the Earth at the same time as the Earth is at its closest point in the orbit around the sun. While the extreme high and low tides, compared to normal levels, have been a feature of King Tides since the dawn of time, as “normal” levels have increased—already by roughly 10 inches over the last century—today’s King Tides offer a helpful preview of things to come.</p>

<p>The King Tides we experienced in the past month were the highest Boston has seen since the 1940s. Yet, according to the most recent scientific projections, Boston can expect to see tides reaching these levels as frequently as a few times per month by roughly 2040, and as often as every day by around 2060.</p>

<p>Last week, I took a short walk from our office to nearby Long Wharf to see what what’s in store for us within the next 25 to 35 years. Here are some of the images:</p>

<p>Fortunately, the City of Boston is taking this reality seriously. Through the <a href=""http://climateready.boston.gov"">Climate Ready Boston</a> initiative, a partnership between the City of Boston and the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/partners/green-ribbon-commission"">Green Ribbon Commission</a>, and supported by the Barr Foundation, we now have a clear view as to the expected climate impacts in the Boston region.</p>

<p>With this basis, Climate Ready Boston is developing a road map to address the significant vulnerabilities in our region. And the recently released (last Thursday) <a href=""http://20222-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Ib2030-Vision-Report-WEB-2016-11-17-SPREADS.pdf"">draft of Imagine Boston 2030</a>, the City’s first master planning effort in 50 years, underscores the importance of proactive climate planning and investment to address the challenges before us. In the next few weeks, Climate Ready Boston will release a separate report that outlines in greater detail the vulnerabilities and the opportunities before us. And soon after that report is released by the City of Boston, our colleague Bud Ris, who has been closely engaged with that effort from the beginning, will share a blog post to explain the key insights and recommendations. Stay tuned for that.</p>

<p>In the U.S. Northeast, it is sometimes easy to dismiss the impacts of climate change as too distant in the future to demand action. But the benefit of the King Tides these past few weeks is to make tangible and real what will become the new normal for Greater Boston. We cannot escape what nature will bring, but we can plan in a responsible and future-oriented way to ensure that Boston is prepared. Taking such a long-term view is at the core of the Barr Foundation’s work, and we welcome the opportunity to engage with like-minded partners to ensure that Boston embraces the imperative to be climate resilient.</p>"
268,Frame Shift. Then Power Shift.,"<p>Elena Letona, executive director of Neighbor to Neighbor (and a 2005 Barr Fellow), shares lessons learned from an old, industrial city in western Massachusetts, where community members, labor groups, elected officials, and others found common cause in a winning effort to go from “coal to sol!”</p>","<p>As I write this, a brave struggle rages in Standing Rock. First Nations have joined to stop the construction of an oil pipeline. Their war cry is not “reduce carbon emissions.”</p>

<p>Their war cry is respect for the sanctity of water, land, and life itself.</p>

<p>This is a different frame. Yet, if victorious, this fight will contribute to reducing carbon emissions, the leading cause of climate change.</p>

<p>In Holyoke, Massachusetts, a low-income, majority-Latino town went from coal to solar.</p>

<p>Their fight was not framed in terms of climate action either. Yet in the end, it also reduced carbon emissions.</p>

<p>The story begins in 2010, when the <a href=""http://www.sierraclub.org/massachusetts"">Sierra Club</a> invited economic justice organization <a href=""http://www.n2nma.org/en"">Neighbor to Neighbor (N2N)</a> to join a campaign to shut down Holyoke’s Mt. Tom Coal Plant. </p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--was""> <p>fight</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>For an organization that organized people based on bread and butter issues, shutting down coal did not resonate at first. However, as N2N members learned of the connection between contamination and health problems, they became outraged that their health should be put at risk by a multi-national energy giant.</p>

<p>The organization joined together with <a href=""http://www.toxicsaction.org"">Toxics Action Center</a>, <a href=""http://www.clf.org"">Conservation Law Foundation</a>, and the Sierra Club to put forward a vision that resonated with the community: We want clean air so our kids can breathe without inhalers, clean land and water so we can safely eat the food we grow and fish we catch, and responsible business that brings good, clean jobs to Holyoke.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1392/small.jpg?1642119484 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1392/medium.jpg?1642119484 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1392/large.jpg?1642119484 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1392/x_large.jpg?1642119484 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""Neighbor to Neighbor"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1392/small.jpg?1642119484"" /> <div class=""FancyAttribution""> <p><a class=""FancyAttribution-link"" href=""http://www.n2nma.org/en/"">Neighbor to Neighbor</a></p> </div> </div> </div></p>

<p>But even with this growing coalition, an important voice in this community was still missing. Many N2N leaders had lost their jobs when factories closed and were worried about the plant workers. So they invited unions to join the coalition and added a demand for a just transition: to care for the laid-off coal plant workers.</p>

<p>N2N brought this message door-to-door and held press conferences and forums to build support. With support from so many, including the unions, an inclusive and just message, and in-the-streets tenacity, in the end, all shared the victory.</p>

<p>By 2011, public officials funded and launched a study to determine the best future use for the coal plant site.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2015, the Mt. Tom coal plant shut down. </p>

<p>Just one year later, plant owners agreed to meet the worker’s demands for severance and retirement packages. And several months later, the company broke ground on a solar field and committed to cleaning up and removing the contaminated chimney.</p>

<p>We glean two major lessons from this story:</p>
<h3>1. It takes all of us.</h3>
<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1394/small.jpg?1642119487 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1394/medium.jpg?1642119487 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1394/large.jpg?1642119487 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1394/x_large.jpg?1642119487 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""Toxics Action Center"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/1394/small.jpg?1642119487"" /> <div class=""FancyAttribution""> <p><a class=""FancyAttribution-link"" href=""http://www.toxicsaction.org/"">Toxics Action Center</a></p> </div> </div> </div></p>

<p>When we bridge divides, and environmental groups band together with directly affected community members and labor groups, elected officials, and philanthropic supporters, we have the elements for a complex, victorious campaign.</p>
<h3>2. Our message must resonate deeply and broadly.</h3>
<p>Working-class, Latino N2N members were not ready to join a fight to shut down a coal plant. However, they were ready to fight for their health, land, water, and good jobs. We must shift the frame and our collective understanding of the profound damage that a fossil-fueled economy does to people and planet.</p>

<p>More than ever, in the face of the divisive 2016 presidential election, we must come together and ground our work in values that embrace our care-taking of each other and our only home: Earth.</p>

267,Barr Seeks Proposals from Innovative Schools and Programs,<p>Foundation issues RFP for planning and design of schools and programs in New England focused on connecting students off track to graduation to success in high school and beyond.</p>,"<p>In September, <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/barr-launches-new-initiative-to-support-off-track-youth"">I announced</a> a new multi-year initiative from Barr’s Education Program. Our goal is to marshal critical resources, awareness, solutions, and opportunities to support one of New England’s most marginalized high school populations: students who are off track in the goal of graduating from high school and connecting to post-secondary success. Our first step was to issue an RFI to identify, learn from, and begin to engage with potential partners.</p>

<p>In the weeks that followed, we received 128 RFI responses from people coming at this challenge from many different angles—individual schools (including district, charter, and independent schools), whole districts, community-based organizations, intermediaries, universities, and entrepreneurs. Responses were submitted from throughout New England and beyond. While there was a great variety in perspectives and approaches to opening pathways for young people, all of the proposals shared a singular commitment to student success. Our deepest thanks goes to all who invested time to share their expertise and aspirations with us. Your input was an inspiration to us, and enormously helpful, as we worked to clarify the types of partners we are looking for.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--128""> <p>received</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>We have several key takeaways from the RFI responses. First and foremost, it is evident that there is tremendous interest in improving the life trajectories of New England high school students who are off track to graduate. RFI responses also made it clear that there are a variety of means to address the needs of this population, including implementation of school and program models and targeted student interventions. While all of these approaches are important to the ecosystem of improving outcomes for students who are not connecting to success in high school, for the purposes of this initiative, we are honing in on the approach of full-time, holistic schools and programs. Within this approach of school and program models, it is clear that there is a range of governance structures that may be valuable to advancing high-quality pathways to a public high school diploma.</p>

<p>A final key takeaway is that RFI respondents were interested in creating new schools/programs, expanding existing options, and improving existing sites, all of which are important methods to increase the quantity and quality of high-quality schools and programs for New England’s students who are off track for graduation.</p>

<p>Today, we are excited to embark on the next phase of this work—and to release a <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/education/rfp#rfp"">request for proposals (RFP)</a> that builds on what we learned during the RFI phase. The Barr Foundation seeks proposals for innovative public high schools and programs across New England that are designed to support students who are not on track to graduate or connect to post-secondary success by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Creating intentionally flexible and responsive environments that integrate Positive Youth Development Theory.</li>
<li>Leveraging assets in their surrounding communities.</li>
<li>Drawing on diverse networks to access critical resources for students.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our goal is to support the development of exemplary schools and programs across the region that can powerfully demonstrate the impact of intentionally addressing both academic and developmental needs with student-centered, targeted, and supportive approaches.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--that""> <p>believe</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Funding in this initiative will roll out in two phases. The first phase, which this RFP addresses, is for planning. Starting today, applicants can begin preparing their proposals for one-year planning grants of up to $150,000 each to support the development of their school or program. Barr will accept proposals via an <a href=""https://www.tfaforms.com/forms/view/456203/"">online form</a> until February 15, 2017.</p>

<p>We expect to announce a first cohort of as many as eight planning grants in July 2017. We also plan for this to be the first of three annual cohorts of planning grantees. Each year, in addition to financial support, awardees will receive technical assistance and will have access to collective learning opportunities facilitated by our nonprofit partner <a href=""http://www.springpointschools.org"">Springpoint</a>.</p>

<p>Following the planning year, Barr will invite a subset of planning grant awardees to apply for two-year implementation grants of up to $750,000 each. We anticipate that successful applicants in the implementation phase will then launch their expanded, improved, or new models in the fall of 2018. </p>

<p>We believe that all students have the right, and the ability, to connect to secondary and post-secondary success. In order to fully realize their potential, even students who are not currently on track to graduate can and must be supported to achieve at high levels. Doing so requires targeted investments in new models that embrace a student-centered approach. We are excited to be able to offer this funding opportunity and look forward to partnering with leaders in this work. </p>

266,The Promise of Integrated Water Transportation in Boston,"<p>On November 3, the Boston City Council’s Committee on Parks, Recreation, & Transportation held a hearing on water transportation in Boston Harbor. Jim Canales was invited to testify. Following are his remarks.</p>","<p>Good afternoon. My name is Jim Canales, and I serve as president and trustee of the Barr Foundation.  I am grateful for the opportunity to share my perspective about water transportation, from the vantage point of a philanthropic organization committed to issues of mobility, climate resilience, and a great public realm along Boston’s waterfront.</p>

<p>As this hearing attests, there is tremendous interest in the waterfront right now. With respect to water transportation, there is also some good coordination that has already begun, and the range of interested parties represented today speaks well for the opportunities for collaboration to be productive. Barr is delighted to be part of this effort, and I’d like to thank City Councilors Sal LaMattina and Bill Linehan for calling today’s hearing and offering all of us the opportunity to share our perspectives and ideas.</p>

<p>Let me begin with brief background on the Barr Foundation: We are a philanthropic foundation based in Boston that will grant approximately $73 million in 2016 across the region to advance our mission of investing in human, natural, and creative potential. We were formed in the late 1990s and focus our work in three principal areas: <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/arts-creativity"">Arts and Creativity</a>; <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/climate"">Climate</a>; and <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/education"">Education</a>.</p>

<p>Relevant to this conversation today, within our Climate program, one of our two principal priorities is <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/climate/mobility"">mobility</a>, where our emphasis is on what we call “smarter travel and smarter places.”</p>

<p>A key piece of what we mean by “smarter” is travel that it is holistic and integrated; that is, mobility that provides multiple options for people to get around the city and region better, to ease congestion, to better connect communities, and to give people more choices. We also care about continuing reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by finding alternatives to getting in a car as the best way for people to get where they need to go. Given the geography of Greater Boston—defined in so many ways by its waterfronts—and increasing density along the waterfront in Boston, you can easily see how water transportation fits in that bigger vision.</p>

<p><strong>Barr Foundation’s Waterfront Initiative</strong></p>

<p>In addition to Barr’s focus on mobility, we recently launched a <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/stewarding-a-boston-treasure"">special initiative on Boston’s waterfront</a>. As a foundation, we are in unique position to take a long-term view and, we hope, be a constructive partner to others who share similar aspirations and beliefs in what is possible.</p>

<p>Our interest in the future of Boston’s waterfront emanates from a recognition that Boston’s Harbor and waterfront are treasures, and vital public assets that deserves thoughtful stewardship. The goal of Barr’s waterfront investments is to ensure the realization of a great public realm throughout Boston’s waterfront—one that embraces climate resiliency, ensures accessibility and inclusiveness, promotes open space, advances mobility, and demonstrates great design. In this context, what interests us about water transportation is not merely an affinity for boats, but the potential that an efficient and comprehensive water transportation system could serve a broader set of goals and vision for Boston’s waterfront.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--us""> <p>interests</p> </blockquote></p>

<p><strong>Context for Water Transportation Today</strong></p>

<p>So, in our view, this is the right time for this conversation about water transportation. It is occurring in the context of <a href=""http://imagine.boston.gov/"">larger visioning and planning for the future of Boston</a>, and we have been encouraged by the efforts of City and State leaders to be aspirational in their approach to mobility and public realm planning.</p>

<p>The opportunity here is not merely to explore the possibility of creating a ferry system, but to consider how we might reimagine our waterways in ways that serve a broader transportation vision to connect all neighborhoods.</p>

<p>In this context, the potential of a ferry system is compelling to us for two principal reasons: </p>

<p>First, such a system can be a catalyst for activating our imagination for the entire waterfront—how water transportation can connect to the rest of the City by foot and public transit and support a variety of public activities and interesting destination points along the waterfront. </p>

<p>And second, water transportation could play a critical role when considered in the context of a broader vision for transportation in the region. And this might also dovetail with other facets of Barr’s work, with the City, with the Green Ribbon Commission, and many others who are participating in the <em><a href=""http://goboston2030.org/en"">Go Boston 2030</a></em> effort to articulate a long-term vision for mobility in the region.</p>

<p><strong>Barr as a Constructive Partner</strong></p>

<p>So, let me now conclude by focusing on those ways where the Barr Foundation might be a constructive partner in this exploration. At this time, we see one of our principal roles as supporting rigorous analysis of some of the key questions before us.</p>

<p>While we are optimistic about the potential of water transportation and what it could bring to our city, we believe that a critical first step ought to be sound technical analysis to help address at least the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What might the prospective ridership be?</li>
<li>How could a more robust water transportation system connect with other transit modes, and what impact would it have on those other modes?</li>
<li>What would be a financially sustainable business model?</li>
<li>And, an important consideration for us at Barr given our focus on climate, how would a robust water transportation system both improve mobility and reduce greenhouse gases?</li>
</ul>

<p>Many of these questions will be explored through the Request for Information (RFI) that <a href=""http://www.bostonharbornow.org"">Boston Harbor Now</a> has already initiated. We are pleased to see how carefully thought out the RFI has been. We hope that process will remain open and transparent once the consultants are selected, to ensure maximum public buy-in, and to foster creative public-private partnerships, so we don’t have a lot of disparate organizations looking at this in disconnected ways.</p>

<p>As one model, Barr has been supportive of this same manner of holistic thinking and planning, and broad community engagement through the <em>Go Boston 2030</em> planning effort, which has established a goal that every household be no more than a 10-minute walk from public transit options. Imagine if water transportation were part of how the city reached that goal.</p>

<p>Yet another example, which may serve as parallel to this exploration of ferry service, is Bus Rapid Transit, or BRT. BRT is another promising solution that is working in leading global cities. Barr’s role in exploring the viability of bringing BRT to Boston has included the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>We funded <a href=""http://www.bostonbrt.org/the-brt-report"">an analysis</a> to explore whether BRT was technically feasible and where it would make the most sense. </li>
<li>We convened and supported leaders in transportation, as well as those from communities where we might try BRT in order to do outreach, to test interest, and improve the concept based on community input.</li>
<li>We sponsored <a href=""http://www.greenribboncommission.org/work/climate-innovations-study-tour"">learning tours</a> for community, civic, and government leaders to see how leading cities are implementing BRT, to be inspired by their example, and to import ideas that may work for us in Boston.</li>
<li>We are currently supporting active exploration with both the City and State regarding how to implement a pilot of <a href=""http://www.bostonbrt.org/the-gold-standard"">Gold Standard BRT</a> in Boston.</li>
</ul>

<p>We may not follow the same blueprint with water transportation, but the BRT example gives you a sense of the ways you might think of the Barr Foundation as a partner.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--well""> <p>done</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>So, to end where I began: I express our gratitude that you have called this conversation, and I want to be certain to convey our organization’s enthusiasm for the potential here. If done well, there’s no reason Boston can’t create a water transportation system on par with cities like New York, San Francisco, and Amsterdam—a system that, perhaps most importantly, connects to a broader vision, and that complements and seamlessly connects to our multi-modal transportation network and an expanding set of high-quality choices for how people get around our city.</p>

<p>Thank you for the invitation, and we look forward to staying engaged in this process.</p>

265,The Future of Electricity in the Northeast,<p>New report and video explore rapidly evolving clean energy opportunities and challenges facing the region.</p>,"<p>As recently as 2000, more than 40% of electricity in the U.S. Northeast came from coal and oil. Today, that number is closer to 15%. Successful efforts to phase out the dirtiest fuels, promote energy efficiency, and regulate carbon have put this region at the forefront of a global response to climate change.</p>

<p>To help make sense of this rapid, dramatic, and ongoing transformation, a new report and companion video—<a href=""http://www.mjbradley.com/sites/default/files/powerswitch10-19-2016.pdf""><em>Power Switch: The Future of the Electric Power System in the Northeast and the Disruptive Power of Innovation</em></a>—explore the trends that are reshaping our electric power markets, and the opportunities and challenges ahead. This independent analysis was conducted by M.J. Bradley &amp; Associates and funded by Barr, the Merck Family Fund, the Devonshire Foundation, and Daniel Hildreth.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--as""> <p>recently</p> </blockquote></p>

<p><em>Power Switch</em> credits the region’s significant successes to rapid advancements in technology, competitive electricity markets, low gas prices, smart policy choices, and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), which is the Northeast’s highly successful carbon trading program. As just a few examples of how much is changing, and how quickly in the Northeast, consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>The first-in-the-nation off-shore wind farm comes online this year in Block Island, Rhode Island.</li>
<li>The Booth Bay Smart Grid Reliability Project is piloting a combination of solar and storage technologies to manage seasonal peak demand in Maine without any new transmission lines. </li>
<li>Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island are conducting a joint solicitation to attract construction of new clean energy sources.</li>
<li>These same three states, along with New York and Maryland, continue to set new, ambitious clean energy standards and carbon reduction targets for 2030.</li>
</ul>

<p>Together, efforts like these have helped spur a major shift to cleaner energy, while also growing the regional economy (at roughly 8% over the past decade). However, to achieve ambitious, long-term carbon reduction goals (with most Northeast states aiming for an 80% reduction by 2050), we need to really pick up the pace. <em>Power Switch</em> asserts that these goals are indeed attainable and will require four complementary strategies:</p>

<ol>
<li>Continued investments in new, smarter technologies and energy efficiency.</li>
<li>Strong energy and climate policies that provide clear, long-term market signals and that drive investments in the region’s clean energy future.</li>
<li>Continue de-carbonization of electricity production and supply with substantial increases in cleaner electricity and scaling up renewables.</li>
<li>Expansion beyond electricity to other sectors that are highly dependent on fossils fuels—such as transportation and heating—and support of their transition to new sources of clean electricity.</li>
</ol>

<p>The accompanying video (embedded below) provides compelling testimonials from notable energy experts, including Sue Tierney (Analysis Group), Peter Kelly-Detwiler (Northbridge Energy Partners), Gordon van Welie (ISO New England), and Kelly Speakes-Backman (Alliance to Save Energy). They discuss how clear and consistent policy signals and technology innovation can change the electric markets through 2030 and beyond. Kelly-Detwiler, in a recent <a href=""https://www.greenbiz.com/article/last-mile-clean-energy-northeast"">Green Biz article</a>, underscores this point, saying, “these signals will drive the innovation we need, from battery storage to electric vehicles to energy efficiency improvements and help our society continue to build out the new energy economy.” In the video, Speakes-Backman reminds us that policy-makers also play a critically important role in ensuring that all populations have access to innovations and benefits that arise from this market transformation.</p>

264,A Vital Piece of Our Clean Energy Future Ready for Primetime: Energy Storage ,"<p>New report reveals the potential for energy storage to save people in Massachusetts millions in energy costs, reduce emissions, and accelerate the success of local, clean energy. </p>","<p>Last month the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources (DOER) and the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center released <em><a href=""http://www.mass.gov/eea/docs/doer/state-of-charge-report.pdf"">State of Charge</a></em>, a much-anticipated report on energy storage.  The report is part of the Commonwealth’s $10-million <a href=""http://www.mass.gov/eea/energy-utilities-clean-tech/renewable-energy/energy-storage-initiative/"">Energy Storage Initiative</a> announced last year, and offers both in-depth analysis of the state’s storage potential and concrete recommendations for how to capture it.  The headline finding is that energy storage represents an enormous opportunity for Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Why is energy storage such a big deal?  Storage has the potential to dramatically change our electricity landscape because today only a tiny portion of electricity produced can be stored for future usage—the DOER report estimates only 1%, compared to a typical 10% of storage for other important resources like food.  This lack of electric storage has many impacts—one is that we build and maintain expensive and dirty plants to meet peak demand for power on the hottest days in the summer and the coldest days in the winter.  It also means that when we don’t need all of the power plants on our regional electric grid, even the cleanest ones must ramp down production.  Energy storage enables cheaper, cleaner energy to power our grid when demand is the highest, not just when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing. </p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--enables""> <p>storage</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>The State of Charge study finds that energy storage produces economic benefits associated with reducing peak electric demand, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, deferring expensive transmission and generation projects, and increasing grid flexibility, reliability, and resiliency.  If its recommendations are implemented, the state will be on the leading edge of storage deployment. </p>

<p>The DOER report also shows that storage can deliver tremendous savings for ratepayers because it will help to reduce costs when demand peaks, making our grid more efficient.  The Massachusetts report estimates that deploying 600 MW (megawatts) of energy storage in the state by 2025 will capture $800 million in benefits for Massachusetts ratepayers. </p>

<p>So why don’t we have more storage on our grid today?  Several factors contribute to this, but one the report focuses on is the lack of mechanisms to monetize the value of storage.  Although storage can behave like a source of energy, a storage owner can’t get paid like someone who owns a generating plant (at least not yet in Massachusetts, though this is becoming increasingly common in other parts of the world).  That’s why the report’s recommendations include exploring ways to compensate those who could provide energy back to the grid from storage, just as we compensate other suppliers of energy.  Solving this challenge would encourage developers to ramp up the number of storage installations and make combined projects such as solar and storage more cost effective. </p>

<p>Another factor slowing the growth of storage is a mistaken view that storage is a new technology not yet “ready for primetime”—when in fact it is commercially viable, and it is also easier to site than many other energy sources.  That’s why Barr is funding the Clean Energy Group’s <a href=""http://www.cleanegroup.org/ceg-projects/resilient-power-project"">Resilient Power Project</a>, which is supporting Massachusetts communities that want to pilot storage projects, showcasing how storage can be partnered with renewables like solar to provide a range of benefits including resiliency and preparedness.  The town of Sterling, for example, recently broke ground on its 2 MW “Community Clean Energy Resiliency Initiative Battery Storage Project.”  When the project begins operation later this year, it will use storage to support critical services at the police station and dispatch center during power outages.  When the power is on, the town’s municipal electric department will get paid for the valuable services provided by the storage project.  This is one of many projects spurred by the state’s Community Clean Energy Resiliency Initiative, which will provide $40 million for community-based projects to show that storage is viable and ready for deployment. </p>

<p>The state’s impressive <em>State of Charge</em> report reflects nearly a year of research and economic analysis by the agencies and lays out their policy and programmatic road map to achieve the state’s potential for energy storage.  Now the next phase of work begins, as clean energy businesses, municipalities, and other stakeholders such as Clean Energy Group work together to help realize the economic and environmental benefits of this important tool in the clean energy toolkit.</p>

263,What do Artists and Creative Workers in New England need to Thrive Here?,<p>New England Foundation for the Arts’ director of research introduces “Creatives Count”—a new survey of area creatives to bring more resources and attention to their sector.</p>,"<p>Creative workers are a vital part of our region’s vibrancy. Yet they are often undercounted and, as a result, their creative work is not as well-supported as it might be. This is due in part to the fluid nature of their work lives, but also, even in this era of big data, to a significant knowledge gap about the size and diversity of our region’s population of artists and creative workers, and about the opportunities and challenges they face in producing creative work here. In an unprecedented effort to change that, and to hear directly from as many of New England’s artists and creative workers as possible, the New England Foundation for the Arts (NEFA), the state arts agencies from the six New England states, and the Barr Foundation have launched a new survey called <a href=""http://www.nefa.org/creativescount"">Creatives Count</a>, which is open now until November 18.</p>

<p>This survey is designed to collect work-related data that will help fill this knowledge gap. Artists and creative workers of all kinds are encouraged to take the survey online in English, Chinese, or Spanish, and to encourage colleagues to do so, as well. For the purposes of this survey, <strong>we define “creative workers” as visual artists, dancers, musicians, theater-makers, designers, craftspeople, architects, digital media creators, culture bearers, writers, and more</strong>.</p>

<p>The survey does take some time to fill out—roughly 30 minutes. Yet the work and lives of creative workers are complicated and complex. And only by knowing who they are, where they are, and what they need, can those of us who advocate for better policies, or who plan, support, and lead programs to help and advance their creative work—only then can we be as effective as we need to be.</p>

<p>All responses will be kept confidential and will be reported only in the aggregate, so that no individuals can be identified. A <a href=""http://www.nefa.org/news/nefa-produce-creative-economy-report"">final report on the whole creative sector in New England</a> will be released in spring 2017, and all respondents will be notified and have the opportunity to download a copy at that time. Those who complete the survey will also have the option to have a profile created and populated with relevant detail on NEFA’s regional creative economy directory, <a href=""https://www.creativeground.org"">CreativeGround</a>—although artists and creative workers can also create their own profiles on CreativeGround at any time. The website, which is unique to our region, is a free online community that spotlights and connects the rich range of creative people and places at work in the six New England states. Additionally, everyone who completes a survey will automatically be entered into a drawing to win one of 12 gift cards.</p>

<p>NEFA, together with our partners at the New England state arts agencies (Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development, Maine Arts Commission, Massachusetts Cultural Council, New Hampshire State Council on the Arts, Rhode Island State Council on the Arts, and the Vermont Arts Council), the Barr Foundation, and advocates for creative workers around the region thank everyone who responds for their input, and we look forward to sharing the report in the spring.</p>

262,Successes in Philanthropy: Activating Civic Leadership,<p>How Boston’s Green Ribbon Commission is helping the city meet ambitious goals to fight climate change.</p>,"<p><em>This article originally appeared as part of the Washington Monthly&#39;s <a href=""http://philanthropy.washingtonmonthly.com/portfolio_page/activating-civic-leadership"">“Successes in Philanthropy” series</a>.</em></p>

<p>In the fall of 2015, the Boston Medical Center announced its plan to become the city’s “greenest” hospital. As the <a href=""https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/09/17/boston-medical-center-aims-become-city-greenest-hospital/Y5NddLyiQjm7pJfJblvrQN/story.html""><em>Boston Globe</em> reported</a>, the hospital set aggressive goals for reducing its emissions by investing in energy efficiency, while also improving its bottom line. Today, Boston Medical, which is New England’s largest trauma center focused on caring for the city’s most vulnerable populations, has put itself on a path to reduce emissions at least 50 percent by 2018 and to reduce its average annual energy costs by $8 million to 11 million dollars. “Every dollar spent on energy is a dollar not spent on our mission,” Bob Biggio, the hospital’s vice president of facilities and support services told the Globe. “It is really helping us fulfill our mission.”</p>

<p>Boston Medical’s effort, while ambitious, is not unique. In fact, the hospital is one of 20 Boston-area hospitals and health systems that are working together to reduce their carbon emissions and energy consumption as part of Boston’s “Green Ribbon Commission,” a groundbreaking effort created and supported by the Barr Foundation, the City of Boston, and other philanthropic partners to catalyze the fight against climate change on a broad scale.</p>

<p>Made up of Boston’s leading business, institutional, and civic leaders, the Commission was originally conceived as a watchdog group that would hold the City accountable for making progress on its Climate Action Plan. Yet, it quickly evolved into a center for action as well. Commission members have shown remarkable leadership in their own sectors to reduce emissions, by investing in energy efficiency and clean energy. And they have also become actively engaged in important policy debates related to energy, transportation, and climate resiliency.</p>

<p>As part of the <a href=""http://www.greenribboncommission.org"">Boston Green Ribbon Commission</a>’s Health Care Working Group, Boston Medical Center is on track to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50 percent by 2018.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--have""> <p>members</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Initially convened by one of Barr’s founding trustees and Boston’s former mayor, the Commission is now sustained by funding from seven local foundations—many of which (Barr included) also provide support for nonprofits that coordinate working groups on specific sectors, such as Health Care (coordinated by <a href=""http://www.noharm.org"">Health Care Without Harm</a>), or Commercial Real Estate (<a href=""http://www.abettercity.org"">A Better City</a>).</p>

<p>Strategies like these are effective because sometimes the most powerful tool in the philanthropy toolkit isn’t a grant.</p>

<p>Most of the challenges philanthropy seeks to address are bigger than any one foundation. And they are bigger than any collection of nonprofits we can support with our grantmaking. Climate change is a prime example. In 2010, the Barr Foundation joined a growing cadre of foundations that recognized climate change as a defining issue of our time, with the potential to overwhelm everything else we care about. At that point, Barr had been supporting a range of environmental work for over a decade, principally in Boston. With an initial five-year, $50 million pledge, we focused on the goal of helping Boston and Massachusetts meet or exceed their targets for driving down greenhouse gas emissions. Since then, Barr has expanded its geographic scope and recently launched a <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/clean-energy"">revised set of strategies</a> aimed at advancing solutions for clean energy, mobility, and resilient communities. In 2016 alone, we expect to make new grant commitments related to climate change in excess of $20 million.</p>

<p>Yet, even with this growth, and despite Barr now being among the nation’s largest funders of local and regional climate efforts, we know there is simply no way to succeed without engagement and leadership from other sectors, like business, government, health care, and academia. Each represent huge portions of our economy. And each has enormous potential to contribute to positive change.</p>

<p>But because grantmaking alone can’t solve a challenge as broad as climate change, the solution we often come to is the role of convener. In our climate program, playing this role led to the Boston Green Ribbon Commission, which has become highly influential in spurring climate action.</p>

<p>In addition to the Commission’s Health Care Working Group, of which Boston Medical is a part, other hospitals in this group are making impressive strides as well. From 2010–2015, Massachusetts General Hospital reduced its emissions 35 percent from a 2005 baseline. Moreover, Working Group members are exploring common challenges, effective practices, and lessons learned. And these efforts are drawing attention from and influencing practice at hospitals across the country. As Paul Lipke, a senior advisor for Health Care Without Harm, <a href=""http://dailyfreepress.com/2015/09/24/boston-medical-center-aims-to-be-green-lead-way-in-sustainability-efforts"">told the <em>Daily Free Press</em></a>: “The healthcare sector is on the front line of climate change. Hospitals are not only where people go for help in emergency situations, but they are also huge energy users, and they have sworn to do no harm. Through no fault of their own, they are part of a system that uses greenhouse gas energy to meet the needs of their patients and researchers. More than any other sector, they have a mission-related reason to [become more energy efficient]. Every penny they spend on energy is a penny they can’t spend on patients or prevention.”</p>

<p>Another effort organized by the Commission was a <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/big-returns-for-investing-in-renewable-energy"">Renewable Energy Leadership Prize</a>, designed to spur local institutions to pursue large scale renewable energy purchases. The Prize brought several of Boston’s major institutions to the table and attracted three applicants who devoted considerable time and effort to solving the puzzle of buying offsite renewable electricity. This is something they had already begun to work on, and The Prize helped push them on to the finish line. It also helped draw attention to these exciting, tangible examples of institutions and companies engaging in renewable energy purchases. If all three deals go ahead as planned, it could result in as much as 82 megawatts of new renewable energy capacity.</p>

<p>While I have focused here on the Green Ribbon Commission’s impact within the health care sector, and on pilot projects related to clean energy, the group has also been highly engaged in advancing Boston’s efforts related to climate preparedness (partnering with the City to lead its <a href=""http://climateready.boston.gov"">Climate Ready Boston</a> planning effort), in addition to planning to modernize the region’s transportation network via the <a href=""http://goboston2030.org/en"">Go Boston 2030</a> project.</p>

<p>At the Barr Foundation, our mission centers on a commitment to serve as both stewards and catalysts. As catalysts, we seek to play a role in cultivating and advancing new ideas and solutions that will shape our collective future. By convening a group of leaders, with a range of perspectives, resources, and networks to bring to bear on common challenges such as climate change, we can help to bring about the transformational change we need.</p>

260,Meet the Newest Member of Barr’s Climate Team,"<p>Eight questions with Lisa Jacobson, who recently joined Barr as Program Officer for Mobility.</p>","<h3>What first got you interested in mobility?</h3>
<p>Transportation is really interesting to me because it is a system that almost everyone relies on every day. There are so many intricacies working behind the scenes to make the system run and move people to where they need to go. These systems are fascinating to me. </p>
<h3>You are a big proponent of community engagement and input in transportation planning. Why is that so important?</h3>
<p>Most people don’t give much thought to the technical details of transportation. But everyone is an expert in their own experience—they walk, bike, drive, get a ride, and/or ride transit. Community members are the ones experiencing the system firsthand. And that is why community perspectives hold such value to technical experts.</p>
<h3>Are there times when engagement is unhelpful?</h3>
<p>I wouldn’t say unhelpful. But there are many aspects of transportation planning that are not intuitive—when what seems like the obvious solution can actually make things worse. One example is traffic. Often, the solution people advocate for to address congestion is to build more lanes on a road. But, if you actually look at the data, that doesn’t work. If there is free space, traffic might improve in the short term. But long term, that space gets filled in by even more traffic. The technical term for this is “induced demand.” It’s not unlike what happens when people loosens their belt buckles. It gives them more room to fill.</p>

<p>So, on the one hand, community engagement is a critical tool for transportation planners to understand how the public thinks. Yet, at its best, community engagement is a two-way conversation. With effective engagement, planners can also help community members understand the effects of certain planning decisions that are commonly misunderstood. </p>
<h3>What’s the most fun, creative community engagement tactic you’ve used? Was it effective? And why?</h3>
<p>When the city of Fayetteville, Arkansas, was undergoing a transportation planning process, a team of us used a popsicle tricycle to solicit community input. We traded popsicles for ideas and visited a wide range of places within the city, including senior citizen centers, little league baseball games, farmers’ markets, libraries, and popular restaurants. Instead of asking community members to attend a meeting in a location and time of our choice, we brought the meeting to them. I think this was effective because people appreciate being asked what they think, especially if you are willing to meet them where they are and really listen to their ideas.</p>

<h3>Are there other techniques you’ve heard about that you’ve always wanted to try?</h3>
<p>It’s very illuminating to show rather than tell how walkable communities or transportation systems could look in the future. I’ve participated in several “pop-up” projects in which temporary changes are made to the built environment, such as an added bike lane, intersection redesign, or parklet (<a href=""https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/08/30/pop-plaza-appears-downtown/yd6XQJOk4X9ssEtJMcQSIO/story.html"">see the Pop-up Plaza that recently appeared in Boston’s Downtown Crossing</a>). But often, because of certain regulations, capacity, or materials, these projects are limited in how long they can last. I would love to implement longer-term pilots in which we could evaluate behavior change and other effects resulting from pop-up infrastructure.</p>
<h3>The Mobility portfolio has two main strategies, which we summarize as “smarter travel” and “smarter places.”  Can you describe why smarter places is part of the Mobility strategy?</h3>
<p>We talk about better, more reliable transit service all the time. But the places that people connect to at the beginnings, middles, and ends of their trips are just as important as how they get to those places. Once you get off the bus or exit the train, what can you see, what can you do, where can you get to by foot? Having amenities throughout one’s trip and a pleasant walking environment reduces the need to get in a car and drive. And that gives people the option to live car-free (or “car-light”) if they want to. <span class=""InlineTweet""> <span class=""InlineTweet-content"">more</span> <a class=""InlineTweet-cta"" href=""https://twitter.com/intent/tweet/?dnt=true&amp;text=and""> <svg width=""48"" height=""48"" viewBox=""628 -718 2048 2048"" class=""Icon"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg""> <path d=""M2417.2-86.6c1.2,17,1.2,33.9,1.2,50.9c0,517.3-393.8,1113.4-1113.4,1113.4c-221.7,0-427.7-64.2-601-175.7 c31.5,3.6,61.8,4.8,94.5,4.8c183,0,351.4-61.8,485.8-167.2c-172-3.6-316.2-116.3-365.9-271.4c24.2,3.6,48.5,6.1,73.9,6.1 c35.1,0,70.3-4.8,103-13.3C916.1,424.7,781.6,267.2,781.6,76.9c0-1.2,0-3.6,0-4.8c52.1,29.1,112.7,47.2,176.9,49.7 C853.1,51.5,784-68.4,784-204.2c0-72.7,19.4-139.3,53.3-197.5C1030-164.2,1319.6-9.1,1644.3,7.9c-6.1-29.1-9.7-59.4-9.7-89.7 c0-215.7,174.5-391.3,391.3-391.3c112.7,0,214.4,47.2,285.9,123.6c88.4-17,173.3-49.7,248.4-94.5c-29.1,90.9-90.9,167.2-172,215.7 c78.7-8.5,155.1-30.3,225.3-60.6C2560.2-211.4,2493.6-142.4,2417.2-86.6z""/> </svg> Tweet This </a> </span></p>
<h3>You worked at Smart Growth America’s National Complete Streets Coalition in Washington, D.C. Massachusetts recently embarked on its Complete Streets program. What are the potential benefits?</h3>
<p>The most important data point for old-school planning was vehicle “throughput”—the maximum number of cars and trucks that can move on a road. Now communities are thinking differently. Their starting point is to design streets for people, not cars. And their criteria for a well-designed street is that it provide safety, efficiency, and even enjoyment no matter whether people travel by car, by bike, or by foot. A street that successfully balances all of these needs is what <a href=""https://smartgrowthamerica.org/program/national-complete-streets-coalition"">Smart Growth America</a> considers a “Complete Street.” <a href=""http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/highway/DoingBusinessWithUs/LocalAidPrograms/CompleteStreets.aspx"">MassDOT’s Complete Streets program</a> provides a framework to help communities prioritize how they will use their streets with limited space. If done well, a Complete Streets approach can improve the traveling experience, boost the local economy, and support people to live healthier, more active lives.</p>
<h3>Tell us about your new commute—what’s working well? And what would make it better?</h3>
<p>My new commute is very multi-modal. I ride my bike to the MBTA, travel under the Boston Harbor on the Blue Line, and then have the option to either take a Hubway bike or walk the rest of the way to the office. My commute is great. But, being in the tunnel, I’m missing the views of Boston and the skyline. I’d love to be above ground, maybe on a ferry—or even a bike-powered ferry(!)—to enjoy the fresh air and city views.</p>"
259,New Opportunity for Boston Nonprofits to Strengthen their Leadership Teams,"<p>The Bridgespan Group seeks applications for six cohorts of Leading for Impact–Boston, with participation subsidized by Barr and five area funders.</p>","<p>Organizations are at their strongest when the people who power them take the time to invest in themselves. Yet, driven by ambitious missions and the pressure to maximize every precious dollar, leaders of nonprofit organizations too often don’t invest enough in their own professional development. That is why Barr joined five other funders to introduce to the Boston area a program with a strong track record of helping nonprofits develop their leadership teams.</p>

<p>The Bridgespan Group’s <a href=""https://www.bridgespan.org/services/leading-for-impact/leading-for-impact-boston""><em>Leading for Impact</em> (LFI) program in Boston</a> builds on the success of LFI programs already taking place in Atlanta, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. The program has two main components. The first is a series of workshops focused on building strategic management and leadership skills. The second comprises customized projects, in which leadership teams apply what they’ve learned by tackling priority issues within their organizations, with coaching, feedback, and other resources provided by Bridgespan consultants.</p>

<p>LFI establishes cohorts of participants who share ideas and support each other along the way. That network approach has proven valuable to participants, as president and CEO of Urban Habitat and LFI graduate attests: “Oftentimes you feel isolated in this work…To know that you have others that are feeling the same things, you can share stories, you can share tears, you can share successes, all of those pieces is what really helps.” Nonprofit executives also complete the program with three or more members of their leadership teams—building capacity among a broader set of colleagues.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--that""> <p>know</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>LFI–Boston is now seeking participants for its first cohort of nonprofit leaders, who will begin the program in January 2017, as well as for future cohorts. According to Bridgespan, the curriculum is best suited for nonprofits eager to tackle pressing issues and to strengthen their capacity to do so as a team. The subsidized cost of the program for each nonprofit is $15,000 over two years. Bridgespan welcomes applications on a rolling basis. We invite you to <a href=""https://www.bridgespan.org/services/leading-for-impact/leading-for-impact-boston"">visit the LFI–Boston webpage to express interest and to learn more</a>, or email <span data-email=""href"" data-subject=""in"">href</span>, and one of Bridgespan’s program facilitators will reply to arrange a meeting.</p>

<p>Barr supports LFI–Boston through our <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/cross-program-initiatives"">Cross-Program Initiatives</a> and out of our commitment to invest in leaders. We know that supporting effective, visionary, and collaborative leaders is essential to driving change and we hope this resource encourages nonprofit leaders to focus on impact by investing in themselves and their teams.</p>

258,Boston Globe Op-Ed: What is the Vision for Boston’s Waterfront?,"<p>This article was originally published in the Opinion section of The Boston Globe on September 30, 2016.</p>","<p>The future of Boston’s waterfront is a hot topic these days. While most of the attention has centered on individual developments, the more fundamental question facing us right now is: What exactly is our aspiration for Boston’s waterfront?</p>

<p>Our waterfront is justifiably a source of civic pride and represents one of Boston’s most iconic features. When it was last threatened, due to pollution and neglect, we invested successfully in the harbor cleanup. Then, with the depression of the Central Artery, we further connected the waterfront to the city, setting the stage for the creation of a great public realm to benefit generations to come.</p>

<p>Today, Boston’s waterfront is threatened by piecemeal development decisions, with no overarching framework to guide development along the entire waterfront and too little attention given to regulations intended to protect it. Indeed, the current state of the Innovation District reminds us just how quickly things can change and demonstrates how the lack of a larger vision can lead to a disjointed result.</p>

<p>Shaping that larger vision is challenging, but the answer to what is best for Boston’s waterfront belongs to no one individual or entity. It belongs to all of us — as residents and stakeholders in our city’s future. Embracing our collective responsibility to insist upon a vision is essential. And, as a starting point, any vision should heed a few principles:</p>
<h3>Addressing resilience to sea level rise is essential</h3>
<p>As part of Climate Ready Boston, new research by the University of Massachusetts Boston reveals that we are profoundly vulnerable to sea level rise. By the turn of the century, Boston will experience sea level rise ranging from 3 to 7 feet that will submerge portions of the existing waterfront. We cannot ignore these realities.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--vision""> <p>a</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Everything we build along the water’s edge — whether buildings, parks, or open space — must address resilience. Accordingly, a comprehensive plan from the city that acknowledges this reality and provides guidance is essential. While some areas are already fully built out, there remain many neighborhoods where Boston meets the water — such as in East Boston, Fort Point, or Dorchester — that offer us great opportunities to develop open space in inclusive and resilient ways.</p>
<h3>Ensuring access for all — not just some — is vital</h3>
<p>Both advocating for a waterfront that can serve as a great public realm and advancing economic development can be mutually reinforcing. Examples like New York’s High Line prove that creating a great public realm can serve as a driver for economic growth. However, in an area as environmentally sensitive and historically important as the waterfront, development should be done responsibly, and with respect for existing regulations that embrace a long-term perspective and protect a public asset to be enjoyed by all.</p>

<p>Chapter 91 is an important tool that is often invoked in waterfront planning. Dating back to the earliest days of the Commonwealth, and established formally in 1866, it codifies a legal principle that “the air, the sea, and the shore belong not to any one person, but to the public at large.” This doctrine is especially important in guiding decisions about the use of the waterfront, and it’s a vital tool in protecting the public’s right.</p>
<h3>Engaging the public is paramount</h3>
<p>Mayor Walsh introduced this week the Boston Planning and Development Agency, formerly the BRA, part of an effort to respond to an earlier audit that called for a “dire need for reform.” At the announcement, city officials spoke of a greater emphasis on planning, community engagement, and two-way communication, with greater predictability about what gets built.</p>

<p>In addressing the future of the waterfront, the new BPDA is now positioned to demonstrate these attributes in action. Indeed, engaging communities more fully and transparently aligns well with a more comprehensive approach to our waterfront. How the new BPDA addresses waterfront planning offers a great opportunity to demonstrate culture change at the BPDA in action. (Disclosure: The BPDA’s current waterfront planning is being funded in part by the Barr Foundation).</p>

<p>The stakeholders in this important debate are many: residents who live along the waterfront, developers who seek to build alongside it, environmentalists who are concerned about the effects of climate change, and citizens and visitors who seek public space and deserve open access to a great resource. Having a vision — one that acknowledges our realities, is informed by our residents, and is comprehensive in scope — is imperative. We owe past generations the respect of stewarding a resource they left us, and we owe future generations a legacy they can enjoy and cherish.</p>

256,19 Funders Pledge $53 Million to Expand Energy Efficiency,"<p>Barr Foundation joins coordinated effort to bring proven technologies, solutions to developing countries most vulnerable to climate change.</p>","<p><em>UPDATE: On October 12, parties to the Montreal Protocol reached an agreement to phase out the use of harmful hydrofluorocarbons. The Barr Foundation is pleased to stand with other funders to ensure we seize the opportunity to increase energy efficiency, while reducing emissions of this potent greenhouse gas.</em></p>

<p>All over the world, people are experiencing the effects of climate change—effects that are becoming more devastating every year. Meanwhile, many solutions already exist but have not achieved anywhere near their potential reach.  That is why, today, the Barr Foundation is pleased to join an initial group of 19 donors pledging $53 million towards the High Ambition Climate Fund, a coordinated effort to support a massive expansion of energy efficiency in developing countries, while also phasing out a potent greenhouse gas (GHG): hydrofluorocarbons.</p>

<p>While Barr’s primary focus is to help catalyze and advance climate solutions and leadership across our region in ways that can spur broader action, from time to time we also engage in targeted national and global efforts where we see significant opportunities to contribute to impact. We saw this as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to have an impact on GHG emissions, in alignment with our goals related to energy. </p>

<p>This new fund emerged as a response to the “High Ambition Coalition,” a group of 100 nations that formed leading up to the climate talks in Paris last year. The Coalition includes many small island states and African nations that are among the most vulnerable in the world to climate change. To meet the aggressive climate goals that emerged from Paris, many countries are prioritizing an ambitious phase-out of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are potent greenhouse gas chemicals used for cooling and refrigerants, and are up to 10,000 times more potent than carbon dioxide in causing climate change.</p>

<p>Rather than merely replacing appliances with comparable alternatives that do not emit HFCs, this also presents an opportunity to reduce energy use through efficiency. Yet scant funding exists to leverage this opportunity.</p>

<p>The High Ambition Climate Fund was launched to fill this funding gap and to enable a dramatic expansion of energy-efficiency technologies and solutions into these countries. Based on the impact we’ve seen of concerted investments in energy efficiency across the Northeast, we know this has enormous potential to curb household energy costs and to grow clean energy jobs.</p>

<p>The announcement of the High Ambition Climate Fund comes two weeks before the next round of global climate negotiations in Kigali, Rwanda—considered the first major opportunity to slow climate change since the historic climate change accord in Paris 10 months ago. Studies show that phasing out HFCs could avoid up to 0.5°C of global warming by the end of the century. Combined with the energy efficiency gains and related carbon pollution savings that will be supported by the philanthropic funds, these efforts have the potential to avoid 1°C of global warming. For context, if every nation fulfills its commitment from the Paris agreement, that will at most reduce warming by l.5°C. </p>

255,Barr Launches New Initiative to Support Off-Track Youth,<p>The Education Program issues Request for Information and invites responses through October 21.</p>,"<p>The start of the school year always represents an exciting time of transition for students, families, and educators. Yet despite the promise that a new school year holds for many—new opportunities, progression toward a diploma, graduation, and other meaningful outcomes—far too many students in New England are unable to connect to success.</p>

<p>Recognizing this challenge, I am excited to announce a new initiative with the goal of improving and/or creating a new generation of schools and programs to ensure higher levels of success for off-track students. Our starting point is an information-gathering phase. We extend an invitation to current practitioners, thought leaders, and visionaries in the work of designing new (or improving existing) schools or programs that focus on off-track student populations to introduce us to your current work and aspirations via this <a href=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/102/attachments/Barr_Education_RFI.pdf?1474551210"">Request for Information</a>.</p>

<p>Responses to this RFI will provide a baseline assessment of both interest and capacity within New England, and establish a critical foundation from which Barr can catalyze and support a broader regional initiative. Barr will identify partners to support in this initiative through a competitive RFP process, which we expect to launch later in the fall. We anticipate providing both design and implementation support to school and program operators focused on high-quality school and program design, as well as other partners focused on investments in technical assistance, data, evaluation, policy and advocacy, and communications and engagement.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--excited""> <p>am</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>To learn more about the RFI, I encourage you to <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/education/engage-new-england"">visit our new web page for this initiative</a>.</p>

<p>In launching this new initiative, we must acknowledge that secondary education in New England as we know it must change. <em>So how can we support those organizations dedicated to serving off-track students while simultaneously catalyzing broader change?</em></p>

<p>As a starting point, we need to understand, and consider together, the nature and scope of the challenges. In looking at specific student performance and sub-population data for the region, we have been able to identify off-track high school youth as a very distinct population that, as one of the region’s most under-served student populations, represents an urgent need for new secondary options. We look forward to sharing this analysis in more detail in the coming months.</p>

<p>We also have a sense of what works with off-track students. Proof points exist—both within and outside of New England—to show that students who fall off track in high school can achieve graduation and post-secondary success. Student success is contingent upon having schools and programs with designs that are flexible and responsive to specific student needs. While effective schools, programs, and practices exist, much more needs to be done to capture and scale what works, inform and train a broader set of school and organizational leaders and practitioners, enable innovation, and build effective communities of practice that can learn from and support each other.</p>

<p>This evidence aligns with the kinds of learning experiences that are critical for all students: deeply personalized learning, a clear focus on student engagement and agency, and strong linkages to post-secondary and career opportunities. A distinct initiative focused on improving secondary options for off-track youth presents a tremendous opportunity to support not only the efforts of existing practitioners and organizations, but also continued innovation focused on new school and program designs and models. What works for off-track student can work for <em>all</em> students, and efforts to support New England’s off-track youth can inform, augment, and enhance opportunities for all secondary students across the region.</p>

<p>We believe that investments in off-track students are critically important. The region’s dominant narrative of success does not apply here: rising graduation rates and connections to post-secondary success in both school and career do not yet apply to these students, and in fact mask a broader and growing achievement gap. The initiative launched today by Barr’s Education Program is our first step in communicating that we want to support these students by supporting the practitioners, organizations, and individuals that are committed to their success. We also seek to catalyze and connect a broader community of organizations and advocates that support New England’s off-track youth.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--to""> <p>want</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>A growing national movement to rethink secondary education is underway in the United States, focused on efforts to connect more students to success in high school, college, and career, and Barr is fully supportive of this movement. We are also committed to ensuring that off-track students—and the schools, programs, and research that are focused on them—are included in both regional and national endeavors to re-imagine secondary education.</p>

<p>As we look to build on growing national momentum for a new vision of secondary education, opportunities exist to create space to push our thinking, to innovate, and to do more for New England’s off-track secondary students. We know that a community of practitioners share our belief in the potential of these students and have high expectations for all of them. We want to support their efforts to ensure that off-track students have equitable access to high-quality schools and programs that will allow them to achieve their potential in and beyond secondary environments. Connecting more students to success is a long-term vision that builds on existing strengths in our region, but also challenges us to think differently. There is an urgent need to act in support of New England’s off-track youth, and we hope that many will join us in efforts to do so.</p>

254,More Than Words on a Website,<p>Barr’s president on how the Foundation’s core values animate its work.</p>,"<p>Two years ago, the Barr Foundation’s trustees outlined six core values, which were intended to guide the Foundation both today and well into the future. When I introduced them (<a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/from-the-president-fall-2014"">in this blog post</a>), I emphasized that, in order for these concepts to have meaning and relevance, our values would need to be far more than a set of aspirational statements on our website; they would need to be expressed daily in our work.</p>

<p>At a staff retreat last week, we reflected as a team upon Barr’s values and discussed how they came to life in our work, as well as what challenges we faced. Through that discussion, we kept returning to three principal tensions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Long-Term Perspective and Urgent Needs:</strong> First, how does our value to “adopt a long-term perspective,” and to focus on “future generations,” align with remaining attuned and responsive to urgent needs and pressing opportunities today?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>&quot;Embracing risk” and Thoughtful Due Diligence:</strong> Second, as we “embrace risk” in the pursuit of ambitious goals, are there aspects of our due diligence process that inadvertently dampen our partners’ very capacity to take risks?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Humility and Willingness to Lead:</strong> Third, with a focus to “act with humility and modesty,” do we sometimes miss opportunities where Barr’s public engagement and voice can help frame and advance issues of shared concern?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are no easy answers to these questions; at their heart, they put in bold relief some of the tensions core to the work of organized philanthropy. What’s important is to surface and grapple with these questions, and to avoid the temptation to simplify what are complex factors to weigh.</p>

<p>Reflecting on our staff discussion last week, and Barr’s various engagements over the past year, here are some of my thoughts on these questions:</p>

<p>On long-term perspective, foundations are often uniquely positioned to take the long view, largely unencumbered by market conditions or political considerations. At the same time, that should not lead us to ignore what’s before us today.</p>

<p>For example, our <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/education"">Education Program</a> focuses on increasing the number of students who connect to secondary and post-secondary success, with a clear orientation toward the future. At the same time, we bring to this vital work a deep sense of urgency as we cannot wait to address the conditions facing many young people today. Our Education strategy aims to strike this important balance between the urgent and the long-term, and we are focused on that balance across the Foundation’s work.</p>

<p>With regard to risk, we know that ambitious goals require comfort with failure and the need to experiment and to test ideas. We also hold with care the obligation to be careful stewards of the resources at our disposal, which can lead us to create institutional processes that may actually discourage risk. What helps us to strike this balance is our capacity to build and foster trusting relationships with our partners that enable us to engage in discussions about risk together.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--no""> <p>are</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>In our Climate work, for example, our focus on improving public transportation in Boston has led us to explore and to foster dialogue about the potential to integrate <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/bus-rapid-transit-may-put-transit-excellence-in-reach"">world-class bus rapid transit</a> (a.k.a. “BRT”) with our current system. Helping to shift the public discussion from what isn’t working to what’s possible, and actually seeing new mobility innovations take root, is no easy task. The journey requires great comfort with ambiguity, risk, and the possibility of failure. Yet the potential rewards, both in terms of improved mobility and greater access for those underserved by the current system, are significant. So our ongoing discussions with partners are about how to respond and navigate these risks together—not to avoid or eliminate them.</p>

<p>And finally, we firmly believe that we can hold simultaneously an institutional commitment to humility and a willingness to exercise leadership—so long as we are fully focused on action, results, and impact. </p>

<p>This year, we stepped forward to help elevate a public debate about <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/stewarding-a-boston-treasure"">the future of Boston’s waterfront</a>. In a context where planning and development of this great public treasure appeared to be happening in a rapid, and often uncoordinated, manner, we saw an opportunity to speak up and to call for a larger vision—one that would balance sensible and responsible development with the creation and protection of a great public realm worthy of a world-class city; one that would confront head-on the need to address the inevitable reality of sea-level rise; and one that focused explicitly on a goal of ensuring open access for all to this great public treasure. We know that advancing such a vision will require both our financial investment and our ongoing engagement as a stakeholder in that outcome. That’s why our voice will remain active.</p>

<p>My intent in sharing these reflections is to continue to lend transparency to our thinking at Barr. We know that by having our partners understand how we think about our values in action contributes to enhancing how we work together. In that spirit, we welcome your reflections and advice as we continue our focus on ensuring that Barr’s values are manifest in all that we do. Please share your comments below.</p>

<p>Also of note for us at our retreat last week was the addition of three new members to our team this summer. So I will close this note by acknowledging our new colleagues: <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/ten-questions-with-barr-s-new-vice-president"">Roger Nozaki</a> as vice president, Meredith Hatfield as program officer for Clean Energy, and <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/lisa-jacobson-to-join-barr-foundation-climate-team"">Lisa Jacobson</a> as program officer for Mobility. Collectively they bring rich and broad experiences to their new roles, and we are delighted to have them as colleagues in advancing Barr’s ambitious agenda.</p>"
253,An Exit Interview with a Transportation Champion,"<p>Reflections, lessons learned, and advice from Kristina Egan at the close of her five-year tenure as Transportation for Massachusetts executive director.</p>","<p>In 2010, the Barr Foundation helped launch <a href=""http://www.t4ma.org"">Transportation for Massachusetts (T4MA)</a>, a statewide coalition that has since become an influential voice in efforts to advance a modern, statewide transportation network in Massachusetts. In May, T4MA announced that Kristina Egan, who has led T4MA as executive for over five years, and who has become a close colleague and friend to many of us, would be leaving the organization, following her appointment as executive director of the Greater Portland Council of Governments in Portland, Maine.</p>

<p>In Kristina’s final weeks in Boston, I had the chance to catch up with her and to invite her reflections on her years with T4MA, on the Coalition’s successes and challenges, and her advice for those continuing this work.  The following is excerpted from our conversation.</p>
<h4>MSR: In five years, T4MA has grown from an idea, to a meeting of a half dozen interested colleagues, to 58 organizations from across the state.  Let’s think back to when T4MA first came together.  What was the impetus for starting the coalition?</h4>
<p>KE: There were a variety of groups within the state focusing on pieces of transportation work that had some interaction, but did not always coordinate efforts.  These groups shared principles they were trying to promote, such as reducing greenhouse gases and expanding opportunity for all people through public transit and transit-oriented development. </p>
<h4>MSR: I remember this time well because I was receiving multiple grant requests that were overlapping in scope.</h4>
<p>KE: I believe it. Over time, I think it became clear to many of these organizations that there were big challenges to advancing their shared principles—many of which resided in the policy realm.  They realized that to overcome these challenges and impact policy, they needed to more tightly band together.  The Coalition provided a vehicle for the member organizations to focus on specific policies each could tackle, while working towards a shared long-term goal.</p>
<h4>MSR: As you look back over your years with T4MA, what are you most proud of?</h4>
<p>KE: When I think of big successes, I think that right now, the MBTA is buying red line and orange line cars. I don’t believe that would have happened without the revenue campaign we did in 2013, which raised about $600 million annually in new funding for transportation. This amount was far from our goal of $1 billion. But what the revenue campaign did was to get transportation on the agenda of policy discussions.  That was a win we could build off of.  And we did, focusing our efforts on raising even more revenue in the following years, and on ensuring that funds were directed to public transportation.  In fact, we were able to redirect about $300 million of state money to MBTA bus purchases and repairs. </p>

<p>Another big win our advocacy contributed to was the creation of the <a href=""http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/highway/DoingBusinessWithUs/LocalAidPrograms/CompleteStreets.aspx"">Complete Streets Funding Program</a>.  I like the Smart Growth America definition of “Complete Streets”—they are streets for everyone. They are designed and operated to enable safe access for all users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists, and transit riders of all ages and abilities. Complete Streets make it easy to cross the street, walk to shops, and bicycle to work.</p>

<p>This is an approach many other places are using to great results, including New York, which also measured the impacts on safety and economic vitality in its <a href=""http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/2012-10-measuring-the-street.pdf"">“Measuring the Street”</a> report.</p>

<p>Massachusetts’ new program makes state money available for cities and towns that want to start designing their streets with these principles in mind.  Since it launched this year, more than 200 communities have expressed interest in this program, which is almost two thirds of the cities and towns in Massachusetts.  Clearly there is a demand for streets that work for everyone, not just people who drive, and this program is helping to satisfy that demand. Residents of the Commonwealth should have greater options for walking, biking, or public transit, and these wins are really moving us in that direction to improve how people get around the Commonwealth.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--is""> <p>there</p> </blockquote></p>
<h4>MSR: As you think back on these big wins, what worked well? What would you highlight for others engaged in similar work?</h4>
<p>KE: The first critical piece of our campaign was research and analysis to really understand what the challenges were, and—this was critical—what people’s experiences were trying to get around our state. What were their frustrations? What were there hopes? And what were the opportunities? Once we had a handle on that, our campaign to spark and expand a new conversation depended on three pieces working in alignment.</p>

<p>First was communications and media work, drawing on a set of reports we did that helped people understand the scope of the transportation problem and pointed towards solutions.  We worked to frame our campaigns in a way that resonated with Massachusetts residents and that got the media engaged and talking about the issues.  The second piece was advocacy work to mobilize leaders—a.k.a., the “grass tops.” We engaged policy-makers and made sure they were informed about the issues and knew there were direct calls for change from leaders in communities across the state.  At the same time, through outreach and organizing at the community level, our members worked to build grassroots demand and keeps the issues moving forward.  Through the T4MA network, we were really able to mobilize people and get engagement at each of these levels—from residents in low-income communities to business leaders, all speaking out about how these issues impacted them.</p>
<h4>MSR: You’re leaving the Coalition at a time when it’s very strong, and much of that is to your credit.  But, there was a moment in T4MA’s history where the coalition almost disbanded.  What turned it all around?</h4>
<p>KE: The Coalition members were not used to working together day to day, and it took a while for them to gel.  Sometimes when a group of passionate, intelligent people are in a room together and all want to be heard, it’s difficult for them to realize that the person next to them is saying the same thing, only using different words.  Eventually, I think the members realized that if they just gave up a little of their individual fight, then they could conquer the bigger challenges that were standing in the way.  The Coalition could aim higher than any of the single organizations could, and achieve a significant goal, as long as they were willing to focus on a common agenda.  </p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--and""> <p>more</p> </blockquote></p>
<h4>MSR: The part you’re leaving out is your abundant skills in diplomacy and negotiation that provided a level of leadership the Coalition so desperately needed.</h4>
<p>KE: Thank you.</p>
<h4>MSR: Thank you for saying yes to the invitation to lead T4MA over five years ago! Since then, what’s the most significant shift in thinking about transportation that you’ve seen?</h4>
<p>KE: When I started this work, many advocates saw transportation issues as “roads verses transit.” That frame has really faded away.  Part of that is because the lines between modes have blurred—there are now bikes with electric motors, shared cars in carpool lanes, “pop-up” mass transit like Bridj.  With more and more choices for how people move around, there is a growing sense that we all have a stake in the whole system working well.</p>
<h4>MSR: Given that there is clearly so much more to do, what makes you most hopeful?</h4>
<p>KE: There are new technologies and mobility models with the potential to move us forward rapidly and in a sustainable direction. Consumer attitudes are changing—more people are thinking about their cars as a burden. There is also an increased awareness that something in transportation needs to change.  Traffic congestion is reaching intolerable levels and reliability of public transportation is not what it should be. Polls are also showing that it is very clear to Massachusetts residents how important high-quality public transit is in people’s lives—including for people who choose to drive. Because when it doesn’t work, or work well enough, more people end up driving.</p>

<p>These things give me hope for a sustainable, 21st-century transportation system.   </p>
<h4>MSR: What advice do you have for those who will be carrying this work forward?</h4>
<p>KE: The field is changing so rapidly that transportation organizations and advocates should commit to being in a learning space. Don’t focus so narrowly on your effort that it causes short sightedness.  Stay abreast of all the changes happening around you and consider how they can help achieve your goal of a climate-friendly transportation system.</p>
<h4>MSR: Thank you, Kristina—for speaking with me today and for all you’ve done over the last five years with T4MA. You have truly been a transportation champion. We will miss you greatly. And we will watch with great interest and expectation your next act at the helm of the Greater Portland Council of Governments.</h4>
<p>KE: Thank you. It has been a privilege to do this work with such talented, committed partners. I’ll be watching what comes next for Massachusetts with interest too.</p>"
251,What is Personalized Learning Anyway?,"<p>Jenny Curtin, senior program officer in Education, shares about what it is (and isn’t) and promising examples of key elements taking root in our region.</p>","<p>With growing recognition that our traditional, “one-size-fits-all” approach to education is not working for all students, the idea of personalizing a student’s learning has been gaining a lot of attention over the last several years. It is also a central piece of Barr’s goal to connect all students to success in and beyond high school. Yet there is still wide variation in how people define what is—and what isn’t—personalized learning. Further, there are a variety of terms that are used to describe similar concepts, such as student-centered learning.</p>

<p>The national organization iNACOL surveys thousands of educators each year and, informed by practitioners’ perspectives, offers this <a href=""http://www.inacol.org/news/what-is-personalized-learning"">definition of personalized learning</a>:</p>

<p><em>“Tailoring learning for each student’s strengths, needs and interests—including enabling student voice and choice in what, how, when and where they learn—to provide flexibility and supports to ensure mastery of the highest standards possible.”</em></p>

<p>This definition resonates with our own research. In May, Barr surveyed 125 education professionals in New England (stay tuned for the complete survey results). A response from a high school leader featured similar elements in how personalized learning is playing out in her high school:</p>

<p><em>“Students are placed in courses based on demonstrated skill and content knowledge, not grade level or age. Courses are culturally relevant and engaging. Students progress academically based on demonstrating competence on content/skill. A student’s social and emotional needs are assessed consistently throughout their time at the school and interventions are appropriately applied to ensure they are academically successful.”</em></p>

<p>While personalized learning can be implemented in a variety of ways, there are two common misconceptions regarding the practice. First, personalized learning does not mean that rigorous, common college- and career-ready academic standards should be relinquished. In other words, personalized learning does not mean that academic standards are personalized. On the contrary, organizations—including new partners of Barr—are using personalized learning approaches as a vehicle to increase academic achievement and to ensure all students are fully prepared for post-secondary success. Second, personalized learning is not only about education technology. Online, blended learning, and technology tools used to track student progress can be helpful means to personalize the learning experience, but the use of these tools is not essential or the end goal.</p>

<p>Although there are various definitions of personalized learning, they generally share the common theme of addressing the strengths, needs, interests, goals, and attributes of individual students. And while implementing personalized learning across all aspects of a school and for all students is the goal, we recognize that is a complex, long-term undertaking. As we work towards this vision, we are already seeing many exciting features of personalized learning in practice, including by some  of our newest grantees.</p>

<p>Below are several hallmark characteristics of personalized learning, along with examples of our partners that are putting them into practice at the high school level:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Provide a menu of high-quality pathways for students to freely choose based on their own interests and needs</strong>. At the macro level, a variety of diploma-granting pathways can provide options for students to personalize their high school experience. <a href=""http://www.gatewaytocollege.org""><strong>Gateway to College</strong></a> is accomplishing this by providing a rigorous early college alternative to traditional high school that takes place entirely on a college campus and targets the specific needs of disconnected youth. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Competency-based progression and graduation</strong> focuses on ensuring students are acquiring the knowledge and skills needed to meet rigorous college- and career-ready standards. This model also allows students to progress at their own pace—receiving more support on the areas in which they need the most assistance. <a href=""http://themapacademy.org""><strong>Map Academy</strong></a>, a prospective Commonwealth charter school for overage and under-credited students, proposes to have a competency-based model that includes both academic and socio-emotional learning competencies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Schools take advantage of community assets for formal out-of-classroom learning opportunities that are aligned with students’ interests and goals</strong>. A school does not need to be defined by the walls of the building. <a href=""http://kippma.org""><strong>KIPP Massachusetts</strong></a> will develop and implement a replicable new high school design at KIPP Academy Lynn Collegiate to better prepare students for college and career opportunities, which will include new options in the school day for external learning opportunities.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Students develop their own secondary and post-secondary plan</strong>. Personal or individual learning plans can be the means to help develop student voice and personalize their learning. <a href=""http://www.onegoalgraduation.org""><strong>OneGoal</strong></a>, which is expanding from Chicago to several urban communities in Massachusetts, provides a credit-bearing high school course in which students develop individual plans for post-secondary education based on their needs and interests.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We are eager to learn alongside all of these partners, and many others, over the coming months and years as we continue to develop and refine Barr’s efforts to increase the number of students connecting to secondary and post-secondary opportunities.</p>"
250,Embracing Openness to Increase Effectiveness,<p>Barr joins funder collaborative to increase openness and effectiveness in philanthropy.</p>,"<p>In <a href=""http://research.effectivephilanthropy.org/sharing-what-matters-foundation-transparency"">research released in February</a> of this year, The Center for Effective Philanthropy (CEP) found that both foundation and nonprofit leaders characterize transparency as “representing the values of clarity, openness, and honesty,” and 86% of foundation leaders surveyed believe transparency is necessary for building strong relationships with grantees.</p>

<p>And yet, the report continues:</p>

<p>“There is significant room for improvement in the degree to which foundations’ practices match the beliefs of their leaders about what is important to increase foundation effectiveness,” in particular when it comes to sharing how they assess their performance or their lessons learned. While this may not be news to many, it is one that is increasingly discussed, clarified by research such as CEP’s, and needs to be addressed.</p>

<p>In view of this challenge for our field, the Barr Foundation has joined the <a href=""http://www.fundforsharedinsight.org"">Fund for Shared Insight</a> with a grant of $100,000 to support its efforts—and those of its grantee partners—to increase foundation openness. Shared Insight is an ambitious collaborative funding effort launched in 2014, grounded in the belief that philanthropy will be more effective if foundation culture is characterized by more sharing and listening, in particular with the people foundations aim to help. It provides grants to support better feedback loops, research, and foundation openness—which goes beyond one-way transmission of information to authentic exchange that informs foundations’ work going forward.</p>

<p>In July, the Fund for Shared Insight <a href=""http://www.fundforsharedinsight.org/news/2016/7/25/shared-insight-adds-new-partners-as-it-enters-its-third-year"">announced a new round of grants to increase foundation openness</a> in service of effectiveness. Over the next two years, it will grant $2.6 million to 10 organizations working toward this goal through a variety of approaches and projects. These range from workshops and labs to research and analysis to new practical tools and resources hosted online. At Barr, we are particularly interested in opportunities for our New England region to engage in the work of Shared Insight’s partners and benefit from the initiative’s cumulative learning.</p>

<p>One of the three broad goals for Barr’s <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/cross-program-initiatives"">Cross-Program Initiatives</a> that we <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/introducing-cross-program-initiatives"">shared this spring</a> is to support infrastructure for the nonprofit and philanthropic sectors, and among the initial priorities outlined is a focus on improving the practice of philanthropy. The Fund for Shared Insight is an effort to do just that, and we are pleased to have the opportunity to invest in Shared Insight, collaborate with and learn from peer funders deeply engaged in this work, and advance shared goals with these peers and our grantee partners.</p>"
248,#ReasonsForHope,"<p>In a challenging time for our country and world, dozens of foundation presidents join their voices in a campaign promoting hope.</p>","<p>Any act of philanthropy is fundamentally a hopeful one: we invest in people and institutions because we are inspired by their commitment to advance change, and we believe in their potential to make our world a better place. The challenges before us are enormous—and the times we live in seem to erode our confidence in the possibility of a brighter future. Yet, it is precisely at moments like this that we need to remind ourselves of the power of possibility and aspiration.</p>

<p>That is the spirit with which we at the Barr Foundation joined 38 other foundation colleagues across the country in the statement below (<a href=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/95/attachments/ReasonsforHope_BarrFoundation.pdf?1470061680"">“From Our History, Hope”</a>) that appeared in several national and regional newspapers on Sunday, July 31.</p>

<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" data-lang=""en""><p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">Today, foundations across the US join together to begin this important conversation. Share your <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/reasonsforhope?src=hash"">#reasonsforhope</a>.  <a href=""https://t.co/rRsDqeZ7tE"">https://t.co/rRsDqeZ7tE</a></p>&mdash; Barr Foundation (@BarrFdn) <a href=""https://twitter.com/BarrFdn/status/759760226711138304"">July 31, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>Even in moments of crisis and uncertainty, we believe that “ideas, inspiration and action abound.” What sustains that belief and our hope are the remarkable organizations and talented leaders we in foundations are able to support. We are grateful every day for the opportunities we are given to engage with, learn from, and support such courageous leaders. There is no greater privilege.</p>

<p>And yet, it can be easy to let the mechanics of our industry distract us from what hope requires. In our impatience for results, we can get caught up in the need for measurable metrics and tangible outcomes. We can create complex processes that undermine our partners’ ability to be nimble and responsive to change. And in the name of rigor and accountability, we can end up risk-averse in our grantmaking and play it too safe.</p>

<p>That’s why this moment is important. Yes, the challenges are many and the progress often slower than we may like, but if we in the foundation community neglect to embrace hope and to aspire for a better day, our foundations might as well cease to exist.</p>

<p>Yes, this should be a moment for foundations to reaffirm the hope and joy that must infuse our work each and every day. It should also be a moment for us to look critically at what we do and how we do it to ensure our efforts affirm hope and create change for the better.</p>

<p>My <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/reasonsforhope?f=tweets&vertical=news&src=hash"">#reasonsforhope</a> include my conviction that we in philanthropy can fulfill that promise.</p>

247,Activating Creativity in Your Community this Summer,"<p>Artists are performing in neighborhoods across Boston, and the only thing missing is you.</p>","<p>Summer is here, and arts and creativity are in full swing in Boston. Through the New England Foundation for the Arts’ (NEFA) <a href=""http://nefa.org/creative-city-grant"">Creative City grant program</a>, artists are enlivening our neighborhoods with projects designed to engage audiences in new places and in new, creative ways.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, I attended the Cultural Plenzano Bombazo Project featuring musician Jorge Arce and Raiz de Plena. The group presented traditional Puerto Rican music and dancing at Mozart Park in Jamaica Plain. This was my first visit to Mozart Park, a small area flanked by two busy streets, but I felt right at home upon entering. Half an hour before the performance was scheduled to begin, a lively crowd had already gathered. Some people had claimed seats in the stage area, but most lingered in the park’s green spaces, talking to friends or watching with curiosity as another Creative City artist, Cedric Douglas, assembled a pop-up art wall.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -aside -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img alt=""Creative City, Cedric Douglas"" class=""Media-image"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/crop/1314/square_crop.jpg?1529010630"" /> </div> </div></p>

<p>Young children and families with strollers moved through the park while teenagers played pick-up basketball on the court. Arce and his fellow performers had set up a “backstage area,” but there was no sense of exclusivity or separation from the crowds. Several people came up to chat with the musicians before the show; musicians hailed friends from across the park; dancers in flowing skirts stretched and warmed up in the grass; an immediately popular someone arrived to delivered free J.P. Licks ice cream to all comers. There was a warm, inviting sense of camaraderie—watching the artists blend so naturally into the crowd felt like a show unto itself.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -aside -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img alt=""Creative City, NEFA"" class=""Media-image"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/crop/1313/square_crop.jpg?1529010914"" /> </div> </div></p>

<p>The official show started with a (drum) bang as the nearly 15 musicians and dancers boogied into the park. After a rousing entrance song, Mr. Arce introduced his impressive line-up of musicians—which included the audience. “This isn’t a true bombazo if you don’t all do it,” he encouraged. A few audience members eagerly leapt up to dance in the square, and soon a large portion of the audience was moving along to the beats and dancing with abandon.</p>

<p>This sense of community and the distinctive cultures of Boston neighborhoods is the driving force behind Creative City, which NEFA launched in 2015 with funding from Barr. <span class=""InlineTweet""> <span class=""InlineTweet-content"">simple</span> <a class=""InlineTweet-cta"" href=""https://twitter.com/intent/tweet/?dnt=true&amp;text=goal""> <svg width=""48"" height=""48"" viewBox=""628 -718 2048 2048"" class=""Icon"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg""> <path d=""M2417.2-86.6c1.2,17,1.2,33.9,1.2,50.9c0,517.3-393.8,1113.4-1113.4,1113.4c-221.7,0-427.7-64.2-601-175.7 c31.5,3.6,61.8,4.8,94.5,4.8c183,0,351.4-61.8,485.8-167.2c-172-3.6-316.2-116.3-365.9-271.4c24.2,3.6,48.5,6.1,73.9,6.1 c35.1,0,70.3-4.8,103-13.3C916.1,424.7,781.6,267.2,781.6,76.9c0-1.2,0-3.6,0-4.8c52.1,29.1,112.7,47.2,176.9,49.7 C853.1,51.5,784-68.4,784-204.2c0-72.7,19.4-139.3,53.3-197.5C1030-164.2,1319.6-9.1,1644.3,7.9c-6.1-29.1-9.7-59.4-9.7-89.7 c0-215.7,174.5-391.3,391.3-391.3c112.7,0,214.4,47.2,285.9,123.6c88.4-17,173.3-49.7,248.4-94.5c-29.1,90.9-90.9,167.2-172,215.7 c78.7-8.5,155.1-30.3,225.3-60.6C2560.2-211.4,2493.6-142.4,2417.2-86.6z""/> </svg> Tweet This </a> </span>—through creative work that requires audience participation and is realized in public spaces.</p>

<p>Creative City grants are open to individuals, artists’ collectives, and multiple artists working in collaboration who live within the Greater Boston area and whose work is “site-specific” to—i.e., it is tailor-made to be created and experienced in—Boston. Work of all disciplines, aesthetics, and cultures is encouraged, and the hope is to spark the creativity of audiences to add to the final product, which—as my evening in Mozart Park demonstrated—can range from a tangible object like Mr. Douglas’s art wall to simply a shared experience of community abandon, like dancing with a group of strangers to the groove of the plena y bombazo.</p>

246,New Findings Confirm Climate Risks Facing Boston,<p>Projections establish a clear baseline for what climate effects Boston needs to plan for and when.</p>,"<p>While the broad outlines of how climate change would impact Boston have been known for some time, it is only recently that we have developed a more definitive understanding of what lies ahead. That understanding was advanced considerably with the publication of <a href=""http://climateready.boston.gov/findings""><em>Climate Change and Sea Level Rise Projections for Boston</em></a> by the Boston Research Advisory Group (BRAG).</p>

<p>The BRAG report is the first major product of “Climate Ready Boston,” a project led by the City of Boston in partnership with the Green Ribbon Commission and funded in part by the Barr Foundation. The BRAG team includes 20 leading experts from the region’s major universities on subjects ranging from sea level rise to temperature extremes. University of Massachusetts Boston professors Ellen Douglas and Paul Kirshen headed the research.</p>

<p>The BRAG report validates earlier studies, concluding Boston will get hotter, wetter, and saltier in the decades ahead (see figures below). But the group has produced a much more definitive set of projections than existed previously, especially for the problem of sea level rise. BRAG also concluded that some of the effects of climate change will come sooner than expected, accelerating the urgency of planning and action.</p>

<p>The BRAG’s regional assessment of sea level rise is the first to incorporate new findings about the gravitational effects of ice-sheet melt, ocean dynamics, and land subsidence that have special significance for Boston and New England. These factors are combined with more well-known contributors to sea level rise: thermal expansion and ice-sheet melt. BRAG concludes that relative sea level rise in Boston will “likely exceed the global average throughout the 21st century,” regardless of how effective the international community is in reducing carbon emissions.  In addition, because there is a large amount of inertia built into the ocean system, sea level rise will continue well beyond 2100, even if all green house gas emissions were stopped today.  </p>

<p>The BRAG team projects 4 to 8 inches of sea level rise (above Boston Harbor levels in 2000) by 2030 and 7 inches to 1.5 feet by 2050. For the latter half of this century, the range of projections diverges more significantly, with 2.4 to 7.4 feet projected by the end of the century. The lower end of this range reflects a moderate emissions path and the higher end reflects a higher emissions trajectory (see Table 1-1 in the BRAG report for more detail). The BRAG team asserts there is a two-out-of-three chance that changes in sea level within these ranges will occur—a sobering thought for a city where much of the waterfront lies within a foot or two of the water at high tide. (Note also that the BRAG scientists found that the maximum amount of relative sea level rise possible by the end of the century is about 10 feet—but, fortunately, the likelihood of that happening or being exceeded was pegged at about 1 in a 1,000).</p>

<p>While the scientists in the BRAG team believe that intensity of tropical storms (e.g., hurricanes) is likely to increase over time, they found that there is not yet enough data to reliably project precisely how storm regimes that affect Boston will change.</p>

<p>Regardless of how different future storms are in terms of frequency and intensity, one of the most important consequences of rising seas in Boston Harbor will be increases in the frequency of major, storm-induced flooding. Because the level of water in Boston Harbor will get steadily higher over the decades ahead, severe flooding that presently has only a 1% chance of occurring in any given year could have a higher than 20% annual likelihood by the year 2050. And by 2100, severe flooding may occur as frequently as every day at high tide—even if there is no change in the intensity or frequency of tropical storms (see Table 2-1 in the BRAG report).</p>

<p>Projections from the BRAG report will inform the next phase of Climate Ready Boston, a detailed vulnerability assessment of what and whom will be most at risk over the decades ahead and what kinds of resiliency initiatives should be launched to address those risks.</p>

<p>At the same time, the new body of information from the highly respected team of scientists at BRAG should provide a much stronger and more credible basis for siting and designing new buildings, regulating new development throughout the city, and building more resilience into critical infrastructure. This calls for a great deal of cooperation between the public and private sectors. But we know enough now to get started. Let’s not wait until the next storm hits.</p>

244,Taking Creativity to the Streets in Nashville,"<p>James Corless, director of Transportation for America, offers lessons from Nashville’s push for a bigger, better transit network.</p>","<p><em>While Barr’s mobility portfolio is principally focused on Massachusetts, we also pursue targeted national opportunities to support partners, like <a href=""http://transportationforamerica.org/"">Transportation for America (T4A)</a>, to bring intellectual or financial resources to Massachusetts, and/or to provide platforms to share the effective work of partners in our local region. We recently invited James Corless, Transportation for America director, to share what lessons mobility efforts in Nashville, Tennessee, might have for the Boston region.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>Many know Nashville for its country music, or even the eponymous reality TV show. But Nashville is also booming economically, attracting big companies as well as small start-ups, and is welcoming the world to its doorstep as a refugee resettlement center.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this change, Nashville is bringing its creativity and entrepreneurial spirit to new initiatives that include civic engagement, creative placemaking, and developing a bold new vision for a regional mass transit system.</p>

<p>These efforts certainly haven’t come easily. Nashville has been growing by leaps and bounds for more than a decade and has known for some time that it was following an exponential growth curve. Even before the turn of the most recent century, demographic projections had the Nashville region’s population doubling from 1 million to 2 million by 2040. Business and civic leaders recognized that they had to get ahead of this curve, to make sure they engaged in smart planning that could both help manage their growth and build the infrastructure to keep up with it.</p>

<p>Early leadership on public transportation came from the Nashville Area Metropolitan Planning Organization, an advocacy group known as the Transit Alliance, and the Nashville Chamber of Commerce. Nashville’s mayor at the time, Karl Dean, threw his political support behind a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pnrJ3V0q_I"">signature bus rapid transit project dubbed the “Amp.”</a> On paper, the project was a transit planner’s dream. It would serve as a west-east connector, linking Vanderbilt University to downtown and the new Convention Center, by following a route across the Cumberland River to the Tennessee Titans Stadium and into east Nashville. </p>

<p><div class=""Media -full""> <div class=""u-fluid-iframe""> <div class=""u-fluid-iframe-inner""> <iframe src=""//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2pnrJ3V0q_I?controls=2&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;wmode=transparent"" title=""Featured Video"" frameborder=""0"" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen loading=""lazy""> <a href=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2pnrJ3V0q_I?controls=2&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;wmode=transparent"">A video on YouTube</a> </iframe> </div> </div> </div></p>

<p>The project seemed to be sailing along, even winning the commitment of a federal “Small Starts” transit expansion grant. But the announcement of federal funding caught the attention of skeptical state legislators and a number of business owners along the transit corridor who were worried about the loss of parking and the elimination of left turn lanes. Seemingly overnight the project was thrown into jeopardy, when a state legislator introduced a bill to deny state funding to bus rapid transit projects. With controversy continuing to swirl around the project, city leaders were hopeful that a public outpouring of support could overwhelm the opposition. But what they found were neighborhoods—particularly communities of color in north and south Nashville that weren’t served by the Amp—had never understood that the transit project was part of a larger regional transit vision. They asked the age-old question, “What’s in it for us?” and didn’t see a compelling answer.</p>

<p>Without a strong grassroots presence that he could count on, Mayor Dean withdrew his support for the project—effectively shelving the Amp and forcing planners back to the drawing board.  It was a serious setback.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--strong""> <p>a</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>But Nashville didn’t give up. Instead, the City and key partners launched several new initiatives to more deeply engage the public and to cultivate broader support for public transportation.  Nashville’s transit agency kicked off a new strategic planning effort, asking riders and other residents to weigh in on what improvements to transit service they wanted to see. The Nashville Chamber of Commerce launched a new “<a href=""http://www.nashvillechamber.com/homepage/AboutUs/ChamberInitiatives/moving-forward"">Moving Forward</a>” initiative to organize stronger and deeper support from the business community for robust public transit investments. And in South Nashville, home to booming populations of Latinos and recent immigrants, a social service agency called <a href=""http://www.conexionamericas.org"">Conexión Américas</a> hired a new community organizer to engage residents in a bottom-up planning process to help reimagine the busy Nolensville Pike that cuts through the heart of their community. </p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--to""> <p>opposed</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>As opposed to the grandiose vision of the “Amp,” Conexión Américas started small and from the ground up. In August 2014, a new daycare center was about to open as part of Conexión’s “Casa Azafrán”—the site that serves as the group’s headquarters and a community center on Nolensville Pike, just a few miles south of downtown. Conexión Américas’ executive director, Renata Soto, saw a major missing piece of their plan. Because an influx of families would need to drop off their kids at the daycare, employees based at Casa Azafrán would need to park on the other side of Nolensville Pike across from the community center. But there was no crosswalk to get them from one side of the street to the other. Conexión staff worked diligently with Nashville’s public works department, the Nashville MPO, the Tennessee Department Transportation, and T4A to advocate for a safe and visible crosswalk. In just a few short months, by the opening day of the daycare center, Conexión had won not only a crosswalk, but the first bilingual crosswalk in the state of Tennessee, with signs and audible signals in both English and Spanish.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--small""> <p>a</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>With a small but remarkably visible victory under its belt, Conexión then set its sights on engaging the community in a broader vision for transforming Nolensville Pike. With the support of T4A, a grant from The Kresge Foundation, and a partnership with Nashville’s Civic Design Center, Conexión Américas’ community organizer started an intensive outreach campaign to the small businesses and residents along an important section of Nolensville Pike to ask them what they envisioned for the future of the corridor. The meetings were dubbed “Creative Labs,” and it turned out people had a lot to say. Several themes emerged, including: safer streets; wide sidewalks; bicycle paths and more green space; faster and more frequent bus service; art and murals that tell the story of the community; and a new school designed specifically for a new wave of immigrant students.</p>

<p>Meeting people on their schedules, in their businesses and community spaces, proved time consuming, but incredibly fruitful. Residents starting offering ideas and insights into the bus service for the corridor, engagement that eventually helped shape a new rapid transit schedule that was unveiled in February 2016. Many of the immigrant-run small businesses, in an area the city has dubbed its “International District,” wanted help advertising their services and restaurants to a broader population beyond the corridor. Conexión also employed local artists to be part of this civic engagement process, using creative and visual techniques to engage residents at larger community meetings to discuss the future of the Pike. Those artists are now helping develop a new map of the corridor that shows everyone—residents and newcomers alike—where key businesses are located and how they can get there with the new rapid bus service.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--employed""> <p>also</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Most importantly, the residents of south Nashville are now more deeply engaged in charting the future of their community than ever before. This type of grassroots support is going to be critical in other areas of Nashville, as the City now turns to the task of building its next generation of bus rapid transit routes all across the region. Like many regions of the country, transportation funding is limited compared to current needs and future opportunities; and new funding will likely depend on a new voter-approved transportation tax—something that will most certainly require both business leadership and local community support to pass.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lots of public meetings don’t always translate into deep public support.</strong> In Nashville’s case, despite significant early outreach by public agencies, those initial efforts failed to generate deep or vocal enough public and grassroots support for the project. As a result, when opposition to the Amp bus rapid transit project surfaced, opponents quickly gained the upper hand.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The arts have a real potential to spark more creative and genuine civic engagement.</strong> As a former transportation planner, I know all too well how difficult it can be for transportation agencies to effectively engage the public and win their buy-in for new ideas, projects, and funding. But adding the arts, artists, and creativity into the mix can open new doors into the community. For example, Conexión Américas is undertaking an oral history project in which immigrant youth are interviewing long-time Nashville residents in order to spark a dialogue. Such creative engagement efforts can be a powerful. They can also strengthen cross-generational relationships and understanding that can lead to further conversations about a community’s future and the transportation network that will serve its people best.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>When it comes to mass transit, beware of the single, signature project.</strong> Despite a regional plan and long-term vision for a regional transit system across the Nashville region, neighborhoods around Nashville saw only resources and attention flowing to one rapid transit corridor (the Amp), without a sense that it would benefit them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Small victories mean a lot and often fuel longer lasting movements.</strong> For Conexión Américas, winning the new bilingual crosswalk in a matter of months was critical for the community in south Nashville to get a taste of success. This, in turn, has led to its continued involvement in even more ambitious and far-reaching plans to re-envision and improve the Nolensville Pike corridor.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Nashville has long been a region of creative thinkers and doers. It is now building on that history and tapping into the energy of its residents, from long-time Nashvillians to its newest immigrants, to help create safer streets, vibrant neighborhoods, a 21st-century public transit system, and a prosperous economy that works for everyone.</p>

243,Unpacking a successful high school design approach—Linked Learning,<p>Senior Program Officer for Education Jenny Curtin offers a recap of a recent Barr-sponsored webinar on the topic of Linked Learning (recording included).</p>,"<p>In March of this year, Barr’s Education Program announced <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/education-regional"">new strategies</a> for advancing a new vision of secondary education in New England. As part of this work, and as an extension of the Foundation’s commitment to learning in partnership with others, from time to time we will sponsor opportunities for stakeholders across our region to explore new ideas together. One example came earlier this week—a webinar on the topic of Linked Learning.</p>

<p>Why did we choose this topic? Across New England a growing number of districts are seeking knowledge or gaining experience with approaches that advance student success in high school and preparation for college and career. And several leaders in our region have expressed interest in knowing more about Linked Learning.</p>

<p>Linked Learning is a successful approach to education that is based on the idea that students work harder and dream bigger if their education is relevant to them. It integrates multiple components, including rigorous academics that meet college-ready standards with quality career-technical education. Linked Learning is a large-scale, innovative high school approach being implemented in a growing number of urban, suburban, and rural communities in California and other states across the country.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--is""> <p>Learning</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>This webinar covered an overview of Linked Learning’s four core components, as well as evaluation data that speaks to the effectiveness of the approach and critical on-the-ground perspectives from educational leaders who are implementing Linked Learning in their communities. The information was presented by a fantastic panel:</p>

<ul>
<li>Paul Hirsch, principal of the <a href=""http://www.stemweb.org"">STEM Academy of Hollywood</a></li>
<li>Gary Hoachlander, president of <a href=""http://www.connectedcalifornia.org"">ConnectEd: The California Center for College and Career</a> </li>

242,New Films and Next Steps for Barr’s Global Team,"<p>Director of Global Programs Heiner Baumann introduces four new short films highlighting work from Uganda, Malawi, Kenya, and Haiti. He also shares about next steps for himself and the Barr Global team.</p>","<p>Since <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/an-update-on-barr-s-global-program"">my last update</a>, Barr’s Global team has continued the careful work, in partnership with our grantees, of ensuring a thoughtful conclusion and transition of efforts initiated with support from the Foundation since 2010. As one piece of this process, we have documented the outstanding work of some of our grantees to introduce them to colleagues who may benefit from their approaches and who may even be in a position to support them going forward.</p>

<p>I am excited to share with you today four new examples in the form of short films.  Each film poses a question and invites viewers to explore the inspiring answers provided by our partners.</p>

<p>The first film brings us to Malawi and asks the question, “Is there a scalable way to get effective, affordable health care to rural Africa?” <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/partners/d-tree-international""><strong>D-tree International</strong></a> is doing amazing work to arm frontline health workers with effective diagnostic tools. By using mobile technology, D-tree’s rural health workers produce correct patient diagnoses more than 80% of the time. D-tree is one of the standout organizations with evidence to show that their work really does make a difference and results in improved health outcomes.</p>

<p>In the next film we travel to Kenya and consider the question, “Is there a sustainable, scalable way for Africa to meet its growing demand for wood?” We then meet <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/partners/komaza""><strong>KOMAZA</strong></a> and get a glimpse of the incredible work it is doing to partner with farmers to plant and maintain small-scale, income-generating tree farms. By partnering with KOMAZA, farmers make their lands more productive and more resilient to the impacts of climate change. Many participants experience a tripling of earnings from each acre of land.</p>

<p>A third film brings us to rural Ethiopia, where the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/partners/relief-society-of-tigray-rest""><strong>Relief Society of Tigray (REST)</strong></a> embraces the question, “What difference can a locally run organization make?“ It works in an arid, eroded, climate-vulnerable region where sustaining life without overusing lands is a daunting challenge. Yet, with its team of 1,000 Ethiopians, REST has already reached more than two million people with effective programs for diversifying farm and household food production and incomes, while restoring watersheds and promoting the sustainable usage of natural resources.

<p>Lastly, we travel to Haiti, where we face the question, “Is there a sustainable way for Haitians to manage dwindling natural resources like fisheries and mangrove forests?” We meet <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/partners/foprobim""><strong>FoProBiM</strong></a>, one of Haiti’s oldest environmental organizations, that is tackling these difficult issues head-on. Its efforts focus on conserving and restoring the coastal and marine ecosystems as well as improving the livelihoods of the communities that depend on them.</p>

<p><a href=""http://carbonrootsinternational.com/""><strong>Carbon Roots International</strong></a>, a US based nonprofit supporting a for-profit social business in Haiti, is also addressing deforestation in Haiti. To reduce the demand for cooking charcoal, the organization produces green charcoal from the leftovers of sugarcane processing called “bagasse.”</p>

<p>Though seeing these partners on film certainly pales against the experience of visiting and meeting face-to-face with these leaders and their beneficiaries, we hope to shed light on some truly inspiring partners that we have been privileged to support, and whose work continues. We encourage you to watch, to share with your networks, and to contact any of these organizations to learn more.</p>

<p>It has been an extraordinary privilege to be part of such meaningful and urgent work these last five-plus years and we hope you will stay in touch. As Barr Global reaches its formal end-point on June 30, I am pleased to share about next steps for our team. Pierre Imbert will continue working in Haiti with efforts to establish a Haiti-focused fund, called “Give2HaitiFund,” in partnership with The Miami Foundation. I will be joining the newly formed <a href=""http://www.precisionag.org"">Precision Agriculture for Development</a> as managing director, and look forward to advancing the organization’s mission to provide mobile-based advisory services to smallholder farmers in Africa and India. Lastly, <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/bios/emily-sidla"">Emily Sidla</a> will remain on Barr staff to provide continuing support to Global partner organizations and to work with Barr’s Climate team.</p>"
241,Three Calls to Action for the Next Chapter of Boston Creates,<p>Jim Canales shares remarks at the launch of Boston’s cultural plan.</p>,"<p><em>Friday, June 17, marked the official launch of Boston Creates, Boston’s citywide cultural plan. To celebrate this milestone, Barr President Jim Canales joined Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh, Boston Chief of Arts and Culture Julie Burros, Boston Foundation President Paul Grogan, and violinist and composer Shaw Pong Liu for a press announcement at the Sheraton Hotel in Boston. The event was attended by hundreds of area arts enthusiasts and leaders. Jim’s remarks are below:</em></p>

<hr>

<p>Thank you, Mayor Walsh. You have been generous with your expressions of gratitude. But we all know that, without your fervent dedication to the arts, we would not have reached this pivotal moment.</p>

<p>So, on behalf of all us, thank you for your leadership.</p>

<p>I returned last night from Northern Europe, where I spent much of this week on a study tour on clean energy and climate resilience. I mention this because, for all that we learned on those important topics, one of the more captivating things we saw was a piece of public art outside City Hall in Copenhagen.</p>

<p>It was a large bronze sculpture of a polar bear, suspended 15 feet in the air, resting upon an oil pipeline, which was bent in the shape of an upward curve to represent the drastic increase in CO2 emissions since the 1850s. It also turns out that the sculpture, entitled “Unbearable,” was financed by a crowdfunding campaign in advance of the recent climate talks in Paris.</p>

<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" data-lang=""en""><p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr"">The result of a crowdfunding campaign, compelling public art sculpture about climate change: <a href=""https://t.co/BWB7vyU44J"">https://t.co/BWB7vyU44J</a> <a href=""https://t.co/ju8kSxVtSA"">pic.twitter.com/ju8kSxVtSA</a></p>&mdash; Jim Canales (@jcanales) <a href=""https://twitter.com/jcanales/status/743401935655546880"">June 16, 2016</a></blockquote>

<script async src=""//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script>

<p>I share this story not to make a political statement, but instead to speak to the power of the arts: its power to inspire, to provoke, to force reflection, to engage, and indeed, to create change.</p>

<p>Here in Boston, we have the great fortune of living and working in a city that celebrates creative expression in all of its forms, for all of its residents, and in all of its neighborhoods, as <em>Boston Creates</em> has affirmed.</p>

<p>It has been our enormous privilege at the Barr Foundation, in partnership with The Klarman Family Foundation, to support the <em>Boston Creates</em> planning process. We invested significant resources in this effort so that it could be comprehensive in scope, it could unleash our greatest aspirations, and it could forge a path that takes full advantage of the moment before us.</p>

<p>Today, as we formally launch <em>Boston Creates</em>, we find ourselves at an important pivot point. Throughout this process, we had a familiar refrain: the creation of a cultural plan is not the end; it instead represents a beginning. All of us engaged in this process knew that if all we got out of it was a plan, we would have squandered a precious opportunity. Instead, we needed to catalyze action and change.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--us""> <p>of</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>So, as we celebrate the completion of this chapter, we also acknowledge that much remains to be done.</p>

<p>The mayor has already outlined a number of steps, in policy and practice and funding, that the City is committing to in order to make tangible the recommendations in the plan. As the mayor noted, this represents a strong start. But it’s just that—a start.</p>

<p>So today is really about the beginning of our next chapter, and a call to action for each of us in three key respects:</p>
<h4>First, today is a call to action that invites all segments of our community to assume an active role in advancing the priorities of this plan.</h4>
<p>One of the tremendous benefits of the robust community engagement process of <em>Boston Creates</em> is that it planted the seeds for new partnerships and collaborations that will enable us to carry this work forward. <em>Boston Creates</em> brought the business community, the philanthropic community, the public sector, and other key partners to the table as allies, stakeholders, participants, and investors in the arts. As this engagement continues and deepens, together, we can make a significant difference.</p>
<h4>Second, today is a call to action for all of us to embrace and own this cultural plan.</h4>
<p><em>Boston Creates</em> is not—and cannot be—merely a plan for City Hall or its Office of Arts and Culture; <em>Boston Creates</em> is Boston’s Cultural Plan. Its success depends on every one of us playing a role—whether through funding, advocacy, partnership and/or leadership. And we must hold each other accountable to the outcomes we seek.</p>
<h4>Finally, today is a call to action to speak to the power of the arts.</h4>
<p>As there continue to be legislative battles about arts funding, and as we sometimes have to argue for the relevance of the arts, we can be very proud of the statement we are making today for Boston: the arts matter.</p>

<p>They are an essential part of the fabric of a vibrant, inclusive, and future-oriented city of the 21st century. Boston can lead the way, and we can be very proud of the aspirations that this plan sets for our city, of the care and inclusion that our planning process represents, and of the value we have placed upon the arts.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--are""> <p>arts</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Within the hour, Mayor Walsh will welcome over a thousand attendees of the Americans for the Arts national convention, opening in Boston today. What a powerful message we are sending to this gathering of arts leaders from all over the country about the critical role the arts play here in Boston.</p>

<p>Now it is time for all of us to embrace the civic responsibility this plan invites and to actively engage to ensure that the arts, culture, and creativity thrive in our city. You can rest assured that the Barr Foundation will remain deeply engaged as well.</p>

<p>I am delighted to turn the podium now to my friend and colleague, Paul Grogan, president and CEO of The Boston Foundation, who will share some exciting news about a new opportunity for many to step forward to help advance <em>Boston Creates</em>. Thank you.</p>

239,"Important Role for Local, Regional Foundations in Global Climate Change",<p>Foundations focused on climate change should think global and fund local.</p>,"<p>Earlier this month, Jim Canales, president of the Barr Foundation and Kate Wolford, president of The McKnight Foundation in Minneapolis, co-authored an op-ed for <em>The Chronicle of Philanthropy.</em> Barr and McKnight are two of the nation’s largest funders of local and regional climate efforts, and Jim’s and Kate’s piece, <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/chronicle-of-philanthropy-fighting-global-climate-change-requires-foundations-to-give-local"">“Fighting Global Climate Change Requires Foundations to Give Local,”</a> builds a case for how, even though climate is a global challenge, local and regional action is vital—and how foundations of any size can contribute in important ways.</p>

<p>They discuss three tools available to any funder that wants to make a difference advancing local solutions that can have broader impact: convening partners, communications and framing, and making solutions tangible. And they point to examples from their own and others’ experiences. To find out more about these tools and the examples from around the country, I encourage you to read the article and share it with your networks.</p>

<p>What Jim and Kate describe is already happening in many places across our region, with potential for even greater progress and impact if more funders engage. Let me point to just a few examples.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--is""> though <a class=""Pullquote-cta"" href=""https://twitter.com/intent/tweet/?dnt=true&amp;text=climate""> <svg width=""48"" height=""48"" viewBox=""628 -718 2048 2048"" class=""Icon"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg""> <path d=""M2417.2-86.6c1.2,17,1.2,33.9,1.2,50.9c0,517.3-393.8,1113.4-1113.4,1113.4c-221.7,0-427.7-64.2-601-175.7 c31.5,3.6,61.8,4.8,94.5,4.8c183,0,351.4-61.8,485.8-167.2c-172-3.6-316.2-116.3-365.9-271.4c24.2,3.6,48.5,6.1,73.9,6.1 c35.1,0,70.3-4.8,103-13.3C916.1,424.7,781.6,267.2,781.6,76.9c0-1.2,0-3.6,0-4.8c52.1,29.1,112.7,47.2,176.9,49.7 C853.1,51.5,784-68.4,784-204.2c0-72.7,19.4-139.3,53.3-197.5C1030-164.2,1319.6-9.1,1644.3,7.9c-6.1-29.1-9.7-59.4-9.7-89.7 c0-215.7,174.5-391.3,391.3-391.3c112.7,0,214.4,47.2,285.9,123.6c88.4-17,173.3-49.7,248.4-94.5c-29.1,90.9-90.9,167.2-172,215.7 c78.7-8.5,155.1-30.3,225.3-60.6C2560.2-211.4,2493.6-142.4,2417.2-86.6z""/> </svg> Tweet This </a> </blockquote></p>

<p>In 2013, at a time when concerns over the region’s deteriorating public transit, roads, and bridges were coming to a head, The Boston Foundation commissioned a study called <em><a href=""http://abettercity.org/docs/The%20Cost%20of%20Doing%20Nothing%20Final%20with%20TOC.pdf"">The Cost of Doing Nothing</a></em>. The study, done in collaboration with A Better City and the Massachusetts Competitive Partnership, revealed the economic impacts if the state failed to invest in the transportation infrastructure. A follow-up to the report on the benefits of smart, strategic, long-term investment will be completed in late 2016. Investing in public transportation is a critical lever to reduce carbon emissions and these studies play a vital role in framing and communicating about the key challenges and opportunities in ways that resonate with a range of audiences.</p>

<p>To make clean energy solutions tangible, the High Meadows Fund has been working on the creation of highly energy-efficient homes to be located in Vermont mobile home parks. This effort was a response to the large number of mobile homes damaged during Tropical Storm Irene. In collaboration with Efficiency Vermont and the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board, the High Meadows Fund launched a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1SeKQw9Oh4"">mobile home replacement program</a> that developed and tested highly efficient modular homes. The pilot was successful and these High Performance Modular Homes, such as those manufactured by VerMod, are in production and support several inter-related goals: reducing the energy use (and costs) for low-income homeowners, while also extending the benefits of energy efficiency and renewable energy to a segment of the population often underserved by clean energy innovation. These local solutions are also having broader impact. Based on the success of this effort to date, other states like Alaska, Delaware, New Hampshire, and Oregon are launching similar modular home market transformation initiatives.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--solutions""> <p>local</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>An example of effective convening comes from the Henry P. Kendall Foundation, which aims to build support for a bold vision for a resilient, healthy, sustainably produced food system in New England. Starting in 2012, Kendall helped to launch the <a href=""http://www.foodsolutionsne.org"">Food Solutions New England (FSNE)</a> network, which has convened hundreds of people—academics, small and large business owners, elected leaders, residents, and many others—who care about New England and its sustainable agriculture and local food systems. Over the last three years, a cadre of leaders emerged to give shape to a bold, shared vision for how New England can be substantially food-self-reliant, producing as much as 50% of the food we eat by 2060. Not only is the vision becoming widely shared, but the convening done by FSNE has built a growing network of food systems leaders from across the region who are collaborating to bring the vision to life.</p>

<p>There are also even more tools than just the three Canales and Wolford focused on in their piece, such as mobilizing and advocacy. The John Merck Fund has invested in making New England the first coal-free region in the country by supporting coalitions that include the active involvement of local residents and the environmental justice community working in coordination with local and regional environmental organizations. Their strategy has been very successful: four of the region’s seven coal plants have been shut down and three more are set to retire.  But the campaigns don’t stop there. As coal plants are decommissioned, the Fund’s grantees remain engaged, advocating for smart redevelopment, including clean energy.</p>

<p>These are just a few of the examples of terrific work being done in New England to address climate change. It is by no means a complete list and I invite readers to suggest others in the comments section below.</p>

<p>COP 21 in Paris set the stage for nations around the globe to take aggressive actions that could begin to avert the most devastating effects of climate change. For those ambitious goals to take root, cities, states, and regions must continue to lead—and there are numerous constructive roles philanthropy can play.</p>

238,"Charting a Course to Universal, High-Quality Pre-K",<p>A capstone investment building on more than a decade of progress for Boston’s youngest students.</p>,"<p>First the good news: 90% of Boston’s 6,000 four-year-olds are already enrolled in early education and care programs. That was among the key findings of a <a href=""http://www.cityofboston.gov/images_documents/Boston%20UPK%20Advisory%20Committee%20Report%20April%202016%20FINAL_tcm3-53557.pdf"">recent report</a> by a 30-member Advisory Committee on Universal Pre-K, which was appointed by Mayor Martin J. Walsh in May 2014 (and on which I served). Now comes the challenge: with some pre-K students in the Boston Public Schools, some in Head Start or community-based centers, some in charter or parochial schools, some in family childcare settings, how do we ensure all programs meet a consistent and high standard of quality?</p>

<p>Given this challenge, I am excited to share that Barr’s trustees recently approved a $1,400,000 grant to <a href=""http://unitedwaymassbay.org"">United Way of Massachusetts Bay, Inc.</a> This grant is intended to help the City of Boston chart a course to universal, high-quality pre-K. In collaboration with Parthenon-EY and the Wellesley Centers for Women, Boston will complete a supply and demand analysis of existing seats, a quality assessment by program type, and a cost assessment by program type. This data base (along with additional research into lessons learned from comparable initiatives across the country) will then inform the design of an implementation plan to scale universal quality for pre-K across the city.</p>

<p>In March, we <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/new-strategies-for-barr-s-education-program"">announced new strategies for the Foundation’s Education Program</a>, aligned to a singular goal of connecting all students to success in and beyond high school. One implication of this new, sharper focus is that we will wind down Barr’s early education portfolio. Yet we are committed to dedicating the time and resources to bringing this body of work to a thoughtful conclusion—and to ensuring that those partners we have been so proud to support and work with are well positioned to continue to fulfill their missions.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--committed""> <p>are</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>In that context, we are truly excited to be able to make this grant, which builds on more than $30 million invested in early childhood education in the last 10 years. During these years, our partners have had many notable accomplishments—to mention just a few:</p>

<ul>
<li>Boston Public Schools establishing and growing the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/building-on-whats-working-in-early-education-in-boston"">most effective public preschool program in the country</a>; </li>
<li>Children’s Investment Fund producing research that the State Legislature considered when it passed a bond bill providing up to $45 million to improve the quality of program facilities;</li>
<li>First Teacher’s launch of a promising, evidence-based, parent-to-parent school readiness program that helps families support their children’s development of language, literacy, and executive function; and</li>
<li>Strategies for Children, Bessie Tartt Wilson Initiative for Children, and others collectively supporting the health and increasing effectiveness of the early childhood community on which Boston families rely. </li>
</ul>

<p>There are certainly many more important efforts that come to mind, and I invite colleagues to note them in the comment section below. In the months to come we’ll also be working to document and share reflections and lessons learned from these and other early childhood efforts in Boston and Massachusetts over the last decade.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--context""> <p>that</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>The early childhood field has come a long way. While much more remains to be done, Boston has been a forerunner in many ways. And we are excited about the potential of this planning effort to set the stage for Boston to extend its leadership, build on its successes, and develop a strategic pathway to providing high-quality pre-K so that it can fulfill its commitment to the city’s children.</p>"
237,Transforming What it Means to be Green in Affordable Housing,<p>Deploying energy solutions so all Massachusetts residents benefit from a clean energy economy.</p>,"<p>Earlier this spring, the Local Initiatives Support Corporation’s (LISC) <a href=""http://www.bostonlisc.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=534&Itemid=101"">Massachusetts Green Retrofit Initiative</a> reached a milestone as 10 of our 20 multifamily affordable housing partners signed onto the <a href=""http://betterbuildingssolutioncenter.energy.gov"">Better Buildings Challenge (BBC)</a>. Started by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, the BBC provides ongoing technical expertise and support for building owners who commit to a 20% portfolio-wide energy reduction over 10 years. Combined, our 10 leaders own and operate over 22,000 units of housing across Massachusetts, and are transforming what it means to be green for the rest of the affordable housing sector. </p>

<p>But how did we get here? Thanks to the support of the Barr Foundation, more than six years ago LISC created the Green Retrofit Initiative, a program with a goal to accelerate Massachusetts’ multifamily affordable housing owners toward an efficient, clean-energy future. Through this initiative, LISC connected owners to energy efficiency and renewable energy funding options and provided them with technical expertise. Our building science partner, New Ecology, Inc., helped owners analyze their housing portfolios’ baseline energy use, and develop and implement strategic plans to accomplish their desired energy savings goals.</p>

<p>The results have been impressive. Through the Initiative, owners have successfully navigated Massachusetts’ complex utility programs to realize consistent and predictable energy efficiency improvements. From 2012 to 2015, participants experienced average savings of 29% for electric projects and 23% for gas projects. Overall, we have worked with 50 multifamily affordable housing owners across the state to benchmark 17,000 units, retrofit more than 5,000 units, and leverage more than $17 million in financing.</p>

<p>The experiences of participating building owners have also informed LISC’s work to inform smart policies for energy efficiency and renewable technologies for low- and moderate- income housing. We believe that the golden moment to achieve deeper energy efficiency savings and to incorporate long-lasting clean energy technologies is when an affordable housing project is slated for a substantial rehabilitation. This happens only every 15 to 20 years. So, the critical policy question is, how can we make sure it’s easier for affordable housing owners to pursue deeper energy efficiency savings and clean-energy technologies during this window of opportunity?</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--the""> <p>believe</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Our current work is dedicated to answering this question. We believe the first step is for owners to know exactly which efficiency and clean energy measures will work best for them and their specific projects. This requires comprehensive energy audits in the design process to illuminate what is possible. The second step is to collaborate with the state’s housing finance agencies, utilities, and other partners to make sure that, once owners know the best options for them, they will have a predictable source of funding to implement those deeper efficiency and clean energy measures. </p>

<p>LISC applauds all its Green Retrofit Initiative owners for their leadership and efforts in greening the affordable housing sector across the state. We look forward to continuing this work—supporting owners on the ground, while also ensuring that policy discussions are informed by their stories and experiences, so that all Massachusetts residents benefit from a clean energy economy.</p>

236,Fighting Global Climate Change Requires Foundations to Give Local,"<p>Jim Canales and Kate Wolford, president of The McKnight Foundation, call attention to three tools available to any local or regional grant maker ready to join the fight on climate change.</p>","<p>Climate change is one of the most urgent challenges of our time—so pressing it brought nearly 170 nations together this spring to sign a landmark agreement. While the scale of this challenge is global, we believe that foundations of all types and sizes can help address it and that there are distinct and important roles for organizations like ours that focus on the city, state, or regional levels.</p>

<p>Our two institutions, the Barr Foundation and The McKnight Foundation, have devoted a substantial portion of our resources to slowing climate change.</p>

<p>We believe that philanthropy can help catalyze breakthroughs and advance local solutions and leadership in ways that will spur broader action. It is because of the immense potential of this kind of local leadership that, after issuing his encyclical on climate, Pope Francis convened the largest-ever gathering of mayors at the Vatican and why over 500 mayors were present for the climate talks in Paris.</p>

<p>Protecting the planet requires urgent action from everyone in philanthropy. And there is much that each of us can do, no matter the scale of our missions or endowments and whether we are private, family, or community foundations. Even foundations that do not make grants in areas that have anything to do with climate change can invest their endowments and approach their grant making in climate-smart ways.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--much""> <p>is</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>Reflecting on the various approaches we have taken at Barr and McKnight, and on leading examples from a growing collection of other foundations bringing their energy, talents, and resources to this work, we want to call attention to three tools available to any local or regional grant maker ready to join this critical work.</p>

<h3>Gather key players to collaborate.</h3>
<p>Climate change touches everyone in our communities. And local foundations are in a unique position to bring together everyone who has a role to devise potential solutions and advance change. The <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/partners/green-ribbon-commission"">Green Ribbon Commission</a> in Boston is one example. Supported by Barr and a group of eight local grant makers, the commission gathers business and civic leaders to advise the city on achieving its climate goals. They are also showing impressive leadership in their own fields and in important policy discussions related to energy, transportation, and climate preparedness.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.betterenergy.org/projects/e21-initiative"">Great Plains Institute’s e21 initiative</a>, funded by McKnight, is another example that is drawing national attention. Bringing together Minnesota utility companies, business organizations, civil-society representatives, and low-income consumer experts, e21 is reinventing the utility business model and the regulations that guide it.</p>

<p>In a similar fashion, the <a href=""https://www.sdfoundation.org"">San Diego Foundation</a> played a catalytic regional role in engaging local cities and public agencies to take a more comprehensive approach to climate change—now evidenced by one of the nation’s most ambitious climate plans, with a goal of reducing emissions by 50 percent and reaching 100 percent renewable energy within two decades.</p>
<h3>Communicate and inspire action.</h3>
<p>In addition to its grant-making resources, a foundation’s reputation and voice are critical assets that can be deployed in important ways. Through strategic communications, foundations can elevate the importance of climate action, spotlight effective and promising approaches, call attention to key issues that need attention, or advance inspiring visions to rally action.</p>

<p>One example is what the Bullitt Foundation has done with its <a href=""http://www.bullitt.org/2016/01/18/new-program-changes-at-the-bullitt-foundation/"">“Emerald Corridor” initiative</a>, casting a vision for Seattle, Portland, and Vancouver to become “leapfrog cities … raising the bar for the planet by demonstrating what is possible.”</p>

<p>To inform thoughtful dialogue and encourage everyone to make decisions based on data, foundations can also sponsor polling and objective research—as Barr did in 2015 with a grant for an independent analysis of the future energy needs of Massachusetts and the cost and effect on climate of various strategies for reliably meeting demand over time.</p>

<p>Because of a grant from ­McKnight, Minnesota Public Radio is one of the few major media outlets in the country with a reporter dedicated full time to climate coverage. The station brings careful reporting on local effects and potential solutions to a broad, engaged audience and ensures the issue is front and center in public conversations.</p>
<h3>Make solutions tangible.</h3>
<p>Local and regional foundations can also play an important role in helping make solutions concrete. With the passage of critical legislation in 2013, Minnesota is on the vanguard of using community solar gardens, in which electricity users purchase shares in large solar arrays.</p>

<p>For 15 years, a local organization, the <a href=""http://www.rreal.org"">Rural Renewable Energy Alliance</a>, has pioneered the use of solar energy to address the needs of low-income people in rural communities throughout Minnesota who lack sufficient fuel. With support from McKnight, the alliance is testing a new approach in which families on the federal energy-assistance program can get their power from solar instead of fossil fuels.</p>

<p>Another concept philanthropy is helping make more tangible is Bus Rapid Transit. Intrigued by its effectiveness in other countries, and its potential to reduce emissions and better link communities to economic opportunities, the <a href=""https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org"">Rockefeller Foundation</a> developed a strategy to support Bus Rapid Transit explorations in cities across the United States.</p>

<p>Their funding jump-started the conversation. Then local grant makers—including Barr—stepped up, in partnership with Rockefeller, to advance it in Boston, Nashville, Pittsburgh, and Montgomery County, Md.</p>

<p>Foundations can also inject timely capacity into municipal governments to take on visionary work and to attract additional resources. While federal action is limited, local governments have repeatedly shown that they have the will to act and that they have tools that can help reduce the dangerous emissions that warm the planet.</p>

<p>Local governments can be a proving ground for efforts that can be copied at a state level, and local projects often help to educate, organize, and galvanize stakeholders to push for changes on a larger scale.</p>

<p>Both Barr and McKnight have experience supporting local work through direct support to municipal governments. Barr made a <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/new-report-positions-boston-for-next-wave-of-energy-solutions"">challenge grant to the City of Boston</a> to pay part of the salary for someone in a new role to focus exclusively on community energy solutions. This modest investment ultimately attracted a wide range of additional resources that will drive progress on clean energy. Similarly, ­McKnight collaborated with the <a href=""http://www.ef.org"">Energy Foundation</a> to support efforts in Minneapolis to drive energy-efficiency improvements in large commercial buildings as part of the city’s innovative energy-transparency ordinance.</p>

<p>Some challenges are so immense that nobody wants to take them on. Climate change may seem to be one of those, considering its scale, the vast range of solutions needed, and the political obstacles we witness at the national level. Indeed, federal gridlock underscores the potential and value of local and regional action — action that sparks progress, progress that points to success, and success that breeds more success.</p>

<p>If local philanthropy can get this momentum building in all the places we care about, and where our engagement matters, we may well contribute to a new narrative—that meeting the challenge of climate change, while ambitious, is absolutely possible. </p>

235,Creating Connection through Arts and Creativity ,<p>A national movement to build public support for the arts comes to Massachusetts.</p>,"<p>One of the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/arts-creativity"">new strategies</a> for Barr’s Arts program is activating public support for arts and creativity.  <a href=""http://www.creatingconnection.org"">Creating Connection</a> is a national effort focused on doing just that. Led by <a href=""http://www.artsmidwest.org/"">Arts Midwest</a> and the <a href=""http://www.metgroup.com"">Metropolitan Group</a>, the movement extended its reach to Massachusetts—with <a href=""http://www.eventbrite.com/o/hosted-by-the-barr-foundation-bloomberg-philanthropies-arts-midwest-and-the-metropolitan-group-10719256201"">two free, public workshops</a> hosted in early June. </p>

<p>Creating Connection aims to provide arts organizations, artists, and art supporters with data-driven, pro-arts messages to apply to their work.  We have been following this initiative and, in partnership with Bloomberg Philanthropies, were able to bring it to Massachusetts. The workshop discussions focused on how to apply methods from this research in order to connect with broad and diverse audiences. </p>

<p>To provide more background on what it means to “build public will,” I asked David Fraher, president and CEO of Arts Midwest, to reflect on the work thus far. Below is an excerpt from our conversation.</p>
<h3>What is Creating Connection?</h3>
<p>Creating Connection is a national movement to build public will for the arts through change-focused communications campaigns. By building public will, we aim to shift people’s attitudes so that they take new or different actions. Collectively these actions will make lasting change in the way arts and culture are recognized, valued, and a part of everyday life.</p>
<h3>What got it started?</h3>
<p>The initiative grew out of long-term frustration from the arts community. Arts organizations are often the first to lose their funding, particularly from the public sector, and the last to get their funding restored. The arts are in a place of easy expendability, a nicety rather than a necessity.</p>

<p>Arts organizations have tried to reposition themselves in ways they thought would help validate the arts to the public.  Oftentimes they were successful, but only in one-off cases or pieces of legislation.  The arts community was continually motivating the same people—people who were already believers. We needed to widen the circle, and we didn’t know how.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--community""> <p>arts</p> </blockquote></p>
<h3>How can building public will change the status quo?</h3>
<p>The communications framework and underlying principles for public will building turned everything we were doing on its head.  Instead of starting in the same spot: <em>“We are the arts, look how we’re benefiting [insert cause here]”</em>…it challenged us to start with, <em>“What does the public value? Where are families placing their priorities?”</em>  We then could ground our cause in the existing values of those families, which were driving their decisions. </p>

<p>Public will building recognizes that it is unreasonable to try to change people’s values and focuses instead on identifying and understanding how existing values can serve as links to an issue.  Once we learned more about it, we realized, wow, this is how you really connect with people. </p>

<h3>Can you give an example where building public will really paid off?</h3>
<p>One area where building public will was successfully deployed is around public libraries. In the last 10 to 15 years, the way people perceive and use public libraries has really changed. Libraries are no longer dusty, quiet depositories for books. They have become more vibrant and engaging. Why? This change happened because someone realized that what people really valued was a place of opportunity in their community. A library had the potential to be seen by the community as that place. </p>

<p>So, libraries were responsive and changed what they provided and how they provided it.  Now people go to the library to access the internet and to apply for jobs.  Librarians run community programs and interact with people more often than they interact with books.  That process—from identifying the problem to discovering that libraries could have a different future—took about eight years.  Some public will efforts can move a little more quickly, but eight years is about the typical timeframe needed to create lasting change.   </p>
<h3>How did you get a pulse on where people are at with the arts, what they value?</h3>
<p>We partnered with the Metropolitan Group on a national research effort to guide our communications strategy and identify groups that could help widen our circle.  Our research consisted of a national survey of 2,000 representative respondents; focus and discussion groups across the country; and one-on-one conversations with community leaders, working artists and others.  From the <a href=""http://static1.squarespace.com/static/56e347ee0442621615c31e5e/t/5715598b27d4bdbf70c7115b/1461018436491/Creating+Connection+Report.pdf"">research findings</a>, we created a messaging framework that we continue to test, tweak, and move forward today.  We are also customizing these messages in different regions of the country where we have local partners like the Barr Foundation.   </p>
<h3>Did any research findings surprise you?</h3>
<p>One surprise was about who we could bring in to widen our circle.  Based on ticket sales and audience engagement, we expected older demographics to be at the center of an effort to build broader support for the arts.  But groups identified through the research as highly likely to engage in a public will effort on behalf of the arts were Millennials, communities of color, and parents of young children. This was an exciting, hopeful discovery—there were pathways to building authentic engagement with these groups.</p>

<p>Another surprise was about how our messages were resonating with people.  A lot of the language that the field has traditionally used to make a case for the arts (improve jobs, grow economy, etc.) did not resonate at all among the broad public.  In fact, people didn’t even believe it.  This finding showed us we needed two different communications strategies: one for building broad public support and another one for targeting policymakers.  All along, we had built arguments to motivate policymakers and then promoted them broadly.  Instead, we needed to speak to the different values of those groups.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--showed""> <p>finding</p> </blockquote>   </p>
<h3>How is this different from marketing or rebranding the arts?</h3>
<p>A public will strategy is different from marketing because it doesn&#39;t require a front-loaded investment for advertising placements or promotional materials.  It’s about creating the messages that people will use through social media and grassroots channels.  You can also easily adjust your public will strategy and messaging based on feedback.  That’s what we’ve been doing with Creating Connection: constantly improving it based on what we learn and tailoring it for specific regions.  </p>
<h3>What insights are you gathering in Massachusetts?</h3>
<p>We’ve taken what we heard across the U.S. and are testing it in Massachusetts.  We conducted a series of in-depth focus groups, in which we talked to residents about how they express themselves creatively and what creativity means in their lives.  We are also getting ready to kick off a polling project in collaboration with MassINC and Lake Research.  The polling is designed to elicit information that will allow us to further understand and segment audiences, and also to create a baseline against which to measure changes in attitudes and behaviors.</p>
<h3>How can your work help arts organizations connect with new or evolving audiences?</h3>
<p>Moving forward with this public will strategy is going to take more than changing the photo and the headline in your brochure.  Arts organizations will need to evolve both their communications and their experiences.  How people want to spend their time and express themselves is changing (and will continue to change).  This is the new normal.  But, this work can help organizations identify their changing audiences and meet those audiences where they are.  Successfully responding to people’s values and preferences will open up pathways to widen our circle and engage new audiences with the arts.</p>

234,When Artists Are at the Intersection of Planning and Community,"<p>How a group of artists infused creativity, imagination, artistry and fun into a citywide planning process.</p>","<p>When we hear the phrase “planning process,” it often conjures images of PowerPoint slides and half-empty high school gymnasiums, where a passionate few deliver prepared remarks, one-at-a-time, at the microphones set up in the aisles. Over a year ago, when Boston launched a year-long process, called <a href=""http://www.bostoncreates.org"">Boston Creates</a>, to enliven and strengthen the arts and creativity, some of us wondered what could be done to inject some creativity, surprise, and fun into the process itself.</p>

<p>As one way to capture how Bostonians think about their city’s creative potential, we enlisted the help of the people on the front lines—Boston’s working artists. <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/meet-the-creatives-behind-boston-creates"">Department of Play, an artist collective</a>, along  with conceptual artist Heather Kapplow, photographer Leonardo March, and musician Shaw Pong Liu, went into different neighborhoods across Boston to explore the ways in which Bostonians encountered arts and culture in their lives and what they thought was necessary to support creative expression. These artists were called “artist-ethnographers” because they were collecting ethnographic data from different social and cultural groups, filtered through their unique artistic practices.</p>

<p>How can artists contribute uniquely to improving the life of a city? Artists traffic in communication and translation, at times, making complex things simple, exposing essential truths about life. Artists can give metaphors and visual representation to the “emotional data” of people’s hopes, fears, and ambitions. Artists can build bridges and connect people across neighborhoods and experiences. Artists think creatively about how to solve problems. They can hear and translate multiple voices into action by pushing conversations forward and bringing together people who may not otherwise meet. The <em>Boston Creates</em> artists were the connective tissue between the sometimes jargon-heavy language of urban planning and the personal experiences of residents that makes a cultural plan necessary and immediate.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--Creates""> <p>Boston</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>To document and learn from the <em>Boston Creates</em> artist-ethnographers, Barr partnered with Technical Development Corporation (TDC) and Hairpin Communications to create a series of videos and essays documenting their work within the cultural planning process. The artists speak about their unconventional methods and show how art can start dialogues and open doors to possible solutions.</p>

<p>The process reflected back how Bostonians view arts and culture in their own neighborhoods—and how much diversity there is in those views. The contributions of artists are multi-fold. This videos series shares the ingenuity and creativity that went into the process of connecting, in the hope that communities will be inspired to continue the dialogue and express their creativity in their daily lives.</p>

<p>I encourage you to watch and read, enjoy and share these with others who believe in the power of arts to engage and inspire dynamic, thriving communities.</p>

231,When Collective Action Works Wonders,<p>Key lessons from a highly successful public-private partnership focused on expanding access to high-quality arts education in Boston.</p>,"<p>In 2008, a group of leaders from the Boston Public Schools (BPS), the Barr Foundation, The Boston Foundation, Hunt Alternatives, The Klarman Family Foundation, the Linde Family Foundation, and EdVestors set their sights on a shared goal of increasing access to quality arts education in Boston. Together they launched a new public-private partnership called the <a href=""http://www.bpsarts.org"">BPS Arts Expansion (BPS-AE)</a>. Fast-forward seven years, and BPS-AE has helped 17,000 more students receive arts education during the school day. It has increased public funding leveraged by private investment. And it has dramatically expanded stakeholder engagement in this collective effort.</p>

<p>The success factors behind this effort were many and complex. They are certainly more clear in the rear view mirror. That is why we captured the story and the lessons learned in a new case study, <a href=""http://www.edvestors.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BPS-Arts-Expansion-Case-Study.pdf""><em>Dancing to the Top: How Collective Action Revitalized Arts Education</em></a>. The case study is intended to help others learn and adapt the strategies we used.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--helped""> <p>has</p> </blockquote>
Here are just three of the many key lessons we learned:</p>
<h3>1. Anchor your work in data. Then set clear goals and outcomes.</h3>
<p>In the earliest days of the planning effort, we made a critical choice to begin by conducting the first-ever comprehensive inventory of the school-based arts instruction students received, which provided a complete picture of arts education in BPS. Armed with data, we set clear and measurable—yet ambitious—goals. These goals were, and still remain, the compass points for all BPS-AE activities. And to drive movement toward these compass points, we monitor, document, and share out our progress toward these goals as a community accountability and engagement strategy.</p>
<h3>2. Don’t count on just one great leader.</h3>
<p>We began this work with a relatively new BPS superintendent, Dr. Carol Johnson, who felt passionately that arts education was essential for every student. However, we made sure the work didn’t rest with one leader. We built a multi-tiered leadership structure including an advisory board of influential civic, philanthropic, business, and nonprofit leaders who had stature, networks, and visibility to lend to the effort. We also engaged in a participatory planning and development process aimed at authentically engaging the people most directly involved in arts education: teachers, community arts organizations, and school leaders. And we sought to bring the voices of students and families to the table throughout the effort. This engendered broad ownership at multiple levels that has sustained the work through three superintendents, two mayors, and dozens of other civic transitions.</p>
<h3>3. Align and leverage philanthropic engagement.</h3>
<p>From our earliest days we had interest from donors, many of whom were already funding youth arts programs. BPS-AE provided a platform for them to come together to impact the system. We co-designed and have continued to execute a collaborative grantmaking program based on incentives to align funded work with BPS-AE goals and desired outcomes. Our lead local collaborative funders—the Barr Foundation, The Boston Foundation, Hunt Alternatives, The Klarman Family Foundation, and the Linde Family Foundation—have been involved both in shaping BPS-AE since its earliest days and in supporting arts programming for students. We were fortunate to attract national funding from The Wallace Foundation, which was aimed at systems change. The complementary nature of these funding streams used strategically is now leveraging a 5-to-1 increase in public funding for in-school arts education.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say, there were more than three key factors to our success (including a focus on communications efforts, such as the new case study). To learn more, we encourage you to read the full case study, which you can download (along with an associated toolkit we created to help guide your efforts) from <a href=""https://www.edvestors.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/BPS-Arts-Expansion-Case-Study.pdf"">our website</a>.</p>

<p>While our efforts and this case study focus on the topic of expanding quality in-school arts instruction, we believe the approach and lessons can apply to many other complex issue areas that depend on collective action to advance change.</p>

230,Stewarding a Boston Treasure,<p>Jim Canales describes Barr’s new work to promote a great public realm along Boston’s waterfront.</p>,"<p>Barr embraces as a <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/about#core-values"">core value</a> the imperative to adopt a long-term perspective. We believe that philanthropic institutions have a unique ability to ensure that today’s decisions are informed by considerations for future generations.</p>

<p>Grounded in this principle, we are excited to announce today a new initiative focused on the Boston waterfront. Put simply, our goal is to promote a great public realm—one that provides exceptional parks and accessible open spaces; engages neighborhoods and their residents; welcomes people of all ages and abilities; incorporates great urban design; enables responsible development; and seamlessly addresses the critical need for resiliency and adaptation to climate change.</p>

<p>This work emanates from explorations we have engaged in over the past several months and from Barr’s mission to serve as both stewards and catalysts. The more deeply we considered the opportunity, the more clearly we recognized a need both to ensure the stewardship of a vital public asset and to help catalyze a comprehensive vision and support sustained action to protect and enhance it over time.</p>

<p>Boston is well recognized for its historic waterfront and harbor; yet, this public treasure is in jeopardy. In the absence of a long-term, comprehensive vision—and robust, well-resourced entities that protect and steward it—Boston’s waterfront has been at the mercy of rapid, and often uncoordinated, parcel-by-parcel development. Moreover, given what we know about climate change and the attendant risks of sea-level rise, we must embrace a long-term view for our waterfront, with special attention given to existing waterfront communities and prospective plans for development along the waterfront’s edge.</p>

<p>We have awarded just over $800,000 in grants during the past few months, in the initial stage of this waterfront initiative. These are motivated by a belief that the development and implementation of a robust, inclusive, and long-term plan for Boston’s waterfront and harbor will require the active engagement and leadership of key partners and other actors with deep roots and credibility in Boston’s waterfront neighborhoods, working with and alongside the City and other government agencies. Barr’s grants to date include:</p>

<ul>
<li>A total of $350,000 to support the formation and first-year activities of <a href=""http://www.bostonharbornow.org"">Boston Harbor Now</a>, an ambitious new entity created by the merger of the Boston Harbor Island Alliance and The Boston Harbor Association (with the latter organization already significantly supported by Barr for its climate-related work).</li>
<li>A $250,000 grant to <a href=""http://www.thetrustees.org"">The Trustees of Reservations</a> to advance waterfront planning it had already begun and to determine the most constructive role it could play, in collaboration with other entities, in shaping a roadmap to achieve a shared waterfront vision.</li>
<li>A $210,000 grant to the <a href=""http://www.bostonredevelopmentauthority.org"">Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA)</a> to carry out visioning and the feasibility phase of a waterfront planning process as part of <em><a href=""http://imagine.boston.gov"">Imagine Boston 2030</a></em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>By working in partnership with the City via the third grant, we seek to animate <em>Imagine Boston 2030</em> goals related to climate adaptation and the waterfront already articulated through public input and research. One part of this work is ensuring that planning for Boston’s waterfront aligns with the findings of the first phase of the City’s <a href=""http://climateready.boston.gov"">Climate Ready Boston</a> project that Barr is supporting through our <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/climate/climate-preparedness"">Climate Preparedness initiative</a>. We recognize that there are also likely to be natural points of alignment with Barr’s <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/arts-creativity"">Arts &amp; Creativity</a> and <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/climate/mobility"">Mobility</a> strategies.</p>

<p>While the majority of Barr’s grantmaking extends from the Foundation’s <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/grantmaking/our-strategies"">core program strategies</a>, from time to time the Foundation will initiate work such as this, consistent with Barr’s mission of service and commitment to the long-term strength, vitality, and resilience of our region. These special initiatives will typically support targeted, time-limited efforts.</p>

<p>We intend to share additional updates as this work unfolds. However Barr’s role evolves, our core commitments remain to embrace a long-term perspective, to engage transparently, and to provide for the enforcement of existing and the development of new city and state mechanisms intended to protect the public interest in the waterfront.</p>

<p>In the end, we aim to enable and facilitate progress toward an ambitious, responsible, and actionable vision for Boston’s rapidly-changing waterfront—one that considers the needs of all Boston residents, embraces a long-term view, and ensures we protect and steward one of Boston’s most treasured assets.</p>

229,Renewable Returns: And the Prize Goes to…,<p>How a small incentive showed it can pay big to invest in renewable energy.</p>,"<p>In the summer of 2014, I read that George Washington University, American University, and The George Washington University Hospital were going to <a href=""http://www.gwhospital.com/community-information/news-room/solar-project-to-bring-energy-to-three-dc-institutions#.Vxq8VcfiOUc"">buy 52 megawatts of power</a> every year from a North Carolina solar farm. At the time, it was the largest non-utility solar power purchase in the U.S. and the largest solar project east of the Mississippi River. The icing on the cake was that they were getting fixed pricing for solar energy for 20 years at a lower price point than the current market.</p>

<p>In Boston, since we have so many colleges, hospitals, and large institutions—all major energy users—I thought, <em>“Could we do something similar here?”</em> The <a href=""http://www.greenribboncommission.org"">Boston Green Ribbon Commission (GRC)</a> also considered this question and last year organized an informal network of Boston institutions to talk about how they could do large-scale renewables procurement. There was a lot of interest in joint purchasing to reduce costs and make it easier, but uncertainty about how it might work. To continue the momentum and to inspire action, the GRC issued a prize and Barr partnered with the GRC to fund it.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.greenribboncommission.org/work/renewable-energy-initiative/renewable-energy-leadership-prize"">The $100,000 Renewable Energy Leadership Prize</a> launched last summer. Its goal was to spur local leaders who were contemplating big renewable energy purchases to move ahead with their projects.</p>

<p>On February 25, the GRC announced the winner: <strong>PowerOptions</strong>, in partnership with <strong>Tufts University</strong> and <strong>Endicott College</strong>. The largest energy-buying consortium in Massachusetts, PowerOptions procures electricity and natural gas supply for 500 nonprofit and public members. The nonprofit organization teamed up with two of its members, Tufts University and Endicott College, to purchase up to 12 megawatts of power from a wind project in New England.</p>

<p>Other applications came from <strong>Boston University</strong> and by <strong>A Better City (ABC)</strong>, a consortium of Boston institutions and civic leaders. All three applicants went through twists and turns to pursue a deal and, as of this writing, their pursuits are still ongoing. Some customers participating in the deals withdrew because developers changed their terms. Some deals fell apart or were delayed as market and policy conditions changed. Most notably, Endicott College is no longer part of the PowerOptions deal because the developer wanted them to purchase a larger amount of power. They were replaced by <strong>Partners HealthCare</strong>, the parent organization of Massachusetts General Hospital and other major healthcare facilities.</p>

<p>At this point, it appears that the Prize is yielding two sets of results. First, it spurred the three applicants to devote considerable time and effort to solving the puzzle of buying offsite renewable electricity. Our initial hope and hypothesis was that a prize would catalyze action, and that turned out to be right. There was a risk that there would be no takers and we were pleasantly surprised to see such significant interest. The applicants were in different stages of readiness and had different factors motivating their actions. The Prize helped push them to their finish lines by creating deadlines for accomplishing what some had been planning to do for some time. If all three deals go ahead as currently planned, it could result in as much as 63 megawatts of new renewable energy capacity.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--helped""> <p>Prize</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>The second result is learning: by the applicants and their developers, consultants, and brokers; by the GRC and their stakeholders; and by the Barr Foundation. To share the lessons learned from the Prize, the GRC recently released a case study, called <em>Solving the Puzzle</em>.</p>

<p class=""tyler"">Read <em>Solving the Puzzle</em><a href=""http://www.greenribboncommission.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GRC-Renewable-Energy-Leadership-Prize-Case-Study-2016.pdf%22%5D"">http://www.greenribboncommission.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GRC-Renewable-Energy-Leadership-Prize-Case-Study-2016.pdf&quot;]</a></p>
<h4>Here are four of the key takeaways:</h4><h4>1. Collaboration takes time, but multiplies returns.</h4>
<p>The Prize placed a high premium on collaborative proposals, with the theory that joint procurement would be better. While this created a barrier to wider participation, it also tested the theory that institutions could collaborate to negotiate stronger green power purchases. While results suggest that more time is needed to structure such deals, it also showed that collaboration did in fact create better deals. I hope the participants’ experiences of crafting and negotiating these deals provides them with jumping-off points to continue their efforts and to inspire others.</p>
<h4>2. Unexpected terms may make the deal work for you.</h4>
<p>All three applicants considered or deployed some complicated features in their deals, including forms of arbitrage for both electricity and renewable energy credits, as well as inter-regional power deals. The complexity was worthwhile because of the significant financial benefits it captured. There were huge price variations between technologies and regions that enabled significant cost savings.</p>
<h4>3. Policies can move or delay an energy deal.</h4>
<p>State, regional, and federal policies had major implications for the nature of the deals. Strong energy policies drive progress in clean energy, but they are difficult to navigate and can be slowed down by legislative inaction. State solar regulations and federal tax credits were both up in the air at the time of the contest, causing a number of delays and potential dead-ends. The applications, and the response from potential suppliers, were affected by this uncertainty.</p>
<h4>4. A commitment to sustainability really matters.</h4>
<p>While all applicants were looking for the most cost competitive deals, their degrees of commitment to sustainability and clean energy played decisive roles in motivating their actions. Those with long-term carbon-reduction goals embedded across their organizational decision-making processes looked at their options in a different light than institutions without such goals.</p>

<p>I would strongly encourage other funders to consider launching a similar initiative. The Prize was particularly useful here in Boston, where higher education, healthcare, and private companies have the potential to directly purchase renewable energy. The Prize motivated them to commit to such purchases. I expect many other places are in similar situations.</p>

<p>There is still work to be done to expand interest in renewable energy purchases and to make it easier for institutions to participate. But, the Prize offered a major learning opportunity for the Barr Foundation and for the GRC in what it takes for institutions and companies to engage in renewable energy purchases.</p>

228,Why You Want an Artist on Your Team,<p>Artists are leveraging their unique talents to transform communities across the U.S. </p>,"<p>Earlier this year, Katarzyna Balug from Department of Play <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/meet-the-creatives-behind-boston-creates"">shared with us</a> how artists have played an important role in Boston’s cultural planning process, <em><a href=""http://www.bostoncreates.org"">Boston Creates</a></em>. In addition to gathering public input through unconventional avenues such as bread-making parties, artists helped ensure that voices were documented, even if it meant printing residents’ brainstorming notes on the surface of a city-owned vehicle.</p>

<p>And Boston is not the only city looking to artists for help engaging residents and thinking creatively about how to solve its most pressing challenges. “When Artists are at the Planning Table” was a key topic of discussion at the recent national summit hosted by <a href=""http://www.artplaceamerica.org"">ArtPlace America</a>.  ArtPlace America, a 10-year initiative to position arts and culture as a core sector in overall community development and planning processes, has been supporting Department of Play’s work in Boston, as well as other inspiring projects across the country. They are also one of <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/partners/artplace-america"">Barr’s first partners</a> in implementing our new <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/arts-creativity"">Arts &amp; Creativity strategy</a> in this emerging field, known as creative placemaking. </p>

<p>I had the opportunity to attend the summit in person and hear from an impressive lineup of artists, city officials, and nonprofit leaders about how creative placemaking is successfully manifesting in cities across the country. Artists are coming to the table to address a wide range of issues, which I learned more about during the next panel, “Artists Engaged in Public Safety, Housing and Public Health.” Below, I share highlights of these discussions, which were written and originally published by ArtPlace America.</p>

<em>The following originally appeared on <a href=""http://www.artplaceamerica.org/blog/closer-look-artplace-summit-artists-table"">ArtPlace America’s blog</a>.</em></p>

<p>As we re-cap this year’s ArtPlace Summit in Phoenix, AZ, we’d be remiss if we didn’t highlight the two most talked about plenary sessions: “Creative Placemaking: When Artists are at the Planning Table” and “Artists Engaged in Public Safety, Housing and Public Health.” In his opening remarks, Jamie Bennett, executive director of ArtPlace America, called the lineup for the former panel “ideal,” saying, “For once in our lives we actually got it. We got the dream team.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t just the breadth and depth of knowledge and passion that came out of these panels that made them so popular with the attendees–each of our panelists shared utterly captivating stories about their work.</p>

<p>The “Creative Placemaking: When Artists are at the Planning Table” session began as most of the plenary sessions did: with each panelist introducing themselves and their work.</p>

<p>Jason Schupbach, director of design programs and visual arts division team leader at the National Endowment for the Arts, got things started by contextualizing creative placemaking within the scope of American history: “It took 100 years to build the public health field. We’re only 50 years into this game.” He insisted planners and developers adjust their vision by recognizing what an asset artists can be to their processes.</p>

<p>“The really special thing about artists and art organizations…is that they’re one of the assets that every single community has,” Jason said. “This is a naturally occurring resource in America… You have to take [them] seriously, just like you’d take a transit consultant seriously. It’s someone who’s going to help you with engagement in a serious way.”</p>

<p>Amanda Lovelee, the city artist for Public Art Saint Paul, is one of the artists actively doing that work in St. Paul, MN. Amanda likened her role in the city to a bee, actively pollinating with her art.</p>

<p>“I’m the bee, and Public Art St. Paul is the hive. Artists gather around the hive and dream and innovate…and then the city of St. Paul is the orchard. As the pollinator, I help make the city bloom and create these really strong reciprocal relationships between the city departments.”</p>

<p>For Amanda, her major role as a creative culture-bearer in St. Paul is to create projects which double as tools for engagement. One of her most successful endeavors, Pop Up Meeting, delivers popsicles via a bright red truck under the guise of inviting residents into community conversations.</p>

<p>“Last summer we held 17 meetings, we handed out 1,826 popsicles in exchange for 1,153 surveys. Each survey was specific to the project and location we went to. Out of that, 70% of the people we surveyed said they had never been to a city meeting before.”</p>

<p>Our final panelist was James Rojas, an urban planner and artist based in Los Angeles, CA. Like Amanda, James has created a unique model for engaging citizens in the development process through what he terms “the visual, spatial and emotional language of cities.”</p>

<p>“Most people can’t read maps and numbers make no sense to them,” James explained. “But they know what a city feels like.”</p>

<p>James asks people to use found objects (hair rollers, popsicle sticks, etc.) to build their ideal cities. “When you use art as not a product but a process, people can imagine, investigate, reflect and build,” he told us.</p>

<p>By asking people to think creatively about their environment, James believes we can more cogently translate the values of individual communities and then work to design projects that fit those values.</p>

<p>That theme of translation, of breaking down coded language and using art to simplify complex ideas continued through to our “Artists Engaged in Public Safety, Housing and Public Health” plenary session.</p>

<p>The session began with Jamie Hand, director of research strategies at ArtPlace America, announcing the release of <a href=""http://www.artplaceamerica.org/blog/translating-outcomes-public-safety-and-housing-field-scans-released"">two field scans</a> which address two primary audiences: artists and other arts and cultural practitioners seeking to better understand and collaborate with a particular community development sector; and community development practitioners who are interested in how arts and culture might further their work. The goal is for these two audiences to develop a shared language and a collaborative set of goals, so that ultimately communities will benefit from the powerful, cross-sector synergies that we know to be a signature characteristic of creative placemaking work.</p>

<p>The field scans are in the areas of Housing and Public Safety and are part of, Jamie said, ArtPlace’s move from understanding “Creative Placemaking 101” to exploring “Creative Placemaking 201.” It’s time, she said, to start thinking more critically about what, specifically, artists can bring to the table.</p>

<p>This was perhaps the most provocative panel of the summit, with crowd favorite Jorge “Piper” Ferreira, a sheriff for the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office in San Leandro, CA, kicking off the session by discussing his transformation from a kid growing up during the crack epidemic, into a rapper, and most recently into a cop.</p>

<p>Through creative work like his one-man play “Cops &amp; Robbers” (Piper plays 17 different characters on both sides of an officer-involved shooting), he directly engages with both the community (performing the play in theaters and prisons alike) and the police department to instigate change.</p>

<p>“We can’t just focus on arresting more people this week than we did last week… We have to fight the forces that create crime. It’s just as honorable as fighting the crime,” Piper said.</p>

<p>Mel Chin, an artist and activist based in Egypt, NC, doesn’t shy away from uncomfortable situations either. After Hurricane Katrina, Mel went down to New Orleans to see what he could do to help.</p>

<p>“I discovered that 30–50% of the inner city childhood population of New Orleans was poisoned with lead before the storm and there’s no support for that,” he explained. So, he found a house where children had been poisoned with lead (“which leads to a life of inability of education and the capacity for behavioral violence”) and transformed it into Safe House—a type of art installation in the flooded NOLA neighborhood of St. Roch.</p>

<p>The final artist on the panel, Elizabeth Hamby, discussed her efforts to merge public health initiatives with the urban landscape in New York City.</p>

<p>“Health is something that we experience as individuals, but the factors that produce health are very much collective,” she said. To that end, Elizabeth created Boogie Down Rides, a bicycling initiative that transforms the streets of the Bronx—“our largest public space”—through group rides, advocacy and training.</p>

<p>“In my city, there are differences of nearly 10 years in life expectancy between neighborhoods that exist just a few subway stops apart. Our zip codes determine as much as our genetic codes when it comes to our susceptibility to chronic disease like diabetes and hypertension. The shift we have to make is from thinking about people and place, to thinking about people in place,” Elizabeth said.</p>

<p>Each of the panelists create such different work in such discrete places. The session’s moderator, Sarah Calderon, managing director of ArtPlace America, couldn’t help but ask why each of the artists care about their work, why they care about opening themselves up to the public sphere.</p>

<p>“Creativity gives me wings,” Piper said. “I don’t have to play by all the same rules that the people from the worlds I come from have to play by because I have creativity.”</p>

<p>“Art can make complex things simple,” he concluded.</p>

<p>What better endorsement for including artists in the development process could there be?</p>

226,"Communities Find New Ways to Access Cleaner, More Affordable Energy ",<p>How leading cities and towns in Massachusetts are scaling up renewable energy while bringing cost savings to their residents.</p>,"<p>When your electricity bill comes in the mail, do you think about changing your supplier? Massachusetts customers have been able to choose their power suppliers since 1998, to save money, have more stable bills, or go green. </p>

<p>But very few do.</p>

<p>While shopping around is common among big commercial and industrial customers, very few households or small businesses have made the switch. In 2015, less than 30% of residential sales were served by “retail power marketers,” according to the state Department of Energy Resources. The rest of the power was sold by the traditional utility. And while more than 90% of power sold to big businesses that year was competitive, less than 60% of small business sales were.</p>

<p>To help small customers get a better deal, state law allows municipal aggregation, by which cities and towns choose a power supplier for all of their residents at once. <span class=""InlineTweet""> <span class=""InlineTweet-content"">idea</span> <a class=""InlineTweet-cta"" href=""https://twitter.com/intent/tweet/?dnt=true&amp;text=is""> <svg width=""48"" height=""48"" viewBox=""628 -718 2048 2048"" class=""Icon"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg""> <path d=""M2417.2-86.6c1.2,17,1.2,33.9,1.2,50.9c0,517.3-393.8,1113.4-1113.4,1113.4c-221.7,0-427.7-64.2-601-175.7 c31.5,3.6,61.8,4.8,94.5,4.8c183,0,351.4-61.8,485.8-167.2c-172-3.6-316.2-116.3-365.9-271.4c24.2,3.6,48.5,6.1,73.9,6.1 c35.1,0,70.3-4.8,103-13.3C916.1,424.7,781.6,267.2,781.6,76.9c0-1.2,0-3.6,0-4.8c52.1,29.1,112.7,47.2,176.9,49.7 C853.1,51.5,784-68.4,784-204.2c0-72.7,19.4-139.3,53.3-197.5C1030-164.2,1319.6-9.1,1644.3,7.9c-6.1-29.1-9.7-59.4-9.7-89.7 c0-215.7,174.5-391.3,391.3-391.3c112.7,0,214.4,47.2,285.9,123.6c88.4-17,173.3-49.7,248.4-94.5c-29.1,90.9-90.9,167.2-172,215.7 c78.7-8.5,155.1-30.3,225.3-60.6C2560.2-211.4,2493.6-142.4,2417.2-86.6z""/> </svg> Tweet This </a> </span> The first municipal aggregation was the <a href=""http://www.capelightcompact.org"">Cape Light Compact</a>, which has served 200,000 customers in all 21 Cape Cod and Martha’s Vineyard towns since 2004.</p>

<p>Most city aggregations have focused exclusively on financial savings and price stability. In 2014, with grant funding from the Barr Foundation, the <a href=""http://www.mapc.org/"">Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC)</a>, a regional planning agency serving 101 Boston-area communities, partnered with the City of Melrose to use municipal aggregation to bring new, local renewable energy to the grid, displace fossil fuels, and reduce emissions.</p>

<p>MAPC solicited bids on behalf of Melrose for aggregation services that raised the bar for the inclusion of renewable energy. It was a bit risky; could anyone offer a product that would add new, local renewable energy to the grid while retaining the traditional benefits of aggregation? Happily, the market shifted to respond. The selected broker forged a new partnership that is helping Melrose achieve our collective goals.</p>

<p>All electric suppliers in Massachusetts are statutorily mandated by the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), first initiated in 2003, to purchase an increasing amount of their power from renewable energy each year. The RPS has been a key driver of the growth of renewable energy in the region. Since municipal aggregators buy large amounts of electricity, even a relatively small amount of additional renewable energy in their mix can have a significant impact. And, the more municipalities that do it, the greater that impact can be. Melrose, for example, with about 9,000 customers, increased the renewable portion of its supply in 2016 from the 11% required by the RPS to 16%. This represents the purchase of an extra 3,000 megawatt hours (MWh) of renewable power, supporting about 1 MW of new, local renewable generation. The contract also saves Melrose residents money, with rates at least 20% below last year’s average rates. </p>

<p>With Melrose’s success providing inspiration, MAPC has now launched an initiative to bring the green aggregation model to all 101 of its member cities and towns. In early 2016, MAPC competitively procured an aggregation consultant to implement programs for any member communities that want to add new, local renewable energy to a municipal aggregation. Already the communities of Dedham, Salem, and Swampscott have followed Melrose’s lead, with Arlington, Somerville, and Sudbury soon to follow.</p>

<p>As the Melrose example demonstrates, aggregation offers an exciting and potentially significant way to unite climate and economic benefits. The time is now for cities and towns to step up and use the bulk power of aggregation to negotiate better electricity supply deals for their residents that will also help combat climate change. Collectively, we can make a real difference.</p>

225,Inspiration and Ideas from Leaders in Clean Energy ,<p>Key takeaways from a recent workshop of city leaders focused on advancing clean energy.</p>,"<p>A couple weeks ago, I had the opportunity to join a group of municipal staff from cities and towns across the Northeast (from Quincy, Massachusetts, to Providence, Rhode Island, to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and more) at a workshop focused on sharing ideas and discussing opportunities related to clean energy. Barr sponsored the gathering as an extension of our new <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/clean-energy"">Clean Energy strategies</a>—in particular, our efforts to foster peer-to-peer learning and to advance solutions through local leadership.</p>

<p>The workshop was part of a larger conference, “<a href=""http://nesea.org/conference/buildingenergy-boston-2016"">Building Energy Boston 2016</a>,” held in Boston’s Seaport district and hosted by the <a href=""http://nesea.org/conference/buildingenergy-boston-2016"">Northeast Sustainable Energy Association</a>. Our session focused on a framework articulated by the <a href=""http://usdn.org/public/page/13/CNCA"">Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance</a> to transform (i.e., deeply de-carbonize) energy, transportation, and other energy-intensive current systems in cities.</p>

<p>Gustaf Landahl from the City of Stockholm and Susanne Rasmussen from the City of Cambridge led the discussion, starting with highlights from each of their city’s plans—including Stockholm’s <a href=""http://international.stockholm.se/globalassets/rapporter/roadmap-for-a-fossil-fuel-free-stockholm-2050.pdf"">Fossil Fuel-Free Roadmap</a> and Cambridge’s <a href=""http://www.cambridgema.gov/%7E/media/Images/CDD/Climate/NetZero/netzero_20150408_infographic.jpg"">Net Zero Energy Action Plan</a>. Both emphasized the importance of adapting their approaches to different local contexts. 
To date, Stockholm has reduced fossil fuel use for both heating and electricity to less than 20%. The graph below shows the decreasing trajectory of the city’s overall emissions against 2040 goals (originally 2050) since 1990.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/953/small.jpg?1642118215 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/953/medium.jpg?1642118215 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/953/large.jpg?1642118215 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/953/x_large.jpg?1642118215 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""City of Stockholm "" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/953/small.jpg?1642118215"" /> <div class=""FancyAttribution""> <p>City of Stockholm</p> </div> </div> </div></p>

<p>Moreover, between 1993 and 2013, the Stockholm region’s economy grew by 41% while greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 35%. Landahl attributed these reductions to a number of new policies and approaches (not any one solution) that substantially reduce energy waste, increase electrification, and boost renewable energy. Several implementation highlights include purchasing renewable electricity from hydro and wind sources for the train system, increasing energy efficiency significantly in new and existing buildings, converting from oil heating to heat pumps and widespread district-energy systems, and replacing fossil fuels with biogas and biofuels. Planning efforts in building, transportation, waste, and other sectors have also been important.</p>

<p>The City of Cambridge is in an earlier stage than Stockholm, having only recently completed an action plan to get to net-zero emissions from buildings. So Rasmussen’s remarks focused on the process to create that plan. We heard how the City’s attention to citizen feedback and broader, evolving trends added urgency to the process (e.g., business-as-usual would lead to more than a doubling of emissions in Kendall Square alone) and helped propel the creation of a clear goal. The action plan lays out steps to reduce energy use in buildings, require new construction to be less carbon-intensive, provide options to invest in a net-zero community, replace fossil fuels with low-carbon energy, offer industry training, and encourage community involvement.</p>

<p>After the workshop, I reached out to a few of the participants to find out what they took away as key lessons from the day. They noted how important and inspiring it was for them to engage directly with peers working on similar issues. What also stood out was the importance of starting with goals and vision. I’ve asked some of the participants to share their reflections in the comments section below.</p>

<p>It was a terrific day, and I felt fortunate to be there—learning alongside cities demonstrating leadership on climate and advancing real solutions for clean energy.</p>"
224,Introducing Cross-Program Initiatives,<p>Jim Canales describes initial priorities for a set of investments intended to complement and reinforce all of Barr’s core program work.</p>,"<p>Over the past six weeks, as a result of our planning work, <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/stewards-catalysts-barr-foundation-next-chapter-jim-canales"">we have shared</a> Barr’s new priorities in our core programs of <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/new-directions-for-barr-arts-creativity-program"">Arts &amp; Creativity</a>, <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/climate"">Climate</a>, and <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/new-strategies-for-barr-s-education-program"">Education</a>. Our announcement of <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/barr-foundation-announces-13-4-million-in-new-grants"">$13.4 million in new grants</a> earlier this month includes support for many of these new directions. It also includes grantmaking in alignment with a new area we are calling <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/cross-program-initiatives"">Cross-Program Initiatives</a>.</p>

<p>In this post, I outline some of our early thinking and priorities for this new area, which aims to complement and reinforce our core program strategies and to underscore the Foundation’s commitment to the region. With Cross-Program Initiatives, Barr will focus on advancing three broad goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>To invest in leaders</li>
<li>To inform sound decision-making</li>
<li>To support infrastructure for the nonprofit and philanthropic sectors</li>
</ul>

<p>To animate one of Barr’s core values, <strong>invest in leaders</strong>, we intend to continue the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/fellows"">Barr Fellowship</a>. As we plan for a new cohort of Barr Fellows in 2017, we will refine the program based on lessons from its first 10 years.</p>

<p>We will also explore ways we might provide more tailored support to leaders and leadership teams of Barr grantees, and we are eager to explore select opportunities for Barr to invest in local and regional programs that build and advance both diverse and new leadership for the public and nonprofit sectors.</p>

<p>To <strong>inform sound decision-making</strong>, we intend to target investments in organizations that support the provision of credible, objective research and analysis, as well as those that stimulate informed public discourse. Barr already has partnerships with many such organizations through our core programs; however, we have tended to focus on project support for discrete efforts aligned with Barr’s priorities. Through Cross-Program Initiatives, we seek to provide deeper, more flexible resources, recognizing the vital importance of these institutions beyond the specific interests of Barr’s programs.</p>

<p>Finally, as a member of the nonprofit and philanthropic community, we embrace a responsibility to invest in organizations that <strong>support the infrastructure of our field</strong>. Alongside other funders, we are exploring select opportunities to support efforts that improve the practice of philanthropy, as well as to enhance regional infrastructure organizations.</p>

<p>Cross-Program Initiatives will not be a new and separate program area for Barr; rather, it represents a set of aligned priorities that advances all of our other work. For that reason, this area of work is one I will be personally engaged in and that will be managed out of the President’s Office, staffed principally by Barr’s manager of special projects. We anticipate that Barr’s new vice president will be a key partner in this work and will, over time, take principal responsibility for the portfolio.</p>

<p>This year will be an exploratory one for us as we give greater shape to this emerging area of focus. We will build on early work and learning conducted over the past year, including targeted grantmaking that you can <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/grantmaking/grants?query=&program_areas%5B%5D=cross_program_initiatives#Grants"">explore in our online grants database</a>. The priorities outlined above are in early stages of formation, and we intend to refine and focus this work over the course of 2016.</p>

<p>For now, we are sharing our early thinking both in the spirit of transparency and to benefit from your input and ideas. We have posted <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/cross-program-initiatives"">additional details</a> about each of the three areas that will constitute Cross-Program Initiatives, and we invite you to <a href=""mailto:tpollack@barrfoundation.org"">send us your ideas and suggestions</a> as we continue to refine this framework.</p>

<p>We will share further details throughout the year. Compared to the levels of investment in our core program areas, grantmaking for Cross-Program Initiatives will be modest. Yet we are excited to devote targeted resources to organizations and efforts that are so vital for Barr and our partners to fulfill our missions.</p>"
222,New Strategies for Barr’s Education Program,"<p>Grounded in the belief that all students can succeed in school and in life, our new portfolio represents sharper focus and expanding reach.</p>","<p>Earlier this year, the Foundation’s trustees ratified new strategies for Barr&#39;s Education program, which represent not only a new, sharper focus for our portfolio, but also an expansion of our reach—with new engagement in the Commonwealth and broader New England region.</p>
<h4>New Program Goal</h4>
<p>Grounded in our core belief that all students can succeed in school and in life, the goal of Barr’s new Education program is <em>to connect all students to success in and beyond high school</em>. To advance this goal, we will align our efforts to the two strategies where we see the greatest opportunity for Barr to be a constructive partner: 1) achieving a new vision of secondary education in New England; and 2) expanding access to K–12 quality in Boston.</p>
<h4>A New Vision of Secondary Education</h4>
<p>The goal of creating a new vision of secondary education in New England will focus in three areas:</p>

<ol>
<li>Broadening the definition of student success to include competencies as well as mastery of academic subjects.</li>
<li>Supporting the development of new high school models and programs that are flexible and conducive to innovation, and that move away from an outdated, one-size-fits-all approach to secondary education.</li>
<li>Advancing system conditions that support innovative school and program models.</li>
</ol>

<p>We recognize that conducting this work requires us to adopt a long-term perspective and will depend upon our ability to form deep partnerships across Boston, the Commonwealth, and New England—just as we will learn from and contribute to similar efforts around the country.</p>

<p>This new focus also reflects a shift that is aligned with strong national momentum in the secondary space, in addition to research that underscores both significant need and opportunity.  By joining this growing community and national dialogue, we look to catalyze efforts that support the formal integration of diverse and important work that is happening across critical interaction points with young people. This includes the intersection of in- and out-of-school time, transitions between secondary and post-secondary, and greater connections to workforce and career exploration and preparation.</p>
<h4>K–12 Quality in Boston</h4>
<p>Our second strategy of expanding access to K–12 quality for all youth in Boston builds upon our strong and longstanding commitment to our home city. Our work here will focus on increasing the number of seats in existing high-quality schools and replicating high-performing public-school models. We will also seek to facilitate partnerships where high-capacity organizations—both local and national—can work with teachers, principals, and administrators to develop and implement high-quality programs in support of Boston schools.</p>

<p>To learn more about our strategies and grantmaking priorities, and how best to introduce ideas to us, I encourage you to visit our pages about our <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/education-regional"">regional strategies</a> and <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/education-boston"">Boston strategies</a>.</p>

<p>A central tenet of our strategic planning was to bring renewed focus to Barr’s Education portfolio in order to yield meaningful impact and results for students in New England. Accordingly, the balance between a New England portfolio focused on secondary and post-secondary success and our Boston-specific strategy to scale K–12 quality is an intentional undertaking designed to reach more students—both regionally and in our home community of Boston—through targeted priorities.</p>
<h4>Supporting Responsible Transitions</h4>
<p>While the opportunity to bring greater focus to our work is exciting, it also required making choices. We will therefore be winding down a number of legacy investment areas that fall outside of our new strategies, specifically in the Early Childhood and Out-of-School Time portfolios. We are grateful for the partnerships with—and proud of the contributions by—our grantees in these areas. And we are committed to dedicating the time and resources necessary to ensure thoughtful transitions for both the Early Childhood and Out-of-School Time portfolios. We have already been in close communication with grantees affected by this shift in strategies—both to plan for a responsible transition, as well as to identify opportunities to document, share, and celebrate the significant accomplishments from this work.</p>
<h4>The Work Begins</h4>
<p>As we embark in this exciting new direction, Barr is eager to join and learn from both regional and national colleagues, partners, and practitioners in this work. Our hope is that our new focus will deepen our knowledge and expertise, while helping to inform and inspire participation in the growing groundswell behind innovation in secondary education. Early reactions to our new strategy from the education community have been affirming and encouraging.</p>

<p>While this new vision is far-reaching and ambitious, it needs to be. We want to support all students so that they are empowered to make well-informed decisions and are well prepared to succeed in life.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to learn about Barr’s new Education strategies. We hope you will join the conversation with us on this blog and in other forums as we begin this new phase of work.</p>

221,New Report Positions Boston for Next Wave of Energy Solutions,<p>How a modest grant for one new staff member in a City Hall office set the stage for exciting progress on clean energy.</p>,"<p>Even though climate change is a global challenge, Barr’s <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/climate"">climate strategies</a> focus on the regional scale, advancing the leadership and solutions that have an impact here and also have potential to spur broader action. Cities are vital leaders of climate action. And sometimes a little extra staff capacity can go a long way towards extending that leadership. One exciting example is the recent release of the <a href=""http://www.bostonredevelopmentauthority.org/planning/planning-initiatives/boston-community-energy-study"">Boston Community Energy Study</a> that identified district-level energy solutions that are more resilient, drive down greenhouse gas emissions, and cost less to run.</p>

<p>While Boston does not have direct control over energy system planning (that is done at the regional level by the grid operator), this has not stopped the City from aggressively identifying opportunities to increase efficiency, deploy renewables, and explore opportunities to promote innovation in the city. Over the past six years, Boston has developed a highly successful partnership with utilities to help residents and businesses drive down energy use through community education and energy upgrades. As a result, <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/for-second-time-boston-named-nation-s-most-energy-efficient-city"">Boston now tops</a> the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy’s Energy Efficiency Scorecard.</p>

<p>Two trends call for Boston to take the next steps in energy innovation. With increased frequency and intensity of severe weather events, the region is vulnerable to power outages. The city is also projected to grow in population and is in the midst of a construction boom, which will add pressure on the electric grid and increase emissions—unless we find ways to transform how we generate and use energy. To help Boston move towards more resilient, less carbon-intensive, and lower-cost energy approaches, in 2013, Barr made a challenge grant to the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA)—Boston’s agency responsible for planning and economic development—to create a new role for someone to focus exclusively on community energy solutions.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -small -left""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img alt=""Travis Sheehan"" class=""Media-image"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/879/crop_preview.jpg?1642118004"" /> </div> </div></p>

<p>The BRA called this its “Eco-District Energy Fellow” and was fortunate to recruit Travis Sheehan, who had direct experience working on microgrids. Prior to working at the City, Travis was a consultant advising local governments on climate change strategies after receiving a double-master’s degree from MIT focusing on district energy policy and planning.</p>

<p>Travis has been working on several research initiatives, cultivating awareness and interest in community energy solutions, and scoping out pilot projects.  To understand energy demand and to identify innovative local energy supply solutions, Travis commissioned a citywide energy study. It soon became the kind of project funders love to see—where our modest support ended up leveraging a wide range of new, additional resources. Travis secured funding from the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security; and he partnered with experts from MIT’s Sustainable Design Lab and Lincoln Laboratory, Google’s Project Sunroof, and Eversource.</p>

<p>The resulting report uncovers data that, as far as we know, no other city has pulled together before. By simulating every hour of energy use in every building across Boston—incorporating solar radiance, building typology, weather data, and a range of additional inputs—the study team created a first-of-its-kind urban energy demand map.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/880/small.png?1642118006 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/880/medium.png?1642118006 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/880/large.png?1642118006 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/880/x_large.png?1642118006 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""The Boston Community Energy Study"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/880/small.png?1642118006"" /> </div> <div class=""Media-caption""> <p>energy</p> </div> </div></p>

<p>From this analysis, 42 “hot spots,” or high-potential areas, suitable for community energy solutions were identified. The criteria used to identify these areas included high energy use, critical/emergency facilities, and lower-income communities that would benefit from clean energy and reduced costs.</p>

<p>Potential costs and benefits of the community energy solutions were evaluated under two scenarios: one for maximizing reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and the other to maximize costs savings. The potential total benefits for the two scenarios ranged between $600 million and $1.7 billion over the 25-year analysis period. While more analysis is needed and much remains to be learned, the initial indicators are very positive.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--total""> <p>potential</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>In addition to the benefits for Boston, this study is a technical innovation that could be deployed in other cities to gain similar insights into local, clean energy infrastructure development opportunities.</p>

<p>To further help communities pursue potential projects identified in the study, the City established a partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy&#39;s Climate Action Champions program. Property owners will be connected with experts that perform no-cost feasibility studies for new solutions like combined heat and power and microgrids.</p>

<p>It was our privilege to help Boston create this opening for a talented young leader whose efforts have now set the stage for the City to advance boldly towards its clean energy future.</p>

220,New Directions for Barr’s Arts & Creativity Program,<p>Adapting boldly. Spanning sectors. Activating public support.</p>,"<p>It’s an exciting time for the arts in Boston—filled with forward momentum and opportunity. Three years ago, during the Boston mayoral race, artists, arts organizations, and engaged allies mobilized, lifted their voices, and called for greater support for the creative sector. This set the stage for Mayor Walsh to appoint Boston’s first cabinet-level arts chief in decades and to invite thousands of Bostonians to chart an inspirational course for their city through <a href=""http://www.bostoncreates.org/"">Boston Creates</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, over these years, through the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/arts-creativity/barr-klarman-arts-capacity-building"">Barr-Klarman Arts Capacity Building Initiative</a>, a cohort of arts and culture organizations have grown stronger and better capitalized to take artistic and organizational risks. And, through our partnership with <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/partners/artplace-america"">ArtPlace America</a> and creative placemaking investments in places like Upham’s Corner, Chinatown, and The Greenway, the arts are giving voice to residents, fostering economic development, and enlivening neighborhoods.</p>

<p>In this context of change and optimism, and with a mandate to articulate an ambitious goal, strategies, and priorities for the next phase of Barr’s work in this sector, last year, our Arts team entered into a period of strategic planning. We reflected carefully on the Foundation’s work and learning to date, on key trends in our sector (which I wrote about <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/three-trends-shaping-barrs-arts-strategy"">in this post</a>) that are giving rise to distinct opportunities for philanthropy, and on how best to focus geographically.</p>

<p>As Jim Canales, Barr’s president, previewed in his post “<a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/stewards-catalysts-barr-foundation-next-chapter-jim-canales"">Stewards and Catalysts: Barr’s Next Chapter</a>,” this led us to a new goal for Barr’s Arts &amp; Creativity program: <em>to elevate the arts and enable creative expression to engage and inspire a dynamic, thriving Commonwealth</em>—a goal we will pursue through three strategies: advancing the field’s capacity to adapt, take risks, and engage changing audiences in new ways; fostering opportunities to connect the arts to other disciplines and sectors; and activating public support for the arts.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--goal""> <p>new</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>To learn more about these strategies and how to share ideas with us, I encourage you to visit our new <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/arts-creativity"">Arts &amp; Creativity strategies page</a>. For the remainder of this post, I would like to discuss three key changes from Barr’s approach to investing in the arts in recent years.</p>

<p><strong>The first change is in our name—from “Arts &amp; Culture” to “Arts &amp; Creativity.”</strong> This shift reflects our intention to be more expansive, to invest in bold ideas, and to forge new partnerships with different sectors. We also recognize that the phrase “arts and culture” can evoke ideas of elite art forms disconnected from some people’s lives. In contrast, “arts and creativity” is more inclusive of the diverse (and often informal) ways people engage with the arts and creative expression to connect with their passions, their loved ones, and their communities. By naming our program “Arts &amp; Creativity,” we hope to likewise evoke and advance these ideas of connection and transformative power.</p>

<p><strong>Another change is in geography. Historically, Barr’s arts grantmaking focused solely on Boston. Going forward, we will engage with high-performing partners across Massachusetts</strong> and work to strengthen the connections among them. As cultural policies and financing options are developed and enacted at the state level, we believe that stronger organizations and more engaged communities across the state will benefit advocacy efforts for the arts. We will also participate in targeted opportunities in New England and nationally that bring intellectual and financial resources to Massachusetts and that provide platforms to share the effective work being done here.</p>

<p>Finally, our work to date has focused principally on strengthening arts nonprofits. While we will certainly continue this work, <strong>we will also invest in building critical, new connections with other sectors</strong>, bringing new allies into efforts to foster a culturally vibrant Massachusetts. We believe that integrating arts and creativity into other sectors will increase the resources for and the sustainability of the arts sector, and it will demonstrate the power of the arts in creative problem-solving.</p>

<p>We know that great art transforms how we engage with the world. It brings beauty into our lives. It gives us ways to express ourselves and make sense of the world around us. It enables us to imagine new and better futures. With so much creative potential all around us, we could not be more excited to enter into this next phase of work, in partnership with colleagues ongoing and new.</p>

217,Smarter Travel. Smarter Places.,<p>Barr’s newly-named Mobility portfolio aims to spur transformation in how people move around and how we build our communities.</p>,"<p>To address the challenge of a changing climate, the Barr Foundation’s Climate program focuses on the two areas that produce the most greenhouse gases: 1) how we generate and use energy; and 2) how we move around. I am pleased to introduce the latest evolution in the Foundation’s strategies for addressing that second area.</p>

<p>For Barr’s newly-named Mobility portfolio, our goal is nothing less than transformation in how people move around in Massachusetts and in how we build our communities. These are inextricably linked: we can’t provide enough low-carbon travel without good transportation options; and we can’t provide enough good transportation options without well-designed communities.</p>

<p>While we have made advances in the reduction of emissions via cleaner fuels and more efficient vehicles, in order to achieve the dramatic reductions required, we need both smarter travel and smarter places.</p>

<p>Smarter travel is about improving and modernizing the region’s transportation system. Smarter places is about accelerating the development of low-carbon communities. Change in both domains will require new conversations and new ideas. We need to shift from focusing on what isn’t working to what’s possible. Towards these ends, we aim to build understanding and foster dialogue about changing mobility needs and potential solutions. We also intend to bring those solutions to life, creating more walkable, vibrant communities that work for people—because when they are connected to seamless, modern transportation systems, we reduce our emissions.</p>

<p>To learn more about our new Mobility strategies and grantmaking priorities, and how to introduce new funding and partnership ideas to us, I encourage you to visit our <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/mobility"">new Mobility strategies page</a>. These strategies (as well as our <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/clean-energy"">Clean Energy strategies</a>) build on progress and learning since Barr focused a broad environmental portfolio in on climate change in 2010. Since we started this work, many new voices have come to the table and are actively engaged. What’s more, <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/proving-it-pays-to-walk"">new research</a>, <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/19th-century-zoning-calling-your-shots-not-this-boston-suburb"">pilot projects</a>, and <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/what-if-we-focus-on-moving-people-instead-of-cars"">learning opportunities</a> have helped push the boundaries of thinking (and practice) about what may be possible.</p>

<p>There is solid momentum. And yet, a few key trends in the context of this work (which I wrote about in <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/the-next-evolution-of-barr-s-climate-strategy-part-i"">this post</a>) and careful consideration about where we believe Barr can make the greatest contributions have led us to redouble our efforts and to renew our commitment to bold and ambitious change toward smarter travel and smarter places.</p>

<p>Throughout our planning process—and again in <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/stewards-catalysts-barr-foundation-next-chapter-jim-canales"">this post today</a>—Jim Canales, Barr’s president, has emphasized that these new directions are more evolution than revolution. As we engaged in planning over the last year, our mandate was to build on a solid body of work done over many years. Bearing that in mind, however, I will call attention to three changes in the Mobility portfolio.</p>

<p>First, we have shifted from “Transportation and Smart Growth” to “Mobility.” This is more than a name change. It reflects our view that people should be at the center of our strategies. Enhancing people’s experiences and their ability to access and benefit from well-designed communities and good transportation options is the ultimate focus.
Second, we are focusing on the larger mobility system rather than emphasizing any individual mode of transportation. Our focus is on creating a seamless, modern system that efficiently links many different kinds of transportation choices. We aim to simplify people’s experiences—making transportation choices easier to navigate, more accessible, and more efficiently connected. If we get this right, our mobility system will reduce greenhouse gases while improving access to economic opportunity and quality of life for our residents.</p>

<p>Finally, we also expect to expand our circle of partners beyond nonprofit groups, as it is clear that there are a range of actors in academia, business, government, and industry whose engagement will be critical to the next phase of this work.</p>

<p>In many ways, our region, and the entire United States for that matter, lags behind other parts of the world in mobility solutions. Yet we know our region has the potential to think big, to be bold, and to lead. And that is exactly what we aim to catalyze with this strategy. It’s an exciting time for us at Barr and we look forward to working with partners—existing and new—to advance these ambitious Mobility goals.</p>

216,Scale Clean. Scale Smart.,<p>The next iteration of Barr’s Clean Energy program aims at transformation in the Northeast energy sector.</p>,"<p>The U.S. Northeast is at an energy crossroads. Successful efforts to phase out the dirtiest fuels, promote energy efficiency, and regulate carbon have put this region at the forefront of a global response to climate change. However, reducing emissions to the extent we know to be necessary—80% by 2050—will require a concerted push to deploy cleaner energy and achieve deeper efficiencies. Towards that end, I am pleased to share the new focus for the next iteration of the Barr Foundation’s Clean Energy strategies, which is to catalyze efforts to help the region scale clean and scale smart. By this, we mean accelerating a massive scale-up of renewables and energy efficiency across the Northeast, promoting efforts to make the grid smarter to allow for that scale up, and supporting learning networks that help cities and states to get smarter about the most effective strategies from around the world.</p>

<p>To learn more about our grantmaking priorities and how to introduce new funding and partnership ideas to us, I encourage you to visit our <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/clean-energy"">new Clean Energy strategies page</a>.</p>

<p>Our region begins 2016 with a great deal of successes to build upon. Boston and Massachusetts have <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/massachusetts-unseats-california-as-national-leaders-on-energy-efficiency"">achieved</a> <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/for-second-time-boston-named-nation-s-most-energy-efficient-city"">(and maintained)</a> the #1 rankings as the most energy-efficient city and state in the country. Communities in Greater Boston are taking leadership on implementing clean energy and <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/mobility"">new mobility initiatives</a>. Other Northeastern states have also demonstrated leadership—including through collaboration in the highly successful <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/northeast-energy-program-lifting-economies-and-lowering-emissions"">Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative</a>, a carbon cap and trading program that has been lifting economies and lowering emissions across the region.</p>

<p>These are encouraging signs of progress. Yet, as we engaged in strategic planning over the past year, we carefully considered key trends shaping the context of our work (I elaborated on these in <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/striving-for-transformation-in-our-energy-sector"">this post</a>), the opportunities before us, and where we believe Barr can make the greatest contribution. In the process, it became clear that the time had come to evolve our approach from advancing the incremental gains necessary to achieve near-term emissions goals, to catalyzing dramatic, transformative change in energy generation and use across the region.</p>

<p>As Jim Canales, Barr’s president, has emphasized throughout our planning process, and again in <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/stewards-catalysts-barr-foundation-next-chapter-jim-canales"">this post today</a>, these new strategies build on a solid body of work done over many years. By design, they are more evolution than revolution. Yet, I will call attention to two distinct changes in the Clean Energy portfolio.</p>

<p>The first important shift for us will be geography. To date, we have focused on Boston and Massachusetts. Going forward, we will seek targeted opportunities to advance clean energy across the whole Northeast.</p>

<p>The other distinctive evolution in our work is in scale. Historically we focused on promoting changes in the behavior and practices of individual organizations and some sectors, like health care and commercial real estate. Going forward, our ambition is for even bolder, systemic impact, market transformation, and a new generation of forward-looking clean energy policies taking hold across the region. We know this will require the voice and leadership not only of nonprofits and foundations that care about these issues, but also of many other types of partners as well.</p>

<p>To see the region powered by clean energy will require radical reinvention of energy system across the Northeast. This is both ambitious and absolutely necessary.</p>

215,Stewards and Catalysts: Barr’s Next Chapter,"<p>Barr’s president outlines new plans to build on a legacy of good work, with ambitious goals and sharper focus over expanded geography.</p>","<p>One year ago, we introduced Barr’s new mission statement: <em>To invest in human, natural, and creative potential, serving as thoughtful stewards and catalysts.</em> Together with the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/about#core-values"">core values and approach</a> to philanthropy articulated by our trustees, these principles provided the basis for planning across Barr’s core programs of Arts &amp; Culture, Climate, and Education. I am excited to share the results of that planning.</p>
<h3>What Unifies Barr’s New Directions</h3>
<p>The strategies that will guide Barr’s next phase of work all share a focus on investing in potential. There are enormous opportunities before us for such investment, given the mix of visionary leaders, effective organizations, and powerful ideas in our region.</p>

<p>Our strategies also make concrete the aspiration expressed in our mission that we serve as both stewards and catalysts. Our stewardship manifests in our abiding commitment to stick with complex challenges over the long term, as well as our willingness to double down when we see progress. We complement that by seeking to be catalytic, embracing risk and investing in new ideas.</p>
<h3>Where We Will Focus</h3>
<p>We engaged in a comprehensive effort in each of our core programs over the past year. Guided by Barr’s mission, values, and approach, we carefully considered our work to date, as well as how the context has changed and where the opportunities for impact reside in each of our three domains. Through our <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/about/our-planning"">planning series</a> on this blog, we offered key findings even as our planning was ongoing. Ultimately, for each program, we sought to address the question: <em>Where can Barr have the greatest impact over the next seven to 10 years?</em> Here are our answers:</p>

<p>Our newly-named <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/arts-creativity"">Arts &amp; Creativity</a> program will be guided by the goal of elevating the arts and enabling creative expression to engage and inspire a dynamic, thriving Massachusetts. We will pursue this goal through three strategies: advancing the field’s capacity to adapt, to take risks, and to engage changing audiences in new ways; fostering opportunities to connect the arts to other disciplines and sectors; and activating public support for the arts.</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/climate"">Climate</a>, we are doubling down on our commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, focusing on two areas that generate the most emissions—energy and transportation. We have honed our Clean Energy portfolio at the same time as we are expanding its reach in the Northeast, and we have renamed our former Transportation and Smart Growth portfolio as Mobility, with a focus on smarter travel and smarter places in Greater Boston. Acknowledging that the effects of climate change are already a reality, we are also introducing a new, special initiative to explore opportunities to enhance resilience efforts in Boston.</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/education"">Education</a>, we are focusing our efforts on the goal of increasing the number of young people who connect to success in and beyond high school. We will also expand Barr’s work in both Massachusetts and across New England. At the same time, we will initiate a targeted set of new investments in Boston to expand access to high-quality educational opportunities.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--to""> <p>sought</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>In a series of posts over the next four weeks, we will provide further detail on the strategies and grantmaking priorities we will pursue to advance these goals. We begin with details from our Climate team on the next phase of our work in <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/preview/d48b8b02-a613-4019-939a-c1f715024611"">Clean Energy</a> and <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/smarter-travel-smarter-places-barr-mobility-strategy"">Mobility</a>, which are on our website now. In the coming weeks, you’ll hear more from our Arts &amp; Creativity and Education teams.</p>

<p>In addition, over the course of 2016, we will describe our further plans to invest in leadership, including the next iteration of the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/fellows"">Barr Fellows</a> program, which will remain a key initiative for us.</p>

<p>As we articulate these strategies, we are well aware of the critique sometimes leveled at foundations for imposing their ideas upon others or, put more bluntly, treating grantees as contractors hired to execute a foundation’s strategy. This couldn’t be further from how we see our role or the kinds of relationships we seek to cultivate. At Barr, we believe effective philanthropy requires clarity about goals and priorities, which allows us to identify partners with similar aspirations and to engage as supporters, facilitators, connectors, and constructive partners in advancing impact against shared goals.</p>
<h3>Honoring the Past, Embracing the Future</h3>
<p>As you learn more about our new directions, many of you will note that these strategies are far more evolution than revolution. That has been by design. From the outset, we sought to build upon good work done over many years, and to write a next chapter—not a new script—for the Foundation.</p>

<p>At the same time, I would highlight two significant changes:</p>

<p>First, while always retaining a strong commitment to Barr’s home in Boston, we intend to expand our geographic reach as we engage more broadly across the region. We also plan to pursue targeted opportunities for grantmaking at the national level.</p>

<p>Second, the plans represent greater focus for Barr in those areas where we believe our engagement can drive impact. Accordingly, we will be winding down some aspects of our prior work.</p>

<p>What does this all mean for current Barr grantees? Consistent with our commitment to demonstrate respect and care in all of our relationships, we are working with each of our partners to consider the implications of these new strategies for our relationships. In cases in which we will be winding down our support, we are committed to a thoughtful and respectful transition.</p>
<h3>Shaping Our Future, Together</h3>
<p>In our view, planning is not a static activity; it is ongoing and iterative. While our goal has always been to define a clear set of directions for Barr, we fully intend to refine and adapt these strategies based on what we learn and how the environment shifts. Our aim is to ensure we have staying power on complex and vital issues while avoiding rigidity.</p>

<p>At a time when the challenges before us can seem insurmountable and intractable, I am reminded of the late John Gardner. In an illustrious career that included service as president of the Carnegie Corporation, secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare under President Lyndon Johnson, and founder of both Common Cause and Independent Sector, Gardner once wrote: <em>“We are all faced with a series of great opportunities—brilliantly disguised as insoluble problems.”</em></p>

<p>Acutely aware of the tremendous potential around us, we embrace the same spirit of optimism at Barr. With humility and profound respect for the partners we are privileged to support, we choose to view the challenges before us as opportunities to be seized. And we are excited about this next chapter of collective work.</p>"
214,Meet the Creatives Behind Boston Creates,"<p>A conversation between the Barr Foundation’s San San Wong and Katarzyna Balug, co-founder of Department of Play, about the role of artists in Boston’s cultural planning.</p>","<p>When the City of Boston first set out to develop a cultural plan, it knew it didn’t want a cookie-cutter planning process. It wanted a process as creative as it was ambitious. It wanted to evoke as many ideas as possible about the city’s creative potential by inspiring participation from a wide range of residents, including artists and art-makers. To accomplish this, City officials knew they needed help. They recruited <a href=""http://www.deptofplay.com"">Department of Play</a>, a collective of artists best known for creating imaginative play zones in Boston’s public spaces.</p>

<p>Throughout the City’s planning process—<em><a href=""http://www.bostoncreates.org"">Boston Creates</a></em>—the unique ways in which Department of Play contributed to community engagement were really remarkable to witness and deserve to be shared citywide. In collaboration with <a href=""http://www.tdcorp.org"">Technical Development Corporation</a>, we are working to document the <em>Boston Creates</em> artist-city partnership and will release a case study about it later this year. In the meantime, I had a chance to catch up with Katarzyna Balug, co-founder of Department of Play, and ask for her reflections on the project. Below are excerpts from our conversation.</p>
<h3>Who were the artists involved with the <em>Boston Creates</em> community engagement process?</h3>
<p>The creative team was made up of Department of Play, which includes Maria Vidart-Delgado and myself, and three other artists: Shaw Pong Liu, Heather Kapplow, and Leonardo March. The artists’ work built off the <em>Boston Creates</em> community meeting format and brought a sense of creative adventure into the planning process. The primary goals were for the conversation about culture to be a cultural experience in itself, to make the public process inclusive of and relevant to a broader public, and to translate the sometimes obscure and abstract language of planning into relatable experiences.</p>
<h3>What type of activities did you participate in?</h3>
<p>Each of the artists first participated in the ongoing public engagement process: we attended team leader meetings, youth trainings, and community conversations, and we examined the information the public was offering the planning team. Then, each artist or collective developed unique projects that will be the subject of the case study, to be released this spring.

<h3>What was your favorite moment during the community engagement process?</h3>
<p>Department of Play created the personas of future-past curators, our alter egos in costumes and 18th-century wigs. Weekly, we would frame images of the ideas for the future of the arts that people had posted to the <em>Boston Creates</em> online map. During one of our outings, we were hanging a framed image of a co-working incubator, an idea for a site in Jamaica Plain contributed by a Boston resident, when a man approached us. After taking some selfies and laughing with him, we had a conversation about the location and the proposal, during which he voiced his concerns and asked a question online to the originator of the idea. We felt it was an illustrative moment for how local residents can engage with one another in critical dialogue about different visions for their city.</p>

<h3>What’s happening in other cities that can help Boston think outside its artistic box?</h3>
<p>One piece of work that comes to mind is by Alfredo Jaar, a U.S.-based Chilean artist who trained as an architect and whose works confront and rebuild from acts of injustice across the globe. He responded to a lack of interest in a cultural space by creating a museum, Skoghall Konsthall. Built entirely of paper, the structure’s architectural design respected and celebrated the local context. After opening its doors for merely 24 hours, the museum was burned to the ground, sealing its future almost simultaneously with its entrance in the world.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/797/small.jpg?1642117771 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/797/medium.jpg?1642117771 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/797/large.jpg?1642117771 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/797/x_large.jpg?1642117771 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""Alfredo Jaar, courtesy Galerie Lelong, New York."" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/797/small.jpg?1642117771"" /> <div class=""FancyAttribution""> <p><a class=""FancyAttribution-link"" href=""http://www.art21.org/images/alfredo-jaar/the-skoghall-konsthall-2000?slideshow=1"">Alfredo Jaar, courtesy Galerie Lelong</a></p> </div> </div> </div></p>

<p>The townspeople became museum-goers just as the museum itself was destroyed. Jaar’s delicate study of human sensation produced a void in the residents’ minds that mobilized a desire for a more permanent museum. Several years later, the town offered to commission him to design a permanent structure for culture. The thought of artists in Boston having this much freedom to act on and in public space is inspiring.</p>
<h3>Do you have any advice for cities thinking of adding a Department of Play?</h3>
<p>Department of Play is a liminal, collaborative space, a space for public imagination that operates in between established ways of thinking and doing, pushing the “what-ifs.” I think most cities have people thinking and working like this already. Perhaps rather than adding, it’s about identifying, then constructing a nurturing environment for the local creative and thoughtful populations, and finding ways to connect them to each other and across cities, to collaboratively make better places for all inhabitants.</p>"
213,An Update on Barr’s Global Program,<p>Heiner Baumann shares grantee highlights from 2015.</p>,"<p>One year ago, <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/from-the-president-december-2014"">in his President’s Message</a>, Jim Canales announced that the Barr Foundation would be concluding its Global program. I want to share an update on what the Global team has done since then and what to expect from us moving forward.</p>

<p>Our priority for 2015 was to ensure a responsible and thoughtful conclusion of the work we have been engaging in since 2010. Our grantees had a terrific year in 2015. Here are just a few examples I am proud to share of grantees’ milestones and achievements in their respective fields:</p>

<p><strong>Sustainable Agriculture and Climate Resilience:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Thanks to <a href=""https://www.oneacrefund.org"">One Acre Fund</a>, in East Africa there are 275,000 smallholder farmers achieving resilience against drought and external shocks through crop insurance coverage. In addition, 126,000 families successfully diversified their harvests and diets through adoption of alternative crops. More than 4.4 million trees were planted, creating $22 million in future income and sequestering 66,000 tons of carbon dioxide.</p></li>
<li><p>In Haiti, <a href=""http://www.rootcapital.org"">Root Capital</a> has helped create an environment where smallholder farmers’ enterprises are highly successful in developing the organic fermented cocoa value chain. As a result, for the second consecutive year, Haitian cocoa producers won top honors for their highly-sought-out variety of organic cocoa. In addition, farmers are earning higher incomes and reinvesting in the future of their families.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Community Health:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>In Malawi, <a href=""http://www.savethechildren.org/site/c.8rKLIXMGIpI4E/b.6115947/k.B143/Official_USA_Site.htm"">Save the Children</a> has demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of malaria rapid diagnostic technology (RDT) and treatment with significant potential to improve the health of children. It created and approved a national scale-up plan based on the success of RDT at the community level in Malawi.</p></li>
<li><p>In East Africa and India, grantees including <a href=""https://livinggoods.org"">Living Goods</a> and <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaaction"">BBC Media Action</a> have raised more than $20 million in follow-on funding for scaling up work that has proven to significantly increase health outcomes for children and mothers.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Clean Energy:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>In Ethiopia, the Government of Ethiopia and <a href=""http://www.mowr.gov.et"">Ministry of Water and Energy</a> have strengthened the market for improved cookstoves, leading to 2 million units produced and sold. The accessibility of these cookstoves is significantly reducing wood and charcoal consumption while decreasing indoor air pollution.</li>
<li>In Haiti, despite many in-country and other external challenges, <a href=""http://www.carbonrootsinternational.org"">Carbon Roots International</a> has helped mobilize a viable alternative to wood charcoal. Green charcoal production from biomass is now on track to triple capacity, with demand outpacing supply.</li>
<li>In East Africa, <a href=""https://www.oneacrefund.org"">One Acre Fund</a> has helped sell 152,000 solar lights, generating meaningful impact on expenditures saved ($35 per household on average), carbon emissions prevented, study time enabled, and quality of life improved.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to engaging with these efforts, over the last 12 months, Barr Global has:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Committed $4 million in new grants to existing grantees in order to best position them to complete projects started, achieve and sustain target outcomes, and attract additional resources for future work.</p></li>
<li><p>Approved $1.6 million to organizations that, a year ago, were deep into conversations with us about potential support and whose work we felt would complement that of our existing partners. One example is a new grant to <a href=""http://medicmobile.org"">Medic Mobile</a>, which will advise several of our current grantees on mobile technology.</p></li>
<li><p>Begun to document and share the outstanding work of our grantees, including via our website. The following video about Living Goods and their success fostering healthy communities is one example:</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Last year, 2015, was also our biggest payout year to date—totaling $10.3 million. At Barr’s December board meeting, our trustees approved three new global grants, the final new commitments for the program. In the coming months, Barr’s Global team will remain actively engaged with our current partners and will share more about their work, lessons learned, and impact.</p>

<p>We enter the New Year with immense gratitude to our partners.  It has been an absolute privilege to support their efforts.</p>"
212,The Skinny on Paris and COP21,"<p>Among more than 200 funders attending the global climate talks (COP21) that concluded last week in Paris was Jenny Russell, executive director of the Merck Family Fund. She offered to share her key takeaways with us here.</p>","<p>There are few moments when one has the privilege of witnessing a global movement. This past week in Paris clearly fit into that box when all 196 countries in the world reached an agreement to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p>There were many takeaways. Here are just a few:</p>

<p>Paris and France were model hosts. The city was in fine form and tangibly welcoming of “COP21.” Exhibits, indoor and out, filled the streets and open spaces. From lights on the Eiffel Tower to singing in front of Notre Dame, one was constantly aware of, and often awed by, the climate message. The little green logo for the event was in the metro, at the airport, and seemingly at every hub, along with a large crew of green-vested individuals ready to assist. The many armed guards walking the streets as a result of the terrorist attacks were also a welcome sight and ironically provided a calm so the focus could be on the summit.</p>

<p>Funders, 220 in all, came from around the world. Other constituencies in attendance created an all-time high for participation and tone: 150 heads of state, CEOs, more than 500 mayors, and dozens of governors, in addition to faith leaders, indigenous groups, youth activists, and NGOs.</p>

<p>What was particularly apparent throughout the gathering was the groundswell of leadership from cities (500+ mayors!), regions, businesses, and investors. This has been a critical driver of progress thus far and will continue to be in the next phase. And whereas prior meetings were hindered by a deep divide between nations in the global north and south, COP21 featured a new level of cooperation towards a common goal.</p>

<p>The advance work by the United Nations and world leaders clearly paid off. Each country submitted its own reduction targets and with the U.S./China side agreement, a glide path for success was hoped for and achieved.</p>

<p>So, what is actually in <a href=""http://newsroom.unfccc.int/unfccc-newsroom/finale-cop21"">the agreement</a>? Here are some of the major goals countries committed to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Limiting temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius, with aspiration of 1.5 degrees.</li>
<li>Submitting increased reduction targets every five years.</li>
<li>Applying a transparent accounting system to evaluate and monitor reductions.</li>
<li>Protecting indigenous people, including financing at $100 billion per year for loss and damage to smaller islands, forest protection, and management.</li>
</ul>

<p>The agreement also includes a statement that much of world’s remaining reserves of coal, oil, and gas must stay in the ground. Countries will officially sign the pact on April 22, 2016.</p>

<p>In addition to the language that made it into the final text, the agreement sends a message on several important points, namely:</p>

<ul>
<li>A strong affirmation of and reliance on science.</li>
<li>Emissions will have to peak globally and reduce to zero by the end of the century (meaning we cannot produce more emissions than nature can absorb).</li>
<li>We will shift to a zero-carbon economy.</li>
<li>There’s nowhere to hide. The unanimity of this agreement represents unprecedented momentum for climate action and a framework that is designed for global witness.</li>
</ul>

<p>It was an extraordinary opportunity to absorb the spirit and intent of universal cooperation and agreement. The week was full of firsts and upbeat “we cans and we musts.” It affirmed more than ever the need to build upon strong momentum and to carry on in this vital work.</p>"
210,Connecting All Students to Success In and Beyond High School,<p> Leah Hamilton discusses the growing national movement to rethink secondary education and its influence on the Education program’s strategic planning process.</p>,"<p>As we near the end of 2015, Barr’s Education team has been reflecting on a busy and exciting year of new beginnings and planning for the future. Anchored in the Foundation’s <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/about"">new mission and core values</a> outlined by our trustees, we were charged with defining an education portfolio that is bold, is ambitious, and advances impact across New England. Even as this work is ongoing, we are excited to share an update on our planning efforts to date, which have combined looking inward at Barr’s history with an external assessment of the local and national context in the education landscape.</p>

<p>We began by reflecting on accomplishments and learning from more than a decade and a half of education grantmaking in Boston—spanning diverse efforts in early education, K–12, and out-of-school time. Considering the range of those efforts, we entered our strategic planning process with a strong hypothesis that a growing national focus on preparing all students for college and career success could present compelling opportunities for Barr and the broader region. As national energy coalesces around an expanded vision of student success—especially for low-income and minority populations, which have long been a focus of Barr’s work—there is a growing call for stronger bridges between secondary school, higher education, and career/workforce options. Evaluating our local context within this broader national trend is central to our ongoing planning efforts. Accordingly, our work has been grounded in the development of an independent and data-driven fact base, intended to identify potential opportunities in Massachusetts and the broader New England region.</p>
<h3>Despite rising graduation rates, success in and following high school still lags</h3>
<p>Educational progress is often a story of some—but not all—students reaching new levels of achievement or success. Such is the current state of education in this country as it relates to high school completion and student connections to success.</p>

<p>The 2013 national high school graduation rate of 81% is an all-time high, and a 27% decline in the number of high school “non-completers” from one million to 744,000 between 2008 and 2013 is significant progress. Still, far too many of our high school students fail to succeed either in or following high school. The jobless rate for recent high school dropouts is 30%. After holding steady for a decade, enrollment in two- and four-year colleges dropped from 70% to 66% between 2009 and 2013. And for those who do enroll, diverse research cites overwhelming numbers of students requiring remedial classes, signaling a misalignment between high school graduation requirements and college preparatory needs: of the 1.8 million high school students who took the ACT in 2014, only 26% met college readiness benchmarks in all four subjects.</p>

<p>Inadequate preparation for college impedes student progress and success, as do weak links between secondary school, higher education, and meaningful career/workforce opportunities. The economic impact of students not connecting to success is significant, with conservative estimates of post-secondary remediation costs in the $1.5–$2 billion range. The Boston-based <a href=""http://www.renniecenter.org/sites/default/files/2017-01/MeetingTheChallenge2_Fiscal.pdf"">Rennie Center for Education Research &amp; Policy estimates</a> that the “1.2 million dropouts who should have graduated with the Class of 2007 will cost the nation nearly $329 billion in lost revenue over the course of their lives.”</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--to""> <p>imperative</p> </blockquote></p>
<h3>The groundswell exists for a national movement to rethink secondary education</h3>
<p>Significant efforts to redefine a vision of successful secondary education have started to yield a growing evidence base of success, both in new school designs and strong connections to college and career. Last month, the Obama Administration hosted the first-ever <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/10/21/white-house-summit-next-generation-high-schools-background"">White House Summit on Next Generation High Schools</a>, acknowledging significant progress across secondary outcomes and calling for more “schools that incorporate…more personalized and active learning, access to real-world and hands-on learning such as ‘making’ experiences, [and] deeper ties to post-secondary institutions.” Importantly, the commitments celebrated at the Summit reflect diverse national efforts led by employers, school developers, foundations, districts, and charter operators.</p>

<p>Other national efforts include bipartisan work on the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), which calls for greater alignment of college- and career-ready expectations with state standards. ESSA allows for pilots of innovative assessment models, including competency- or performance-based assessments that will help advance a broader definition of 21st-century student success. Our neighbors in New Hampshire are currently piloting a system of performance-based assessments in targeted districts, with an eye toward more comprehensive statewide efforts.</p>

<p>Diverse partners are already engaged in the work of creating new secondary designs and connections to success. For example, the <a href=""https://www.carnegie.org/news/articles/new-school-designs-building-carnegie-corporation-commitment""><em>Opportunity By Design</em></a> initiative focuses on the design and implementation of innovative new high school models. California’s <a href=""http://www.connectedcalifornia.org/linked_learning""><em>Linked Learning</em></a> effort—initially seeded by philanthropic funding—is scaling its transformative model of rigorous college preparatory academic and integrated workforce experiences to reach more than 310,000 California students by 2020 (comparable to the approximately 300,000 students currently enrolled in Massachusetts high schools).</p>
<h3>Advancing Barr’s impact will be informed by national momentum but rooted in a local fact base</h3>
<p>The traditional model of secondary education in the United States has remained largely unchanged for decades. Recent efforts from across the country provide an emerging practice base, a compelling rationale, and growing national momentum to shine a brighter light on efforts to connect more students to success in both high school and beyond.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--a""> <p>offer</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>To understand how needs and opportunities across the Commonwealth align to these broader trends takes rigorous analysis of quantitative data and qualitative perspectives—work that Barr’s Education team has been immersed in over recent months. We look forward to sharing findings of this work—and how it informs Barr’s new education strategy—in early 2016.</p>

<p>In his <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/philanthropy-and-risk"">blog post last week</a>, Jim Canales wrote about Barr’s “willingness to take smart risks on the ideas and partners with potential to reach ambitious goals.” We have taken this to heart in our planning process as we identify opportunities for bold, meaningful, and measurable impact in New England. At the same time, reflection on important work of the past and present is equally important. A decade and a half of constructive partnerships have yielded significant results and served diverse needs across our city. As we prepare to advance a new education strategy in 2016, we are equally excited to share the achievements and lessons from this substantial body of work. We believe the work of connecting all students to success will depend on both.</p>"
208,Quality Counts for Strong Starts,"<p>As she retires from the field, Mav Pardee of Children’s Investment Fund reflects on the importance of creating high-quality, supportive environments for early childhood learning.</p>","<p>Quality is a shared concern among many organizations working in early care and education. How can all children access high-quality programs? I’ve previously highlighted our grantees’ efforts to <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/a-new-model-for-quality-improvement-in-early-education"">measure and improve quality</a>, as well as to <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/a-new-approach-to-scaling-high-quality-pre-kindergarten"">scale quality programs</a>. Another longtime grantee focused on this work is the <a href=""https://cedac.org/cif/"">Children’s Investment Fund</a>. The Fund helps early care and education programs build the high-quality physical infrastructure needed to support them. Through technical assistance and capital for construction projects, the Fund ensures that facilities are not a barrier for quality improvement.</p>

<p>After serving as the Fund’s program manager for nine years, Mav Pardee retired this fall. She has more than 40 years of experience in the field, so I could not let her leave without offering a few words of advice for those of us continuing the work of improving quality in early care and education. Below, I ask Mav to reflect on her previous work and the opportunities ahead.</p>
<h4>Looking back on your work at Children’s Investment Fund, what are the one or two breakthroughs of which you are most proud?</h4>
<p>Two things come to mind: First, is that we focused attention on the critical role that facilities play in provision of high-quality care and education and the impact that the physical environment plays in healthy development, learning, behavior, staff commitment, and parents’ satisfaction. And the second was the creation of the <a href=""http://www.mass.gov/edu/birth-grade-12/early-education-and-care/financial-assistance/funding-opportunities/open-competitive-grants/fy18-early-ed-and-out-of-school-time-capital-fund-program.html"">Early Education and Out of School time (EEOST) Capital Fund</a>, which offers public financing to help providers invest in significant capital renovations or construction.</p>

<p>EEOST was developed to help providers that serve a high proportion of children on public subsidy. Subsidy reimbursement rates have not kept pace with the cost of care, so centers struggle to pay staff salaries and basic operating expenses, and they have no reserves to invest in the physical plant. We saw the impact of the EEOST Capital Fund very quickly. Banks made construction loans, providers launched successful capital campaigns, and, in a few cases, projects qualified for other public capital funding. It was the dedicated bond funding that attracted those other sources and gave them confidence that the projects were feasible.</p>
<h4>If you could visit the Mav who was beginning this work 10 years ago and tell her about the education landscape of today, what would surprise her most?</h4>
<p>The biggest surprise would be that, given the enormous body of research on brain development and the importance of early experiences on lifetime achievement and well-being, particularly for children at risk, our society has not responded with sufficient investment to ensure that all children are given an opportunity to succeed.</p>

<p>Policymakers, the business community, the military, and others have all embraced the findings, but investment has not followed. The chief source of public funding, the Child Care Development Fund, has repeatedly been cut back over 15 years, and there is less funding today than there was in 2001. Yet a growing number of children spend most of their waking hours in care, so we need to ensure that those services support their healthy growth and development. Mediocre services are a waste of money, yet only 10% of early learning programs nationwide meet high quality standards.</p>
<h4>From your vantage point, what are the biggest and most pressing opportunities in the field right now?</h4>
<p>Oh, let me count the opportunities…</p>

<p>Possibly the most pressing opportunity is to continue improving the quality of early childhood care and education. Improving quality would require well-qualified, well-compensated educators working in suitable spaces with age-appropriate equipment, materials, and resources. In addition, other pressing opportunities come to mind, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ensuring equity for low-income families.</strong> Currently, most children attend programs segregated by family income and, in many cases, by race and ethnicity. This means that poor children are more likely to be in poor-quality programs than children from more affluent families.</li>
<li><strong>Shifting the emphasis in public-subsidy funding.</strong> We need to provide care that supports children’s development and that would allow children to remain in care even if a parent loses his or her job.</li>
<li><strong>Making care affordable.</strong> Families of all income levels should be able to afford care. Working women should not need to leave the workforce because they cannot afford suitable care for their children.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is the biggest barrier to fulfilling these opportunities?</h4>
<p>The biggest barrier is the public will to provide sufficient funding. I know it would be expensive, but very credible researchers and economists have shown that creating conditions for healthy development in early childhood is both more effective and less costly than attempting to intervene later in life.</p>
<h4>What words of advice or encouragement would you offer your peers who are looking to take on the next decade of work?</h4>
<p>This work is important and it is never dull. The field is full of smart, generous, good-humored, and very committed people, so you will have great colleagues. There are numerous challenges, so you have many opportunities to develop new talents and interests. You can make a difference.</p>"
207,Businesses and Investors Step Up On Climate Change,"<p>Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, reports on how more business leaders are taking up the climate challenge.</p>","<p>Several weeks ago, I had the honor of introducing Vice President Joe Biden as he announced the newest round of dozens of major companies to join the White House’s <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/ClimatePledge"">American Business Act on Climate</a> pledge.</p>

<p>Eighty-one companies, including big tech firms, global retailers, food makers, agricultural conglomerates, banks, and electric utilities, have now joined the pledge to cut their own greenhouse gas emissions, invest in clean energy, and support the Administration’s efforts to negotiate a robust international climate agreement this December in Paris.</p>

<p>Collectively, these 81 companies employ more than nine million people and have a combined market capitalization of more than $5 trillion. They operate in all 50 states, showing that climate change is not just a “blue state” concern.</p>

<p>Best Buy, General Mills, Dell, Disney, Cargill… These American business icons and many more <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/ClimatePledge"">(see the full list)</a> do not buy into the tired rhetoric that acting on climate change will wreck the economy and destroy jobs.</p>

<p>To the contrary, they see climate action as an economic opportunity that can spur new businesses and jobs—while also benefiting consumers. As General Mills’ Jerry Lynch noted, finding ways to trap carbon emissions and keep them out of the atmosphere is “one of the big untapped opportunities” in agriculture. And Best Buy’s Laura Bishop noted that by selling Energy Star appliances, the electronics retailer has helped consumers save $70 billion dollars, while preventing 900 million pounds of carbon from being emitted to the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Not only is Best Buy selling energy-efficient appliances, it has achieved a 26% reduction in carbon emissions from its operations since 2009 through its energy-cutting initiatives, and it has pledged to reach a 45% reduction by 2020 through increased energy efficiency and renewable sourcing.</p>

<p>Together these 81 companies’ climate commitments add up to $160 billion in clean technology investments, which are a solid contribution toward what Ceres calls the <em><a href=""http://www.ceres.org/issues/clean-trillion"">Clean Trillion</a></em>—or the additional $1 trillion of investment that the world needs every year to limit global temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>They include investments such as PG&amp;E’s $3 billion a year to modernize the electric grid to allow for better integration of distributed solar, energy storage, electric vehicles, and other low-carbon technologies, and IKEA Group’s $2-billion investment in wind and solar to help the company meet its 2020 goal of producing as much renewable energy as it consumes.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--denying""> <p>no</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>In late September, six major U.S. banks pledged “<a href=""https://www.ceres.org/press/press-releases/major-u.s.-banks-call-for-leadership-in-addressing-climate-change"">significant resources toward financing climate solutions</a>” while calling on world leaders to reach a global climate agreement. A few days later, the CEOs of 10 global food companies <a href=""http://www.ceres.org/press/press-releases/global-food-companies-unite-on-climate-action"">joined together</a> to call on world leaders to do the same, while pledging to redouble their efforts to cut their greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p>Exciting progress in the corporate and financial sector, to be sure, but do all of these corporate actions add up to significant carbon-cutting action? Not enough. Voluntary actions by business alone cannot solve the problem of climate change. Governments need to implement policies to incent deeper carbon-cutting actions across all actors and all sectors of the economy. And businesses can perhaps make the biggest contribution toward solving the climate challenge by adding their voices to those calling for just such policies.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -aside -left""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img alt=""Clean Power Plan Support "" class=""Media-image"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/714/crop_preview.jpg?1642117453"" /> </div> </div> </p>

<p>Some are doing that already. Over the past year, <a href=""http://www.ceres.org/issues/climate-change/clean-power-plan/clean-power-plan"">365 companies and investors</a>—part of the Ceres network of companies—from across all 50 states voiced their support for the EPA’s Clean Power Plan, a carbon-cutting measure for the electric power sector that is a cornerstone of the U.S. contribution toward the international climate process.</p>

<p>But to shift the debate in this country, companies need to press even harder. Ultimately, companies need to speak more forcefully and collectively to convince our elected officials of the urgency for acting on climate change—and that together we can build a sustainable future that grows the economy, creates jobs, and benefits consumers.  I hope their voices are heard during the climate negotiations in Paris.</p>

205,Philanthropy and Risk,<p>Strategic planning has given us an opportunity to explore and define the role of risk in our work at the Barr Foundation.</p>,"<p>Absent the pressures of a ballot box or quarterly earnings reports, the philanthropic sector has the unique ability to adopt a long-term perspective and to take risks that other sectors may avoid. And yet our sector is often accused—sometimes rightly—of being risk-averse.</p>

<p>Last year, Barr’s trustees affirmed “embracing risk” as one of <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/from-the-president-fall-2014"">the Foundation’s core values</a>, but that begs the question: what does that mean for Barr’s work? Determining how we animate that value has been one of the recurring themes during our planning process this year. And core to that conversation has been the reminder that we are not risk seeking. We are impact seeking. To take risks should never be a goal unto itself. Our goal is impact, and what we embrace is a willingness to take smart risks on the ideas and partners with potential to reach ambitious goals.</p>

<p>In discussions among Barr’s staff and with our trustees, we came to three core conclusions about risk and its application to Barr that I want to share as part of our <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/about/our-planning"">continuing blog series</a> on Barr’s strategic planning process:</p>
<h3>Ambitious goals require risk and will surely bring failure</h3>
<p>When it comes to pursuing big ideas, we believe the paths to success will require risk and a comfort with failure. Indeed, we will view the presence of failure—either of individual grants or even larger initiatives that do not achieve intended outcomes—as a potential indicator of there having been sufficient ambition and risk-taking in the work. We will therefore encourage and support our partners to be ambitious and bold, ensure we are providing them with the resources to achieve aspirational goals, and accept that some results may fall short of our shared intent. At the same time, as my colleague Phil Buchanan, president of The Center for Effective Philanthropy, has rightly noted, foundations need to be conscious of the costs our failures may impose upon the intended beneficiaries of our work. Therefore, we must strike the right balance and avoid the trap of focusing too much on risk and, in the process, burden the very people it is our mission to serve.</p>
<h3>The only failure we won’t accept is a failure to learn</h3>
<p>When there is failure, we cannot accept a failure to learn, either from work with our partners or from our own efforts. If taking risks will require accepting some failure, in order to benefit from those experiences, we must commit to a mindset focused on learning, and we must be willing to share lessons broadly. Doing so will not only improve our efforts, and those of our partners, but it can help others understand what works and what doesn’t as we seek to elevate the arts for more vibrant, vital, and engaged communities; advance solutions for climate change; and expand educational opportunities. Recognizing that foundations do not routinely talk about failure, we intend to identify opportunities to contribute to this important dialogue.</p>
<h3>Our reputation matters, yet we cannot shrink from putting it on the line</h3>
<p>Finally, we appreciate that one important dimension of risk relates to Barr’s reputation. In our formative years, the Foundation always chose to stay behind the scenes. Yet, with a focus on some of the most pressing challenges of our time, we are committed to deploying the full range of tools and assets at our disposal—including, at times, our reputation and voice. Acknowledging that our partners are the ones doing the heavy lifting, and never chasing attention for its own sake, we firmly believe that selectively using Barr’s voice, activating our networks, and exercising our leadership can matter to the issues and causes with which we are engaged. We will not leave those tools unattended.</p>

<p>This means that Barr will sometimes speak out, even on controversial issues, and even when doing so risks negative attention or backlash. The key consideration for us is no longer the possibility of negative attention, but how confident we are that our position—grounded in thoughtful strategy, aligned with our values, supported by credible information, and oriented toward solutions—can accelerate the impact we seek.</p>

<hr>

<p>This outlines some of our early thinking about the role of risk at Barr. It will surely evolve and become more concrete as we outline and execute upon our new strategies in 2016. Consistent with the theme of this <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/about/our-planning"">blog series on Barr’s strategic planning</a>, we are sharing these reflections to provide greater transparency about various facets of our work.</p>

<p>But there are two other important reasons to share these ideas now. First, we are eager to ensure that our partners understand how we think about risk, so that we can have productive conversations about our work together. Second, we want to be held accountable to these aspirations. Where we fall short, we hope to be reminded of these expressed intentions so that we can adjust accordingly.</p>

<p>Needless to say, this is a work in progress for us. We continue to welcome your reflections, reactions, and suggestions, which I know will ultimately serve to improve Barr’s work and our ability to fulfill our mission of service.</p>

204,A Peek into the Future of Transportation,"<p>Kristina Egan, director of Transportation for Massachusetts, shares how start-ups and legacy companies are forging a brave, new transportation future.</p>","<p>Last month, I traveled to California and got a peek into the future of transportation. Thanks to support from the Barr Foundation, I joined a group from Boston and heard a great mash-up of ideas at the <a href=""http://cityminded.org/events/motm2015"">Meeting of the Minds</a> international gathering, then toured the innovation labs of Nissan and Ford in Silicon Valley. Here are my three biggest takeaways from the trip:</p>
<h3>Start-ups are disrupting mobility</h3>
<p>In Greater Boston, we’re starting to experience rapid changes in how we get around as the private sector puts more and more transportation services on the market and apps on our smartphones. Uber is disrupting the traditional taxi industry. Bridj uses real-time information to continually adapt its transit routes to where people are and where they want to go.  Hubway is steadily growing its service area, allowing more and more people to hop on bikes to cross town. Zipcar is reducing the need for people to own cars in the city.</p>

<p>On top of these innovations, smartphone apps are empowering all of us with information. Waze crowdsources information about traffic, helping us avoid it. ProximiT provides real-time information about Orange, Red, and Blue line trains. RideScout aggregates information about travel options, including transit, walking and Uber, to point us to the fastest way to get places.</p>
<h3>Auto companies want to be a key part of mobility, climate solutions</h3>
<p>As entrepreneurs and start-ups are disrupting transportation, legacy car companies are also innovating, trying to transform themselves from auto manufacturers to mobility-service companies. The reason? Top management keeps a close eye on global trends, and it doesn’t look good for the traditional car.</p>

<p>One Meeting of the Minds speaker from our neck of the woods, Mac McCarthy of the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, predicts that today’s three billion people who live in cities will almost double to 5.5 billion within 30 years. There’s just not enough physical space for all those people to use cars. Nissan’s innovation team agrees, and sees congestion and pollution as opportunities for Nissan to reshape its business model.</p>

<p>The car industry is at a turning point, and in order to remain competitive, it needs to evolve from making products to providing services. At Ford’s lab, Stanford grads abound. They are hard at work making bicycles smarter so that cyclists can push a button to report potholes and cars parked in bike lanes. With its business partner, Scoot, Nissan just launched a <a href=""http://www.scootnetworks.com"">pilot motorcycle sharing program</a> (modeled after successful bikeshare programs) in hilly San Francisco.</p>

<p>What’s clear is that start-ups and legacy companies alike want to be part of solving our transportation and climate challenges. Car manufacturers will continue to make cars, of course, and will make them smarter and cleaner. But they are also thinking bigger and starting to see themselves as part of creating zero-fatality and zero-emissions smart cities. Mission-driven Zipcar, for example, aims to “enable simple and responsible urban living.”</p>
<h3>Collaboration is in our future</h3>
<p>After hearing from entrepreneurs, bankers, and auto companies at Meeting of the Minds, it’s clear that the private sector is forging new solutions to the planet’s transportation challenges, and is willing and enthusiastic about linking arms with social entrepreneurs and mission-driven organizations to reduce transportation-related pollution.  Our statewide coalition, <a href=""http://www.t4ma.org"">Transportation for Massachusetts</a>, is exploring how private-sector innovations can advance climate-friendly and affordable, accessible transportation for people of low-income and of color. With the Alliance for Business Leadership and MassChallenge, we hosted a mash-up of our own this month (photo below), bringing together entrepreneurs, businesses, government officials, and community leaders to identify opportunities to work together to support technologies and services that can reshape transportation for the better.</p>

203,Striving for Transformation in our Energy Sector,"<p>As part of Barr’s strategic planning, Mariella Puerto shares the trends informing how our Clean Energy program can best accelerate climate action in the region.</p>","<p>My colleague Mary Skelton Roberts <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/the-next-evolution-of-barr-s-climate-strategy-part-i"">recently wrote</a> about exciting opportunities influencing Barr’s efforts to reduce transportation-related emissions. In this piece, I offer my perspective on trends shaping the clean energy sector and informing our thinking about the most effective ways to focus this complementary facet of Barr’s Climate program.</p>

<p>I’ve <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/a-route-to-climb-everest"">previously compared</a> reaching the region’s 2020 and 2050 climate goals to the difference between climbing Mount Washington (which is the highest peak in the northeast, at 6,288 feet) and climbing Mount Everest (the highest peak in the world, at 29,029 feet). While reaching the summit of either mountain is an accomplishment, there are major differences. On Mount Washington, the trails are well marked and the ascent is a matter of putting one foot in front of another—something nearly any determined novice could do on a sunny, summer day. Climbing Mount Everest, on the other hand, demands completely new thinking, skills, preparation, experience, and fortitude. As we have engaged in strategic planning for Barr’s Climate program in 2015, the summit of Mount Washington is in sight, and the urgency to shift attention to that Mount Everest of goals is even more apparent.</p>

<p>Over the last five years, Massachusetts and other northeastern states have demonstrated leadership, crafting clean energy policies that have spurred private-sector innovations and thousands of new jobs. They have been phasing out the dirtiest fuels, promoting efficiency, and regulating carbon through the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/northeast-energy-program-lifting-economies-and-lowering-emissions"">Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative</a>. In the energy sector, we are trending to meet our 2020 emissions goals with a final push needed to get us there.</p>

<p>Yet, reaching the Mount Everest goal of 80% reductions in carbon emissions by 2050—what climate scientists say is necessary—will require a new generation of clean energy policies, massive increases in deployment of clean energy, deeper efficiencies, and modernization of our electricity grid. Decisions made today will determine whether we pull it off.</p>

<p>As we look across the energy landscape from the slopes of our metaphorical Mount Washington, there are a number of exciting trends that present opportunities for Barr to help the region in its climb, as well as some serious obstacles we must overcome.</p>
<h3>1. Clean energy is growing faster than any other fuel source, and our energy policies need to catch up.</h3>
<p>Renewable energy is rapidly gaining traction as costs are plummeting and quality keeps improving. According to the <a href=""http://www.ferc.gov/legal/staff-reports/2015/june-infrastructure.pdf"">Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</a>, renewable sources—biomass, geothermal, hydropower, solar, and wind—accounted for nearly 70% of new electrical generation placed in service in the U.S. during the first half of 2015. Renewable energy costs have decreased dramatically in recent years. For example, costs for solar installations in the U.S. fell by nearly 52% between 2009 and 2014. <a href=""http://cleantechnica.com/2015/01/14/deutsche-bank-predicts-solar-grid-parity-80-global-market-2017/"">Deutsche Bank predicts</a> that most of the world will experience “grid parity”—the point when renewables without subsidies are cheaper than fossil fuels—within a couple of years. Nationally, even though solar energy just reached the 1% mark of energy load, there are already more Americans working in the solar industry than in coal and gas. This is an incredibly exciting time, rich in opportunity to advance clean energy. Our energy policies, however, haven’t kept pace. They still favor investments in what increasingly looks like a dying industry—i.e., fossil fuels.</p>

<p>Equally promising are new technologies that allow consumers to reduce and control how much energy they use, like LED lights, smart thermostats, web-based monitors and controls, microgrids, and affordable batteries. Along with renewables, these technologies are beginning to transform the U.S. power sector. However, today’s energy grid, utilities, and the policies that govern them have not caught up with these disruptive technologies. The electric system we have today was developed over the past century as a centralized, hub-and-spoke model, with huge fossil fuel power plants and massive networks of wires.</p>

<p>For this region to realize the full potential of low- or no-carbon energy sources and grid innovations, the rules of the game must change. And we see a continuing role for Barr to play in advancing solutions in this space—including support for research and analysis, strategic communications, demonstration projects, convening, advocacy, and more, as we work in close partnership with others.</p>
<h3>2. Cities continue to lead the way with carbon reductions.</h3>
<p>While climate change is a global challenge, cities increasingly stand out as leaders in climate action. Cities are setting goals, creating plans, and holding themselves accountable to carbon emissions reductions. Boston, for example, <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/for-second-time-boston-named-nation-s-most-energy-efficient-city"">now tops</a> the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy’s Energy Efficiency Scorecard and is receiving recognition by global groups like the <a href=""http://www.c40.org"">C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group</a>, thanks in part to its city-wide <a href=""http://greenovateboston.org"">Greenovate initiative</a>. Likewise, the northeastern states have led on climate policy, creating the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and pushing the legal challenge that culminated in the Supreme Court ruling that cleared the way for the Clean Power Plan, known as Massachusetts vs. EPA.</p>

<p>Helping cities advance efficiency and clean energy has been a focus of ours at Barr and, we believe, continues to present opportunities for impact. Cities consume two-thirds of the world’s energy and generate 70% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, they are home to more than half of the world’s people. By 2030, that percentage will swell to 60%.  Cities and states are critical partners for climate action.</p>
<h3>3. Knowledge-sharing networks are multiplying impact.</h3>
<p>While we are proud of work and progress we’ve seen locally, we know that innovative climate solutions are also being created and taking root in cities all over the world, and we have much to learn—even as we seek to share what we’ve learned from our experience. Through its participation in national and global networks, like the <a href=""http://usdn.org/home.html?returnUrl=%2findex.html"">Urban Sustainability Directors Network</a>, C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, and <a href=""http://usdn.org/public/Carbon-Neutral-Cities.html"">Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance</a>, Boston has been able to learn from and contribute to global leadership in climate action. Barr has been pleased to support and engage with these sorts of knowledge-sharing networks. And we expect to continue doing so. For example, with the recent advent of the Clean Power Plan, there is a terrific opportunity for states outside our region to benefit from the experience and perspective of participants in the highly successful Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.</p>
<h3>4. New, powerful voices are taking up the climate challenge.</h3>
<p>What began as an environmental movement has gone mainstream. Last year, the <a href=""http://www.thenation.com/article/voices-peoples-climate-march"">People’s Climate March</a> brought out more than 300,000 people from all walks of life to demand action on climate change.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, after issuing his encyclical on climate change, “Our Common Home,” <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/pope-rallies-mayors-to-lead-on-climate-change"">Pope Francis gathered</a> the largest-ever group of city mayors to the Vatican to discuss climate change and to sign a declaration committing to significantly reduce climate pollution. Last month, the White House announced that 81 U.S. companies signed the <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/ClimatePledge"">American Business Act on Climate Pledge</a> to demonstrate their support for action on climate change and support for a strong agreement at the Conference of Parties in Paris.</p>

<p>We know this diverse mix of nonprofit, public, and private voices is critical to move climate action forward at the global, national, and local levels. Over the past five years, Barr has partnered with a number of organizations to advance clean energy, ranging from the grassroots-led <a href=""http://greenjusticecoalition.org/"">Green Justice Coalition</a>, to the business-led <a href=""http://www.greenribboncommission.org"">Green Ribbon Commission</a>, to the government-led Urban Sustainability Directors Network. Through peer learning networks and technical assistance, we have supported initiatives to cultivate and build leadership on clean energy across these different sectors.</p>

<p>We have been inspired with the tremendous commitment and tangible results of all these efforts. Institutions and businesses that engaged in energy efficiency became more willing to participate and weigh in on policy issues at the state and city level, and ended up being credible, persuasive messengers. For example, last week, Robert Armstrong of the MIT Energy Initiative (MIT is a member of the Green Ribbon Commission) authored an <a href=""http://energy.csmonitor.com/voices-universities"">article for the <em>Christian Science Monitor</em></a> calling for universities and industry to work together to address climate change. In addition, the Green Ribbon Commission recently created a <a href=""http://www.greenribboncommission.org/reprize2016"">Renewable Energy Leadership Prize</a> to inspire our region’s largest energy consumers to implement renewable energy procurement strategies at scale. Groups are gaining momentum and drawing more voices to the table. Barr will concentrate on building this momentum and promoting leadership in climate action across sectors.</p>

<p>Our region has taken significant strides over the last five years to reduce carbon emissions. However, it is clear there is a steep climb ahead in order to meet our goals for 2050. We must take these trends into consideration, adapt our thinking, and build on past successes from within the region as well as those shared from other parts of the globe. We are prepared and excited to help our many partners collectively take up the challenge and to map out a route to that daunting, but achievable, summit.</p>"
202,Residency Program Redefines Teacher Preparation and Practice,"<p>Recently featured on PBS News Hour, Boston Teacher Residency is held up as an effective, scalable model of teaching in urban schools.</p>","<p>Last month, the <a href=""http://www.bostonteacherresidency.org"">Boston Teacher Residency (BTR)</a> was featured on <em>PBS News Hour</em> along with its founder, Jesse Solomon, executive director of BPE (formerly the Boston Plan For Excellence) and a class of 2009 Barr Fellow. The <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/boston-program-helping-teachers-make-impact"">seven-minute PBS piece</a> heralds BTR as a national model and innovative approach for recruiting, training, and retaining effective teachers for urban schools. It centers on a hopeful new BTR resident teacher in her first weeks of training in a Boston Public School.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full""> <div class=""u-fluid-iframe""> <div class=""u-fluid-iframe-inner""> <iframe src=""//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/meeDZNuF2bU?controls=2&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;wmode=transparent"" title=""Featured Video"" frameborder=""0"" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen loading=""lazy""> <a href=""https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/meeDZNuF2bU?controls=2&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;wmode=transparent"">A video on YouTube</a> </iframe> </div> </div> </div></p>

<p>Founded in 2003, BTR recruits, prepares, and helps retain high-quality teachers as a part of its central strategy to increase student achievement in urban areas. </p>

<p>Through an innovative clinical teacher preparation model, BTR residents work side-by-side with mentors in classrooms four days a week while completing master’s coursework. In doing so, they acquire both the theoretical foundation and practical skills to help them deliver high-quality instruction.</p>

<p>Compared to other teacher-training programs that require only a few weeks in the classroom, BTR offers extensive classroom training. As Renee Alves, resident at the Dudley Street Neighborhood Charter School shares, “You can learn from a textbook, but I think it’s a lot different when you’re in a classroom and you’re seeing it in person.” Upon completion of the program, residents commit to teach in high-need schools in Boston for at least three years.</p>

<p>BTR has also refined its model based on student achievement data. It now focuses on creating a professional learning community by clustering residents in schools so they can naturally share and learn from one another. In addition, BTR created a new position called the “clinical teacher educator” to serve as both a classroom mentor and a professor in order to bridge theory with practice.</p>

<p>Finally, the model now includes a pathway of networked, student-centered schools called Teaching Academies. Inspired by the best teaching hospitals, Teacher Academies counter traditional teacher preparatory programs by creating schools that are designed to prepare residents to be great teachers within a coherent school structure.</p>

<p>The success of BTR has raised the bar on teacher preparatory programs; half of all BTR graduates are people of color and <a href=""http://www.bpe.org/boston-teacher-residency/about/impact/"">more than 70%</a> of BTR’s graduates are still teaching in Boston after three years, compared to the national average of 50%.</p>

<p>The evolution and success of BTR is a testament to the hard work of its leadership, staff, residents, and alumni, who have dedicated themselves to serving students in urban schools. It has been Barr’s pleasure and privilege to support them over this journey of learning and impact.</p>

201,"Embracing Opportunities for Smarter Travel, Smarter Places","<p>In this contribution to our series on strategic planning, Mary Skelton Roberts discusses key trends giving shape to Barr’s strategy to reduce transportation emissions.</p>","<p>In his <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/from-the-president-december-2014"">December 2014 President’s Message</a>, Jim Canales shared our trustees’ decision to deepen and expand over time Barr’s engagement in our three program areas of Arts &amp; Culture, Climate, and Education. Since then, in Barr’s Climate program, with the active engagement of our trustees and with the counsel of an external advisory group, we have been taking stock of Barr’s work to date and looking carefully at how the external landscape has shifted since 2010, when Barr made a five-year, $50-million commitment to help accelerate actions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Boston and Massachusetts.</p>

<p>One exciting development since 2010 is the significant growth of philanthropic engagement and support for climate action. In this post, I discuss three major trends influencing our thinking about the biggest opportunities for Barr to impact transportation-related emissions. In the coming weeks, my colleague Mariella Puerto will share a companion piece on clean energy—the other focus area within Barr’s Climate program.</p>
<h3>1. Our need for a modern, reliable, world-class transit system has never been greater</h3>
<p>There are two closely intertwined ways to reduce transportation emissions: 1) shifting more people to modes of transportation that emit less carbon; and 2) ensuring more of the resources and amenities people need are closer to where they live, thereby requiring less travel. These approaches are like two sides of the same coin—smarter travel and smarter places—and are inseparable. We can’t provide enough low-carbon travel without well-designed communities, and we can’t design low-carbon communities without the right transit options.</p>

<p>In Massachusetts, and particularly in Greater Boston, higher proportions of residents choose public transit than in many other parts of the country. By the MBTA’s estimates, ridership increased by seven million trips in 2014, and is projected to keep climbing in years to come. Keeping up with that growth while also shifting even more people to public transportation is a daunting challenge for a host of reasons, including funding and management issues, and a backlog of maintenance projects—to say nothing of severe weather like we experienced last winter, which literally ground our system to a halt. Despite these challenges, we cannot turn our backs on the T. Making public transit an attractive, reliable, affordable choice remains one of the most effective ways to reduce transportation emissions. For example, a single suburban commuter switching from a private car to public transportation can reduce a household’s carbon emissions by up to 30%.</p>

<p>One troubling trend pulling the transportation-emissions curve in the wrong direction is that, as housing costs have increased in Greater Boston, many people find themselves needing to move to more far-flung communities lacking good connections to transit, job centers, and public amenities. In certain neighborhoods, this dynamic is at play even within city limits. According to a recent analysis by the City of Boston as part of <a href=""http://goboston2030.org/en"">Go Boston 2030</a>, only 15 percent of Bostonians live in places where they are dependent on cars for almost all trips. Yet, for the lowest income bracket, that number jumps to 30 percent.</p>

<p>To achieve our greenhouse gas goals, a world-class public transit system that also fills critical gaps in service must be part of the equation. And we anticipate remaining deeply engaged in the work of creating that system. It&#39;s good for people, good for the economy, and good for the environment.</p>
<h3>2. Transportation choices are becoming more diverse and appealing than ever</h3>
<p>For many Americans—especially young adults—the appeal of driving and car ownership seems to be on the wane. After rising steadily for decades, in recent years, we have been seeing vehicle miles traveled flat or even falling. Many believe this indicates a culture shift underway. Meanwhile, services like Bridj, Lyft, Zipcar, Uber, and others are thriving, making it easier than ever for many to leave their cars at home or not even own one at all. Self-driving vehicles also appear to be on the not-too-distant horizon, with potential to further upend car ownership and use as we have known it. It&#39;s important that we better understand the cultural shifts underway, and be prepared to design and support solutions that meet changing mobility needs. </p>

<p>Another mode that is changing the status quo in major cities around the world is Bus Rapid Transit, or BRT. As I have written about on this blog before, the highest quality, “Gold Standard” BRT, uses physically dedicated lanes, prepaid fares, and protected and beautifully designed boarding stations to create a modern experience that rivals light rail in speed and capacity. It is also faster and more cost-efficient to build. Worldwide, BRT has nearly quadrupled over the last 10 years. However, it has been slow to catch on in the United States. To better understand whether and how BRT could work here and what benefits it might bring, in 2013, Barr convened a study group with deep roots across Greater Boston and expertise in transportation, development, and climate. In <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/bus-rapid-transit-may-put-transit-excellence-in-reach"">its final report</a>, the group identified five corridors that show high potential for BRT. And we are now in the community outreach phase of this exploration, inviting residents to engage, react, and improve the ideas—to ensure that any resulting plans to advance BRT in any of these five (or other) corridors reflect and are responsive to community input and concerns.</p>

<p>Even as Barr’s work to catalyze, inform, and help facilitate a new conversation about BRT continues, we anticipate playing a similar role supporting investigation of other potential transportation solutions for the region – helping set the tables for creative problem solving based on good data, and with robust public input.</p>
<h3>3. Antiquated land-use policies still make it harder than it should be to build “smart”—even with abundant and growing demand for smarter places</h3>
<p>The potential for innovative modes of transit like BRT becomes even more exciting and powerful when they are well connected with other forms of transit—when, for example, transfers are seamless from foot to shared bike, to rail, to car or other modes. One benchmark for this is the Complete Streets framework, which emphasizes safety and efficiency for all no matter whether they choose to drive, take a bus, walk, or ride a bike. According to Smart Growth America, as of 2015 there are 712 jurisdictions with Complete Streets policies, with more than 70 added in 2014, five of which were in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Just as demand is growing for smarter travel choices, more and more people are moving into cities to enjoy these smarter places, which are walkable, well connected to transit, and have easy access to a diverse mix of resources and opportunities. Yet, in Massachusetts and many parts of the country, policies that influence development are markedly out of step with this growing demand. It is still far easier for developers to build sprawl than to build smart places. Furthermore, as cities become less affordable, more people find themselves in more distant communities that lack these sorts of connections. This dynamic threatens to worsen the region’s carbon profile, as suburban development is between two and two-and-a-half times more GHG-intensive than development in urban centers. There is no way to hit aggressive emissions-reduction goals if low-carbon transportation and housing choices become luxury goods only few can afford.</p>

<p>That is why we see a continued role for new research, like the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/reports/the-walkup-wake-up-call-boston"">“WalkUP Wake Up Call,”</a> released last spring, with guidance on where the highest-potential places for smart development are in Greater Boston, based on both economic performance and social equity indicators. We also see an important role investing in capacity-building for neighborhoods like Winchester that are ready to innovate (as featured in <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/19th-century-zoning-calling-your-shots-not-this-boston-suburb"">“1970s zoning calling your shots? Not this Boston Suburb,”</a> a guest post by Andre Leroux, executive director of the Massachusetts Smart Growth Alliance).</p>

<p>Early next year, we will be ready to say more about the particular role we see for Barr, given these trends. I can say already, however, we are excited about the direction this next evolution of our work is taking us, and to continue working in partnership with others to advance mobility solutions in this region.</p>

<p><em>This blog is part of the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/categories/barr-planning-2015"">Barr Planning 2015</a> series where staff members share important dimensions of their planning work.</em></p>"
200,A Transportation Plan that Began With a Question,"<p>Alice Brown, former project manager for Go Boston 2030, talks about the innovative ways the City has engaged thousands of Bostonians in a new conversation about the future of how people get around.</p>","<p>What’s your question about getting around Boston in the future?</p>

<p>That simple question catalyzed a transportation planning process unlike any other. <em><a href=""http://goboston2030.org/en"">Go Boston 2030</a></em>, a citywide plan, is focused on producing transformative policies and projects that will reshape urban mobility over the next 15 years. Since January 2015, the process has focused on building a dialogue between the City and the wide range of people who rely on its sidewalk, streets, and transit to get where they need to go.</p>

<p>With support from the Barr Foundation (Mary Skelton Roberts <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/join-the-conversation-boston-transportation-future-goboston2030"">wrote about the launch</a> of the program last year), the Boston Transportation Department has worked with the Interaction Institute for Social Change to engage Boston’s residents, workers, and visitors in developing a Vision Framework and an Action Plan. Rather than host a series of traditional public meetings, we sought from the beginning to create interactive events and opportunities designed for people of different ages, abilities, languages, and transportation preferences to provide feedback.</p>

<p>The planning process kicked off in January 2015 with a <a href=""http://goboston2030.org/the-question-campaign"">Question Campaign</a> that invited people to ask questions through an online platform where they could read and “like” ideas posted by others. People could also donate questions by visiting a Question Truck that drove to neighborhoods across the city collecting questions on cards, the truck’s windows, or Plexiglas hexagons. Participants learned about the process through email blasts, social media, and provocative advertisements posted on the T and around the city.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/680/small.jpg?1642117360 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/680/medium.jpg?1642117360 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/680/large.jpg?1642117360 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/680/x_large.jpg?1642117360 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""Go Boston 2030 "" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/680/small.jpg?1642117360"" /> <div class=""FancyAttribution""> <p><a class=""FancyAttribution-link"" href=""http://goboston2030.org/en/"">Go Boston 2030</a></p> </div> </div> </div></p>

<p>In order to synthesize key themes from the 5,000 questions we collected into a meaningful vision and specific goals, 60 community and interagency partners reviewed them all and worked together to select a set of provocative and representative questions. These priority questions, along with images of what the future might offer, were shared at a two-day <a href=""http://goboston2030.org/visioning-lab"">Visioning Lab</a>—a hands-on, museum-like forum that invited people to read and react to questions, write  their responses on the walls, and even design their ideas of what a better transportation system might look like, using collage materials, pipe cleaners, and LEGOs. Participants also had the opportunity to engage with data visualizations of the existing conditions in Boston, attend discussions, and enjoy art and live performances related to mobility.</p>

<p>We organized the lab around the cross-cutting themes that came up in the question campaign: access, safety, reliability, experiential quality, innovation and technology, affordability, sustainability and resiliency, governance, and health. The just-released draft <a href=""http://goboston2030.org/vision-framework"">Vision Framework</a> uses the same themes to lay out the goals and aspirational targets we will use to guide the remainder of the planning process. The vision also emphasizes that decision-making and project selection will focus on improving equity, climate responsiveness, and economic opportunity.</p>

<p>This fall, as <em>Go Boston 2030</em> has moved into building an action plan, we are using new engagement techniques to solicit project and policy ideas. Our bicycle-powered “Ideas on the Street” trailer has already been to 31 neighborhood locations and collected ideas on paper hexagons and maps using the Vision Framework as a tool for shaping the conversation.</p>

<p>A mobile-friendly website also allows people to <a href=""http://goboston2030.org/submit-ideas"">share ideas</a>. We are also collecting insights and personal narratives about the current and future needs of residents through <em><a href=""http://goboston2030.org/category/trip-stories"">Share Your Trip with BTD</a></em>, a program that matches Boston residents with Transportation Department staff with people who tag along on their regular, daily trips. Finally, we will soon be launching a series of <a href=""http://goboston2030.org/idea-roundtables"">Idea Roundtables</a>, where people will have opportunities to discuss with their neighbors the kinds of mobility challenges the city may face over the next decade and a half and to develop solutions.</p>

<p>We are excited about the incredible level of engagement throughout this process and the progress we are making towards crafting an implementation plan to radically improve how everyone gets around Boston. The final plan will be released in spring 2016 with a five-year capital plan.</p>

199,“Makers” Unleashed,<p>Jaime Cortez shares how the maker movement is informing Barr’s planning for its Arts program.</p>,"<p>In <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/three-trends-shaping-barrs-arts-strategy"">her post</a> last week, San San Wong described three major trends that have emerged as central to our planning for the future of Barr’s Arts program:</p>

<ol>
<li>Demographics and patterns of cultural engagement are changing rapidly and dramatically.</li>
<li>Technology is continually reshaping arts and culture and how people engage.</li>
<li>New sectors, disciplines are tapping the power of creative expression.</li>
</ol>

<p>As a follow up to San San’s piece, I wanted to say more about one exciting manifestation of those trends. Referred to as the “arts plus,” “maker,” or “DIY” movement (nicely summarized by Brit Morin in <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brit-morin/what-is-the-maker-movemen_b_3201977.html"">a 2013 article for <em>The Huffington Post</em></a>), there is a growing culture of creators drawing on facets of engineering, art, design, artisanal crafting, wood- and metal-working, robotics, and entrepreneurship to make things that solve problems in innovative ways, bring beauty and pleasure, and give creators the joy of tinkering, sharing, or selling their creations. A fast-expanding network of facilities like <a href=""http://www.techshop.ws/locations.html"">TechShop</a> (founded and headquartered in San Jose, California, and now with locations in six states and the District of Columbia) provide access to traditional and cutting-edge fabrication hardware, software, and tools.</p>

<p>The maker movement has been taking off in Boston, as well. In August, Barr provided a grant to <a href=""http://www.fab11.org"">Fab11</a>, the 11th annual gathering of people involved in <a href=""http://fab.cba.mit.edu/about/faq"">FabLabs</a>, a network of publicly accessible prototyping and fabrication facilities birthed at MIT. Four hundred people from more than 50 countries gathered in Boston for the event. I joined too—for what was one of my first site visits following my arrival in Boston and at Barr earlier that month. In a symposium series at a packed Symphony Hall, we heard from city planners, social entrepreneurs, and technologists about how technology and creativity are inspiring solutions to complex problems. Vicente Guallart, former chief architect of the City of Barcelona, Spain, was particularly inspiring with his vision of a facility that would receive Barcelona’s trash and mine it for materials that can be recycled to make useful objects, or even to grow food. The facility is part of the City’s plan to reach 100% self-sufficiency (and create local jobs along the way).</p>

<p>Hundreds more attended <a href=""http://www.fab11.org/fab-festival/boston-fab-festival/boston-fabfest-sponsor"">FabFest</a>, a free maker fair at the Reggie Lewis Center in Roxbury. There we saw work created by engineers, artists, tinkerers, and children—including toys, sculptures, furniture, clothing, bicycles, and medical devices. One young man showed a prosthetic hand he had designed and made. Missing a hand himself, he was able to demonstrate the smoothly articulated joints of the device and discuss the challenges of making a functional prosthetic.</p>

<p>Being at the intersection of so many disciplines gives FabLabs and maker fairs remarkable energy and broad appeal. This blending of arts and other disciplines is clearly an important and exciting trend in our field—one with which Barr has already been engaging through our support of FabLab11 and our continuing participation in the national <a href=""http://www.artplaceamerica.org"">ArtPlace America</a> initiative. And we are excited to be shaping a strategy for new investments in this area in the years to come.</p>"
198,Three Trends Shaping Barr’s Arts Strategy,<p>San San Wong discusses three major trends Barr’s arts team is exploring in the context of strategic planning.</p>,"<p>In his post last month, “<a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/radio-silence-not-required"">Radio Silence Not Required</a>,” Jim Canales initiated a <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/categories/barr-planning-2015"">new series</a> intended to shed light on Barr’s strategic planning efforts. This series offers an opportunity for us to share what we are learning and how we are aligning Barr’s strategies to key trends shaping our fields.</p>

<p>In the arts program, our planning is leading us towards clarity about how we will focus and deepen prior work, as well as explore exciting new domains. Here, I share three trends that have emerged as central to our future plans. </p>
<h3>1. Demographics and patterns of cultural engagement are changing rapidly and dramatically.</h3>
<p>The profound changes in demographics and how people are engaging in artistic and creative experiences is something we have had our eyes on for some time. Indeed, it is one of the topics our grantee partners in the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/arts-culture/barr-klarman-arts-capacity-building"">Barr Klarman Arts Capacity Building Initiative</a> have been exploring together. The blog post, “<a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/boston-arts-audience-diversification"">How New Audiences Came Through Our Doors</a>,” offers some ideas from the Huntington Theatre and Lyric Stage about their efforts to engage new audiences. To enrich this conversation, in May, the Barr Foundation and the Klarman Family Foundation invited sociologist Dr. Manuel Pastor to Boston, to speak on how demographic changes in race, ethnicity, age, and income define who will be making and engaging with arts and culture. The breadth and depth of demographic changes <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/boston-arts-audience-diversification"">Dr. Pastor outlined</a> were striking. Furthermore, the ways of making and engaging in creativity are growing exponentially through technology. In the face of these demographic and technological changes, arts organizations and philanthropy have had, for the most part, difficulty keeping up. As a result, they have struggled to retain and attract new audiences; build support for the arts; nurture and experiment with diverse cultural expressions and new art forms; and keep themselves vibrant, current, and relevant.</p>

<p>Through the landmark 2012 <em><a href=""http://arts.gov/news/2013/national-endowment-arts-presents-highlights-2012-survey-public-participation-arts"">Survey of Public Participation in the Arts</a></em>, the National Endowment for the Arts found that audiences for traditional Western-European forms of arts and culture – classical music, ballets, operas, and plays – have declined since the 1980s and in some cases, dropped dramatically. Between 2008 and 2012, attendance dropped 9% at musicals and 12% at non-musical theater.  Museum attendance dropped 21%.</p>

<p>Even as demographics are shifting dramatically, audiences for these art forms continue to be dominated by older, white, wealthy, and educated patrons. Arts presenters also face competition from online and other low-cost, 24-hour-a-day entertainment options. Meanwhile, the costs of making and presenting live cultural experiences have gone up, while the amount audiences are willing to pay for these experiences has not kept pace.</p>

<p>The news is not uniformly negative.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--for""> <p>audiences</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>WolfBrown’s 2008 <em><a href=""http://www.giarts.org/sites/default/files/Cultural-Engagement-in-Californias-Inland-Regions.pdf"">Cultural Engagement in California’s Inland Empire</a></em> study, commissioned by the Irvine Foundation, found that people were practicing more forms of arts and culture, in a much broader array of settings. While traditional venues are still favored for disciplines like theater, music, and visual arts, the most common location for experiencing and engaging with music, dance and visual arts is at home. </p>

<p>Outdoor activities, such as fairs and festivals, are growing in popularity and importance, particularly in communities of color and among young adults. Participation among adults in cultural activities via technological or nontraditional means is up by almost two-thirds.  Arts are thriving in formal and informal settings that promote social interaction in an arts context, like karaoke, young professional nights at museums, or drop-in ceramics painting studios.</p>

<p>Staying relevant in this rapidly changing context will require organizations to have the capacity to experiment and take artistic and organizational risks. Helping arts organizations thoughtfully build that adaptive capacity is one of the central themes of the Barr Klarman Arts Capacity Building Initiative. And we certainly see a continued role for Barr in this area. </p>
<h3>2. Technology is continually reshaping arts and culture and how people engage.</h3>
<p>Another trend we are looking at closely is how technology is shaping culture. Up until the 20th century, people’s cultural values and life were shaped primarily by local, everyday experiences (handcrafted furniture, social dances at holidays). At the beginning of the 20th century, with the advancements in sound and broadcasting, and the growth of the movie industry, professionals, celebrities, and creative industries began producing culture on a mass scale. In the second half of the last century, with philanthropic investments, arts were professionalized, and there was a proliferation of nonprofit, professional arts organizations, primarily rooted in Western-European canonic art forms. Arts participation and engagement had formerly been local, and accessible to many.  Yet, it became an elite pursuit – beautiful but institutionalized, professionalized, and distant. </p>

<p>In the 21st century, technology is helping re-democratize access to the arts.  Artists and amateurs alike can create art with increasingly affordable, high-quality production equipment. Devices like smart phones and tablets, and content providers like Netflix enable consumers to create and curate their own cultural experiences, with a global reach to the diversity of art. The internet now allows for an unprecedented sharing of creative work, which can reach millions of people via popular sharing and sales websites like Spotify (music, 40 million monthly users), Etsy (craft, 21.7 million monthly users), Instagram (photo, 300 million monthly users), or DeviantArt (art, 65 million monthly users).</p>

<p>Another example is <a href=""http://howlround.com/"">HowlRound</a> at Emerson College. The U.S. theater sector has been dominated historically by large and established theaters, with little room for the voice and power of individual artists and small theaters. HowlRound calls itself a “knowledge commons” and aims to reverse this imbalance.  It is an online platform, and forum with international reach, allowing both established and emerging theater professionals to engage and exchange ideas on an incredibly diverse range of creative and professional topics – while building a more inclusive sense of community.</p>

<p>Technologies that provide this level of connection, access to knowledge, and streamlined production are here to stay, and will only grow. As they do, we suspect there will be a constructive role for philanthropy, and for Barr in particular, to help catalyze and support new approaches that push the field even further, opening doors that engage and “re-democratize” creative expression. In an upcoming blog post, Jaime Cortez will discuss one of these new approaches in more detail: the maker movement.</p>
<h3>3. New sectors, disciplines are tapping the power of creative expression.</h3>
<p>The last exciting trend that I would like to share is the conjoining of arts with other disciplines and sectors. One example of this trend is the national initiative, <a href=""http://www.artplaceamerica.org/"">ArtPlace America</a>, in which Barr is a partner. ArtPlace America focuses on advancing the concept of “creative placemaking,” in which arts are integrated in place-based community planning and development.  Arts-infused community development is exemplified in the works of Chicago architect and social practitioner Theaster Gates. His organization, the <a href=""https://rebuild-foundation.org/"">Rebuild Foundation</a>, refurbishes derelict, empty buildings to create art spaces where an entire neighborhood can contribute to reinventing itself through the arts and cultural expression.  Through his efforts, the long-declining Dorchester Projects neighborhood of Chicago has been invigorated with multiple art venues offering culturally-relevant arts to the neighborhood. <a href=""http://www.fairmountculturalcorridor.org/"">The Fairmount Cultural Corridor</a> and Boston’s Upham’s Corner neighborhood, supported by Barr, along with ArtPlace, The Boston Foundation and others, is the most developed local example. A diverse coalition of arts, sustainable economic development, and community development organizations are incorporating creative processes to engage residents and businesses in planning for public works improvements, safety, and increased neighborhood visibility.  We are excited to see this initiative continue to develop, as well as explore new places ready to put these principles into practice.</p>

<p>Another area, which would be new for Barr, but which looks to be rich in opportunity is the intersection between arts and medicine. Endowed with some of the best medical institutions in the world, we believe Massachusetts has enormous potential to lead in these growing fields of practice. Indeed, we are already seeing some fascinating examples. For example, in the burgeoning field of music neuroscience, hospitals and medical researchers – like Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women’s, and Boston Children’s Hospital - are drawing on world-class tech resources and expertise to learn how music and the brain interact.  Training institutions, like Harvard, Tufts, and Boston University medical schools, are integrating the arts and humanities in new ways that enhance doctors’ abilities to understand and connect with patients, leading to improved health outcomes.</p>

<p>In addition to looking at key trends, with Barr’s new mission, “to invest in human, natural, and cultural potential, serving as thoughtful stewards and catalysts,” we have also been reflecting on how the concept of catalyst has and will continue to manifest in our work. We anticipate opportunities to commission new research, convene partners to hear invited thought leaders present on provocative ideas, and support organizations that are playing a catalytic role – using art and creative expression as an agent of change in their communities, disciplines and sectors, connecting people to their passions, to each other, and to their communities.</p>

<p>This time to reflect and assess the environment is stretching our thinking about our organizing theories, language, comfort zone, and constructive role. We look forward to further exploring how these trends manifest in our region, and identifying opportunities to maximize the potential of our region’s incredible assets to elevate the arts across a dynamic Massachusetts and nationally.</p>"
197,A Critical Piece in the Sustainability Puzzle,<p>Barr’s Director of Global Programs discusses a new framework developed by Barr grantee Global Footprint Network that will measure the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.</p>,"<p>Last week, as world leaders were gathering in New York at the United Nations for the launch of the <a href=""https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/topics"">new Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)</a>, I was making my way back from a site visit to cotton farmers in Gujarat, India.</p>

<p>In a plane at 30,000 feet over the deserts of Pakistan, I kept thinking about a painting I’d seen from the village of Tadameru, India, and how it manifests the link between the work of a Barr Global grantee, <a href=""http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/"">Global Footprint Network</a>, those efforts in New York at the UN, and real people in real places facing many obstacles imposed by unsustainable development. Here is a photo of the painting:</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/672/small.jpg?1642117308 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/672/medium.jpg?1642117308 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/672/large.jpg?1642117308 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/672/x_large.jpg?1642117308 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""Wall Art Work "" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/672/small.jpg?1642117308"" /> <div class=""FancyAttribution""> <p><a class=""FancyAttribution-link"" href=""http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/"">Global Footprint Network </a></p> </div> </div> </div></p>

<p>Tadameru is in the Kandhamal District, State of Odisha, India. The painting represents the community’s vision of the ideal village. The vision was developed based on a participatory process applying sustainable development metrics and tools introduced by Global Footprint Network. Note the abundance of water (from protected forests), the presence of good infrastructure (e.g., good school separated from good road), clear zones for different land use, all of which is currently lacking.</p>

<p>The Sustainable Development Goals define what as a world community we want to achieve within the next 15 years to ensure that we, our children, and future generations will be able to live great lives, regardless of income level, gender, or ethnicity.</p>

<p>The goals are a renewed and refined commitment for sustainable development around the globe, as originally formulated and committed to in 2000. While this is certainly a laudable commitment, many still question what this effort really means and how it will be measured.</p>

<p>Global Footprint Network has been at the forefront of developing the frameworks that help us understand what sustainable development really is and how it can be measured and monitored.</p>

<p>While the concept of <em>development</em> at a country level can be measured by using the <a href=""http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi"">United Nations Human Development Index</a>, the concept of <em>sustainability</em>, or what it means to live within the planetary resource boundaries, can be measured by the <a href=""http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/basics_introduction"">Ecological Footprint</a>.</p>

<p>Mathis Wackernagel is the inventor of this framework and Global Footprint Network is the organization he founded to promote the concept. The Ecological Footprint measures how much regenerative capacity a nation, state, city, or individual is using. For instance, it reveals that if everyone lived the lifestyle of the average American, we would need five planets.</p>

<p>A handful of progressive nations have already adopted the Ecological Footprint as a measure of their level of sustainability for their development. They use Global Footprint Network’s tools to determine their biocapacity use and they report on that alongside other measures such as income and health levels of their country (components of the Human Development Index).</p>

<p>While sustainable development is the ultimate goal, there are also many specific contributing goals. For example, goal 12.2 states that by 2030 the world will “achieve sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources.” And The Footprint has been proposed to specifically measure progress in achieving that goal over the next 15 years.</p>

<p>Of course it is actions which will bring about the change we seek. But, by having better and more specific tools to measure in a meaningful and understandable manner, what we want to (and must) achieve as a global community is one step closer.</p>

<p>Beyond providing general operating support to Global Footprint Network, Barr Foundation also provided funding to further develop and apply the Human Development Index (i.e., the Ecological Footprint Framework) as a tool at the community level. The goal was to allow individual villages in low-income countries to make decisions and monitor their own progress, and how to make their progress last.</p>

195,Dear 2015 Boston — A Dispatch From Your Future,"<p>I’ve been given the unique opportunity to write you a letter from your future city—Boston in the year 2050, to be exact.</p>","<p>Dear 2015,</p>

<p>It’s a very different place in a lot of ways, but not so much in the grand scheme of things. The city is now 420 years old, so what’s 35 years, really? In that span, as always, we’ve overcome challenges, stumbled, bounced back, and managed to retain our history and identity along the way. Fenway is about the same. It’s a rebuilding year for the Red Sox.</p>

<p>But in 2015, you find yourselves at a unique point in the city’s story. In the following 35 years, Boston will be integral in hitting the state’s 2050 goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent. I’m happy to report that you’ll pull it off, but it will mean huge shifts in how you coexist with your surroundings, how you get around, and where you live.</p>

<p>To help move things along, here’s a brief sneak preview (I can’t give away too much) of what Boston’s like in 2050, and then just a bit of advice.</p>
<h3>Living with the New Shoreline</h3>
<p>The first question you probably have about the future of Boston is, are we underwater? The answer is no. Well, mostly. While we’ve led some heroic climate change mitigation efforts, rising tides are an inevitable reality of life in the city. Our sea levels have crept up over the past 35 years, and continue to do so.</p>

<p>But Boston has a dynamic relationship with its waters. Back in 2015, more than half of downtown was filled-in tidelands. So we had to give a little of that land back to the harbor, but we’ve adapted.</p>

<p>Some of the ideas we put to work actually came about in your time, including resilient design plans from the <a href=""http://www.bostonlivingwithwater.org/"">Living with Water</a> competition that the Barr Foundation sponsored. We didn’t end up turning the city into Venice, exactly, but we did decide to embrace our changing shorelines, instead of retreating from them or trying to force the waters back.</p>

<p>Much of this adaptation involved retrofitting existing and historic buildings, sort of like hiking up our pant legs. But we also transformed many of the areas along the water into “resiliency districts,” establishing salt marshes, tidal pools, and oyster reefs along the shoreline. We’ve carved strategic canals to regulate the water levels when needed. These areas have become a draw for recreation, including a chain of green spaces that line and blend into the harbor.</p>

<p>The need to adapt also presented an opportunity to push the envelope of sustainable, resilient building. The city fast-tracked dense, mixed-use development that created an “urban seashore” designed to coexist with changing tides. New ultra-efficient buildings are carbon-neutral and rely on solar, wind, and wave energy installed along the harbor. We worked with nonprofit organizations like the <a href=""https://www.tpl.org/services/climate-smart-cities"">Trust for Public Land</a> to weave green infrastructure elements throughout the built environment. Most of these neighborhoods are car-free, but that’s not too unique these days.</p>
<h3>The future T</h3>
<p>I know the transit system was a mess in 2015, with debate over how to pay for a backlog of repairs, and whether the city should extend one section of one rail line. These budget fights live on today on some level. But around your time—starting with the <a href=""http://goboston2030.org/en/"">Go Boston 2030</a> planning process—we began to think of transportation, not in terms of a laundry list of problems, but of a vision for a better city.  We created a space to hear community needs, while also listening to emerging data and trends around the world, which invigorated long-term planning.  As a result, the reality of how we get around Boston in 2050 looks much different than it did in 2015.</p>

<p>The rail lines we heavily depended on in 2015 still thrive, but are just the skeleton of what’s become a mesh of bustling, multimodal routes that connect the city. As our population grew, it became clear that we needed to make politically difficult decisions in which single-occupancy vehicles ceded certain roads entirely to pedestrians, cyclists, and transit. This was a practical necessity, but also needed to reduce emissions—in 2015, transportation-related GHGs represented almost 40% of the state’s emissions.</p>

Yes, I’m sorry to say the storms you recently experienced were not the last, but today we have a much more fluid, adaptive transit system for when they hit.</p>

<p>Of course, cars are still around, but far fewer of them. A lot of people were losing their tastes for car ownership in 2015, and that trend continued. Pretty much all of the cars on the road today are self-driving (but you already knew that)—usually commercial shipping, mini-buses, or carpool vehicles operated by local companies. We used to see these private services as real threats to public transit, but cities have come to use them as tools, regulated and steered to fill gaps in hard-to-reach places.</p>

<p>Sure you can always take your own car if you want (electric of course, we stopped pumping gas in the ‘30s). But frankly, there are so many options, it’s a lot easier, cheaper, and more fun not to.</p>
<h3>There are a lot more of us</h3>
<p>As I’m sure you expected, there are far more Bostonians in 2050, approaching a million in the city proper. Our population has grown larger and more diverse than we even imagined in your time. And as the city changed, our challenge was to create a housing and transit mix in which people of all income levels and backgrounds would have a variety of options and thrive alongside each other.</p>

<p>Preparing for this level of change required tremendous foresight and smart planning, some of which took shape in your time as the city embarked on the collaborative planning process, <a href=""http://imagine.boston.gov/"">Imagine Boston 2030</a>.  We’ve spent a lot of the past 35 years building, building, building. Some building out; but mostly in and upwards.</p>

<p>The city adapted policies to clear the way and rezone for multi-family housing and mixed-use development, especially in the outlying areas as they hustled to keep up with the demand for better-connected communities. We also elevated neglected parts of the city to build whole new neighborhoods into the fabric of Boston—the new Widett Circle was a triumph from the aftermath of the Olympic bid—designed with the same sustainable and resilient principles we used on the Waterfront.</p>

<p>Boston is also a bit longer in the tooth in 2050. One in five households are headed by someone you’d call a senior, and we’re living and remaining active longer than ever. Many of us are downsizing to affordable units in compact city centers, right alongside young families and professionals, or in second or third residences built on formerly single-family properties (the term “in-law house” is frowned upon).</p>

<p>Keeping up was not easy. Housing 2050’s urban population is the biggest challenge ahead for you, with affordability in particular getting worse before it gets better. So to help you along the way:</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--for""> <p>advice</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>As you look to the next 35 years, know that just as cities will lead the way for nations, so will neighborhoods and their individual communities lead the way for cities like Boston.</p>

<p>Communities will display more innovation and leadership than ever. As cities grow and adapt for the future, there will be more decentralization of power grids and clean energy sources. Communities will take more control over other infrastructure like food production and water management. As climate change means harsher winters and hotter summers, local solutions will bubble up and replicate.</p>

<p>The strength of our individual places will allow Boston’s neighborhoods to pursue their own low carbon and livability solutions that will lead neighborhoods to discover that sustainability translates to tremendous economic benefits, but also a higher quality of daily life. Individual success stories will provide templates for other neighborhoods as they compete. Boston’s government agencies, nonprofits, and industry need to encourage and facilitate such development.</p>

<p>As things change, that same community strength will help the city preserve its identity and ensure equity. Public land trusts and community nonprofits can enable residents to acquire and maintain long-term affordable housing, and protect the character of neighborhoods. Thriving local artists will celebrate each area’s unique identity.</p>

<p>So there you have it Boston of 2015, my notes from the future. We’ve come a long way, and I’m not going to tell you it was easy. We still have a long way to go in my time. But as always, the city perseveres. Using the city’s wealth of innovation, ambition, and compassion, you’re on your way to a more resilient, livable, equitable Boston.</p>

193,Radio Silence Not Required,"<p>At Barr, we don’t think strategic planning requires going quiet until the work is done.</p>","<p>Strategic planning by foundations can often be opaque. That is why, during Barr’s planning efforts, we have strived for open and transparent communications. We want to minimize the mystery and keep our partners connected and apprised of our progress. In <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/an-update-on-our-planning-efforts"">my July update</a>, I noted our intention to finalize and share our strategic plans for Barr’s Arts &amp; Culture, Climate, and Education programs during the first quarter of 2016. I also emphasized that we will continue engaging and investing in efforts aligned with Barr’s current priorities, even while we plan for the future. To that end, we announced <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/announcing-6-5-million-in-new-grants"">$6.5 million in new grants</a> earlier today.</p>

<p>As a further expression of Barr’s aspiration to shed light on our planning work, we are initiating <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/about/our-planning"">a new blog series</a>. Beginning with this post, every few weeks until February 2016, Barr staff members will share important dimensions of our planning—key trends influencing the fields in which we are engaged; our perspectives about the strategic implications of these trends for Barr; and other themes that are emerging as we undertake this work.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--is""> <p>intention</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>We are, of course, planning a more comprehensive roll out of Barr’s strategies during the first quarter of 2016, but we view this series as an opportunity to bring greater transparency to the outcome of this work.</p>

<p>In my last update, I also described several common attributes guiding our planning. Among them is engaging outside perspectives to sharpen our thinking. For our Climate program, we assembled an advisory group to provide input to our program planning. During our most recent meeting, the group emphasized the importance of Barr being clear about its goals and priorities, but not becoming overly rigid about what we believe the path of change will look like—in other words, that we be firm on the ends, but more flexible as to the means. This is especially true in a field as complex and rapidly-changing as climate change, yet we think the advice will surely hold true across our other programs as well.</p>

<p>A final observation as we launch this series: when we refreshed Barr’s website earlier this year, we introduced a comments section on our blog to encourage visitors to engage and share their thoughts with us. Thus far, the feature has not gained much traction (this appears to be a challenge for many foundations). We hope that this new series will activate greater engagement and permit us to benefit from your ideas, reactions, and reflections. So, please, share your thoughts.</p>

<p>We look forward to doing our part to make the work of philanthropy just a little more open and accessible, and we appreciate your continued interest in the Barr Foundation.</p>

192,New Reports Offer Primer for Clean Energy Future,"<p>Amy Longsworth, director of the Boston Green Ribbon Commission, introduces a new series of reports to inform critical debates about the path to a cleaner, more reliable, more affordable energy future for our region.</p>","<p>Like other leading cities and states committed to addressing climate change, Boston and Massachusetts have pledged to reduce carbon emissions 80 percent by 2050. We know that, to reach that ambitious goal, future energy needs must be met almost entirely by clean, renewable sources—hydro, wind, and solar—not fossil fuels. But what is the path to get there? And what is our starting point?</p>

<p>To help understand and address these questions, on September 14, the <a href=""http://www.greenribboncommission.org"">Boston Green Ribbon Commission</a> released <a href=""http://www.greenribboncommission.org/GRC-Energy-Reports"">four new reports</a> providing a detailed look at how our region generates, transmits, purchases, and uses (and tries to use less) energy.

191,What Does It Take to Bring Good Ideas to Scale?,"<p>Chris Smith shares how the Summer Learning Project helped 6,500 Boston children return to school ready and motivated to learn.</p>","<p>The back-to-school season is a time of anticipation, excitement, and jitters. These feelings come to the surface for good reason: many young people struggle with the transition from the freedom of summer to the structure and expectations of the school year. Research shows that virtually all students lose some knowledge and skills over the summer, an effect known as “summer slide.” Yet, on average, low-income children slide further than their wealthier peers—exacerbating achievement gaps. </p>

<p>This fall in Boston, however, thousands of students are returning to school ready and motivated to learn. That’s because they were part of a “summer of learning,” as declared by Mayor Martin J. Walsh and Superintendent Tommy Chang. More than 6,500 Boston school children enrolled in 79 summer learning programs in diverse, non-traditional settings around the city as part of the Boston <a href=""http://bostonbeyond.org/summer-learning"">Summer Learning Project</a>.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--nearly""> <p>number</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>The mayor’s goal addresses an increasingly critical issue in today’s society—the well-documented gap in enrichment and learning opportunities between low-income youth and their wealthier peers. It also builds on the early positive findings of the most rigorous and comprehensive research to date on summer learning.</p>

<p>This call to action is six years in the making and reflects a high water mark for public recognition of the importance of summer learning in Boston and nationally. How did we get to this point? Six years ago, a group of funders, the City of Boston, the Boston Public Schools, and Boston After School &amp; Beyond, the organization that I run, saw an opportunity to unite some of Boston’s best summer programs to create a new model of learning that would focus on low-performing students in low-performing schools. This approach has resulted in thousands of new summer opportunities for students, increased capacity of summer programs, and actionable data on what is working for young people.</p>

<p>Even though there is much work ahead to meet the goal, the Barr Foundation, which has been one of the core supporters of this effort, invited me to reflect on how this idea has transformed from a discrete project to a citywide model. In my view, three ingredients proved essential to sustaining and growing this approach.</p>
<h3>1. A common goal</h3>
<p>An ambitious goal provides an opportunity for stakeholders to play to their strengths and collectively take on a new challenge. Over the past six years, Boston After School &amp; Beyond and the Boston Public Schools have united around the common goal of reversing learning loss during summer; improving skills associated with school, college, and career success; and deepening school-community partnerships. Since its inception in 2010, the Summer Learning Project, which we created together with the support of the Boston Opportunity Agenda, has created thousands of new seats to provide high-need students with engaging and enriching summer learning experiences.</p>

<p>A guiding principle informed this common goal: flexibility in implementation should be coupled with consistency in measuring results so that we can understand what is working and what needs improvement. This principle had a practical effect on engaging a broad array of programs under a single goal in a coordinated and measurable way.</p>
<h3>2. A model that draws on diversity</h3>
<p>Diversity strengthens a model, and a diverse student population necessitates a diverse array of programmatic approaches. That is why the mayor’s goal calls on the entire city to be part of a summer learning agenda. In making the case for his goal, Mayor Walsh explained that “our entire city can serve as a classroom” that will bring learning to life. The <a href=""https://bostonbeyond.org/summer-learning/"">79 programs</a> that are part of the 2015 Summer Learning Project reflect this city classroom. Natural reservations, the Harbor Islands, the Zoo, colleges, workplaces, sports and arts programs, neighborhood-based organizations, and others have a role to play.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--work""> <p>href</p> </blockquote></p>
<h3>3. A commitment to continuous learning and improvement</h3>
<p>Since the beginning, all organizations in the Summer Learning Project have been dedicated to a common measurement and quality improvement agenda—enabling partners to put their best foot forward, learn from one another, and create new knowledge for the field, locally and nationally. For example, all organizations, regardless of their resources or approach, measure program quality and student progress using the same tools and the same metrics. This helps programs to see their relative strengths and weaknesses and allows all of us to see citywide trends across programs.</p>

<p>Additionally, Boston readily engaged in the most rigorous and comprehensive study ever on summer learning, commissioned by The Wallace Foundation and evaluated by the RAND Corporation.  RAND’s <a href=""http://www.wallacefoundation.org/knowledge-center/summer-and-extended-learning-time/extended-learning-time/Pages/Ready-for-Fall.aspx""><em>Ready for Fall?</em></a> report shows that participants in summer programs gained a significant advantage in mathematics performance over their peers come fall.</p>

<p>In this national context, Boston’s effort stood out for its creative and strategic partnerships, linking schools with a much broader array of expertise, resources, and learning settings than would typically be found in a summer school experience.</p>

190,Pope Rallies Mayors to Lead on Climate Change,"<p>Following his new Encyclical on the urgency for action on climate, and with global talks on the horizon, Pope Francis gathered leaders from cities that are already taking up the challenge.</p>","<p>This July, the largest-ever group of city mayors met at the Vatican to discuss with Pope Francis one of the most pressing challenges in our day—climate change. Among the mayors in attendance were several members of the <a href=""http://usdn.org/public/Carbon-Neutral-Cities.html"">Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance</a> (including Boston), a collaboration of global cities committed to achieving aggressive long-term carbon reduction goals, and supported by five foundations, including Barr. </p>

<p>Leadership on climate at the city level has never been more critical. Cities are essential to combating climate change as they are home to more than half of humanity and are responsible for nearly three quarters of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions worldwide. “Climate change calls on societies to act quickly and cities tend to be more nimble than national governments,” said Pope Francis—a notion echoed by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in his recent piece, <a href=""https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2015-08-18/city-century?campaign=city"">“Why Municipalities Are the Key to Fighting Climate Change.”</a></p>

<p>The Pope called for the meeting following his May 24 Encyclical on ecology and climate change, <em>Laudato Si</em>, which set out to frame a new discourse about caring for our “common home.”  The July discussion focused on how cities, along with faith-based and other community leaders, can cooperate to most effectively address climate. Pope Francis called for a redoubling of efforts in the run-up to the <a href=""https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/summit"">UN Conference on Sustainable Development</a> in New York City in September and <a href=""http://www.cop21paris.org"">COP 21</a> in Paris in December, and he vowed to bring this message with him when he meets with President Obama on September 23, Congress on September 24, and the UN General Assembly on September 25th.</p>

<p>The Vatican meeting resulted in a <a href=""http://www.pass.va/content/dam/scienzesociali/booklet/declaration21july2015.pdf"">declaration</a> signed by the Pope and mayors committing to significantly reduce climate pollution and improve the health and resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations. Signed by mayors from South America, Africa, the United States, Europe, and Asia, the declaration asserts the Paris summit “may be the last effective opportunity to negotiate arrangements that keep human-induced warming below two degrees centigrade,” and that “human-induced climate change is a scientific reality, and its effective control is a moral imperative for humanity.”</p>

<p>Achieving the dramatic GHG reductions required to avoid grave ecosystem disruption and serious human health impacts will require a fundamental, transformational redesign of the way we develop and operate urban systems. Fortunately, the cities in the Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance are well underway, building the roadmaps for how this can be done in ways that preserve and enrich life for all who share this “common home.”</p>

189,Meet the Newest Member of Barr’s Arts Team,<p>A conversation with Jaime Cortez.</p>,"<p>Earlier this month, we welcomed <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/people/jaime-cortez"">Jaime Cortez</a> as Barr’s new program officer for Arts &amp; Culture. With experience as a grantmaker, educator, artist, and activist in a career that spans more than twenty years in the field, Jaime brings terrific perspective and insight to this new role. He has dived right in—listening and learning, visiting with grantees, and taking in varied arts offerings from across the region. At a pause in this full agenda, I peppered Jaime with a few questions to help give a better sense of our new colleague:</p>
<h4>What drew you from San Francisco to this opportunity in Boston?</h4>
<p>I had the sense that Barr’s arts and culture program was at an exciting moment in its evolution—with an opportunity to help shape its future direction in the context of strategic planning. In addition, through <a href=""http://www.bostoncreates.org"">Boston Creates</a>, the whole city is engaging in a process to rethink how it sees and prioritizes art and to be bold and ambitious about its future. It is clearly an exciting time for arts here.</p>
<h4>As Boston undertakes its cultural planning process, what are some things that are really working well in San Francisco that might be worth a look here?</h4>
<p><div class=""Media -aside -left""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img alt=""Jaime Cortez Headshot "" class=""Media-image"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/618/crop_preview.jpg?1642117155"" /> </div> </div></p>

<p>One interesting practice that San Francisco committed to is having cultural centers serving specific districts and communities or partnering with local venues to present arts programs. I found it really exciting to see what happens when art comes into the neighborhoods. Residents don’t need to travel to the city center or visit a museum to experience art. It’s a powerful idea that access to art should be simplified—accessible on a neighborhood’s terms, honoring the neighborhood’s culture.</p>
<h4>How does being an artist influence your work?</h4>
<p>I’ve been a working artist and an arts teacher. I’ve worked at arts nonprofits and in university arts programs.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--all""> <p>through</p> </blockquote></p>

<p>The way I think about and approach my work draws on all of those experiences, and somehow thrives at the intersection of those different experiences.</p>
<h4>What are some of the art exhibits you’ve already seen and enjoyed?</h4>
<p>I recently got to visit the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and was excited by the quality of work there. One photography exhibit in particular really struck me—it’s called <a href=""http://www.mfa.org/exhibitions/in-the-wake"">“In the Wake”</a> and is a series where photographers respond to 3/11, the day of the great earthquake and tsunami in East Japan. It’s worth a visit.</p>

<p>I was also really interested in our recent visit to <a href=""http://www.fab11.org"">FabFest</a>, an international gathering of people involved with the FabLab movement—a disruptive movement out of MIT, where labs give people access to high-tech equipment (3D printers, laser cutters, etc.) and let the creativity unfold.</p>
<h4>Who is one of your favorite artists right now?</h4>
<p>I love humor in art. My humor hero is a visual artist named Maurizio Cattelan. He is known for his satirical sculptures like an elevator the size of mice, or putting up the iconic Hollywood sign on a hill above Palermo, Italy, next to the municipal dump, or a nine-foot-tall sculpture of a cat skeleton rearing its back. Early in his career, Cattelan was invited to create an art installation for the Museum Boymans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam. For the piece, he tore a hole in the floor of the museum and created <a href=""https://www.perrotin.com/Maurizio_Cattelan-works-oeuvres-19603-2.html"">a sculpture of himself peering out from the hole</a>. It was his trickster way of showing that he is in the museum, but somehow shouldn’t be there.</p>
<h4>When you told people you were leaving San Francisco for Boston, what did they say?</h4>
<p>When I decided to come to Boston, memories of the city’s historic winter were still fresh. My California friends and colleagues asked me, “Are you sure you’re ready for this?”</p>"
188,A New Cohort of Barr Fellows Commences with Learning Journey,"<p>Barr’s director of grants management, Kerri Hurley, reflects on travels through Bolivia with the 2015 Barr Fellows.</p>","<p>Last fall, we <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/announcing-the-2015-barr-fellows"">announced a new group of Barr Fellows</a>—our fifth since 2005—though the Fellowship experience does not officially begin until they embark on a group trip to the global south. Designed to immerse them in an entirely new learning context, the learning journey allows Fellows to interact with social change leaders who, often despite scarce resources and great challenges, provide new ways of thinking to inspire Fellows’ own work back home. Earlier cohorts of Barr Fellows began their experiences with trips to South Africa, Zimbabwe, Brazil, and Haiti. The 2015 Barr Fellowship commenced with a trip to Bolivia this past June.</p>

<p>For the Fellows, this initial experience is followed by a three-month sabbatical and three years of periodic retreats, professional development, and the opportunity to join the broader network of Barr Fellows. The Fellowship is both recognition of the outstanding contributions a group of leaders has made within their communities, as well as an investment in their leadership to drive positive change in the years to come.</p>

<p>I had the privilege of joining the 2015 Barr Fellows on their learning journey to Bolivia, which is one of South America’s poorest countries—yet is rich with cultural heritage and natural beauty. There are more than 36 officially recognized indigenous groups and 69 distinct ecosystems. While we didn’t have time to explore all of it, over two weeks we covered quite a bit, spending several days each in Cochabamba, La Paz, El Alto, Uyuni, Potosi, Sucre, and Rurrenabaque.</p>

<p>One of the most memorable experiences for me was during our visit to the capital city of La Paz, which stands 12,000 feet above sea level. There we had the opportunity to work alongside an amazing team from the nonprofit <a href=""http://www.alternativascc.org"">Fundacion Alternativas</a>. Dedicated to enhancing food security for the urban poor, Fundacion Alternativas works closely with youth and residents to improve access to food and urban food production.</p>

<p>During our visit, we learned that more than 60% of the population in La Paz lives below the poverty line. In addition, chronic malnutrition affects <a href=""http://www.who.int/whr/2007/en"">nearly 30%</a> of indigenous children. In this context, Fundacion Alternativas transformed a large government-owned plot of land that was plagued by drug use, sexual assaults, and other criminal activities. With 20 families, they terraced the property and turned the space into a community garden.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/606/small.jpg?1642117124 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/606/medium.jpg?1642117124 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/606/large.jpg?1642117124 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/606/x_large.jpg?1642117124 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""Garden in Bolivia "" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/606/small.jpg?1642117124"" /> </div> </div></p>

<p>The families in this community take great pride in their garden plots, which yield crops like broccoli, chard, lettuce, carrots, cilantro, beans, onions, radishes, and potatoes. These crops supplement their diets and provide a model of what communities can look like. They have created such a welcoming and beautiful oasis that families in the community come just to partake in its beauty, to spend the day knitting, and to enjoy the company of friends and family as others tend their gardens.</p>

<p>The program has become so popular that there is a long waiting list for families. To help meet some of that pent-up demand, we had the opportunity to build raised beds for 20 additional families. We carried logs down the side of the cliff, sawed them to the appropriate sizes, and then cut and twisted wire to hold the beds together. The Fellows organized into an assembly line, each of us figuring out where we could be most useful and giving it our all. Up until that point, we had been mostly observing, listening, and learning. It felt wonderful to use our hands and to do something in return for all the kindness we’d received.</p>

<p>When it was time to leave that wonderful hillside, we all sat on the ground and shared food, hugs, and even a few tears. For me, it was one of the most meaningful experiences of the trip—one that created a new bond that only grew during the remainder of the trip. </p>

<p>I am so grateful to the Barr Foundation for providing me with this opportunity to step away from my work in the office—and to my colleague Christi Craig who so capably kept all the grants management trains moving on time in my absence. My thanks also to the 2015 Barr Fellows for their unwavering support and friendship on our journey together so far from home. I am appreciative and humbled by the beautiful people of Bolivia for their warmth and kindness. ¡Vivir Bien!</p>

<p>The Fellows are now setting off or have already begun their three-month sabbaticals. We look forward to hearing and sharing more stories and reflections from them following their return.</p>"
187,Why Art Should Imitate the New America,<p>National trends and demographic data shared by Dr. Manuel Pastor continue to resonate with the Boston arts community.</p>,"<p>Weeks later, the sentiments of <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/how-to-keep-audience-next-from-clicking-unsubscribe"">Dr. Manuel Pastor’s presentation on “Arts and a Changing Boston”</a> are still reverberating in the arts community. Writer Spencer Shannon, who attended Dr. Pastor’s talk, pointed out a direct connection between the insights shared during Pastor’s visit this spring and current events in the Boston theater scene in her article <a href=""http://howlround.com/being-real-a-rey-pamatmat-and-the-new-american-identity"">“Being Real: A. Rey Pamatmat and the New American Identity”</a> for the national theater commons <a href=""http://howlround.com"">HowlRound</a>.</p>

<p>The jumping-off point for her piece came from the Boston premieres of two plays by A. Rey Pamatmat. Pamatmat, a Filipino-American playwright who grew up in rural Michigan, includes Filipino characters in nearly all of his plays because this truthfully reflects America and its people. The plays sparked a heated debate when an early review suggested that the race of the characters was not emphasized enough, and others pointed out that a character’s race does not need to be the centerpiece of a work. Shannon outlines the need for new American plays to reflect the changing America that Dr. Pastor’s demographic data highlighted; theatres should be producing stories that more accurately reflect the lives of Americans, most of whom, by 2040, will not be white.</p>

<p>In her assessment of the American theater scene, Shannon also echoed Dr. Pastor’s point that everyone should have a stake in the artistic and cultural life of a community. Art is a crucial part of how we see our world, allowing us to embrace and interpret our collective identity. Art connects us and inherent in this connection is the responsibility to include all voices. This is easier said than done, and missteps are common. Yet many arts organizations are doing good work to be more relevant to new audiences. In a <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/boston-arts-audience-diversification"">recent blog post</a>, both Lyric Stage Company Artistic Director Spiro Veloudos and Huntington Theatre Managing Director Michael Maso shared about progress in this vein. And we look forward to featuring more examples of arts organizations bringing effective practices to Boston.</p>

<p>In addition, the City of Boston is consciously trying to incorporate voices from all Boston neighborhoods in its cultural planning process, <a href=""http://www.bostoncreates.org"">Boston Creates</a>. Community conversations are in full swing across the city, providing a forum for people to weigh in on what should be Boston’s cultural priorities.</p>

<p>Dr. Pastor’s talk was timely for Barr as well. As the Foundation engages in its <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/an-update-on-our-planning-efforts"">own planning efforts</a>, we want to ensure that our thinking is sharpened by external perspectives like Dr. Pastor’s and that we are responsive to a changing region.</p>

186,“How New Audiences Came Through our Doors”,<p>The leaders of two Boston-based theaters share what they’ve learned from successful efforts to diversify audiences. </p>,"<p>Though arts organizations face many common challenges, opportunities to collaborate with peers on ways to address them are few. Changing this dynamic is one of the reasons the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/arts-creativity/barr-klarman-arts-capacity-building"">Barr-Klarman Arts Capacity Building Initiative</a> was structured to provide support to cohorts of arts and cultural organizations—which worked together to identify challenges they were interested in trying to tackle together. One of several topics identified early on was how to diversify audiences.</p>

<p>Since the cohorts first came together in 2012, they have begun working on this issue, testing and sharing strategies, and, in several cases, seeing some real breakthroughs. Recently, we invited Spiro Veloudos of the Lyric Stage Company and Michael Maso of the Huntington Theatre Company to share more about what they did, what has worked well, and what they have learned over the last few years.</p>

<h4>Tell us about your audience before you began this work?</h4>
<p>This isn’t actually an easy thing to measure. Though, as a baseline, our audience members of color accounted for a little more than four percent (4%) of our total audience.</p>
<h4>What was your strategy to increase that number?</h4>
<p>I focused first and foremost on programming, as that’s what I have the most control over, so that more people see themselves and their stories being portrayed onstage. In addition to choosing plays by African-American, Asian-American, and Latino playwrights, I have also worked hard to practice inclusive casting, where we take opportunities to build companies of actors more reflective of Boston’s diversity. This was most prevalent in the Lyric’s award-winning production of Sondheim’s <em>Into the Woods</em> (featured above).</p>
<h4>What were your goals with the effort?</h4>
<p>Our hopes were that by doing a better job of reflecting all the citizens of Boston onstage, the Lyric Stage would in turn become a more welcoming and inclusive environment. We wanted to capitalize on our inclusive casting by recruiting more black, Latino, and Asian-American board members, as well as attracting a more diverse audience.</p>
<h4>What worked well?</h4>
<p>I am very proud of our programming, which is also reflected in subtle ways, like featuring two African-American actresses on the cover of our new season brochure, or intentionally showcasing a variety of faces in our audience response videos. I think we’re doing a good job of sending a message that we are a theatre interested in stories that can appeal to all of the residents of Boston.</p>
<h4>What didn’t work?</h4>
<p>We still aren’t seeing dramatic changes in our audience and recognize that this work takes time. This time last year, we shifted gears somewhat to put more focus on building relationships with organizations that represent Chinatown and Roxbury. Our long-term hope is that we can collaborate and create more programming in those communities from which we hope our next audience emerges.</p>
<h4>Other reflections, advice for arts organizations?</h4>
<p>We’re moving farther and farther from the word “diversity.” The more conversations we had with people of color, the more we found that diversity was a word few were passionate about, whereas, being inclusive is a message we all feel strongly about. We’ve also expanded our definition of inclusivity. For example, we’re very proud of the fact that three of six directors next season will be women. We’re making efforts to hire more carpenters and electricians who are women or people of color.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -aside -left""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img alt=""Michael Maso headshot"" class=""Media-image"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/569/crop_preview.jpg?1642117073"" /> </div> <div class=""Media-caption""> <p>Maso</p> </div> </div></p>
<h4>Tell us about your audience before you began this work?</h4>
<p>In our 2010–2011 season, the Huntington’s audience was 8.3% non-white. Four years later, through a variety of strategies, the number is 13.5%. In that same time period our audience under age 35 rose from 8.8% to 11.8%.</p>
<h4>Talk about your strategies to increase those numbers.</h4>
<p>The Huntington has two core strategies to diversify audiences: pricing and programming. That means a continued commitment to programming plays by and about communities of color and new pricing initiatives for young people and people with limited incomes. For example, in January 2012 we launched the Community Membership Program, offering low-income theatre lovers a free membership through more than 150 partner organizations serving traditionally low-income households. This membership allows them to purchase any available seat to any performance of any production for $20. We also have our “35 Below” program that provides young people with tickets for $30.</p>
<h4>What were your goals with the effort?</h4>
<p>Our primary goal is to reduce the impact of price as a barrier to participation, and we also want to give lower-income audience members control over when and with whom they come to the theatre. Though the price they pay is greatly reduced, they are still valued customers and receive the same customer service as those paying much higher prices. We surmised that by expanding the economic makeup of our audience we would also expand ethnic diversity, which seems to have been successful. Of our 2,300 current Community Members, 59% are ethnically or racially diverse.</p>
<h4>What worked well?</h4>
<p>Appointing a dedicated Community Membership Coordinator as liaison with our partner organizations was a critical step in this process, building trust in the many communities we are trying to serve. For our 35 Below program, a series of “wrap parties” at Huntington shows and gatherings at non-Huntington shows helped build awareness of the program. </p>
<h4>What have you learned?</h4>
<p>We are always working to increase frequency of participation among younger and more diverse audience members, despite all the competition for their leisure time, and the expansion of a racially diverse audience to a wider range of productions.</p>
<h4>Other reflections, advice for others trying to do more and better with new audiences?</h4>
<p>Aligning programming with your target audience is the single most important aspect of any effort to expand reach. And while partnerships are not easy, collaborations with other organizations that share your goals and values can be very productive. </p>

185,Northeast Energy Program Lifting Economies and Lowering Emissions,<p>New report shows states participating in most recent phase of regional carbon cap-and-trade are experiencing significant economic benefits while dramatically reducing emissions.</p>,"<p>A $1.3-billion boost to their economies. 14,000 new jobs. $460 million in savings from lower electricity and heating bills. According to a new report by <a href=""http://www.analysisgroup.com"">The Analysis Group</a>, an economic research firm, these are among the benefits enjoyed by the nine Northeast states that participated in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) from 2012 through 2014.</p>

<p>RGGI is the first market-based regulatory program in the U.S. to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Participating states collectively set a cap for carbon emissions allowed from the power sector and sell these through auctions. Proceeds are then invested in a variety of ways—determined by each state—and typically include energy efficiency, renewable energy, and other consumer benefit programs. Since the program’s inception, it has contributed to a decrease of 33% in carbon emissions. The infographic below features the key elements and impacts of the program through 2014.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/534/small.jpg?1642116987 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/534/medium.jpg?1642116987 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/534/large.jpg?1642116987 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/534/x_large.jpg?1642116987 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""RGGI Infographic"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/534/small.jpg?1642116987"" /> </div> </div></p>

<p>The report also found that RGGI has helped keep more dollars circulating in the local economy, as the amount of money sent outside the region to pay for imported energy has dropped. RGGI reduced dollars flowing out of state to pay for fossil fuels imported from outside the region by more than $1.27 billion  from 2012 through 2014. Meanwhile, the states’ use of RGGI auction proceeds has boosted the purchase of goods and services in the regional economy, for everything from solar panels and insulation to engineering services for energy audits to labor for efficiency retrofits.</p>

<p>Barr joined a diverse group of funders to support this report, including the Merck Family Fund, the Energy Foundation, The Thomas W. Haas Foundation at the NH Charitable Foundation, Sandy Buck, Fritz and Susan Onion, Seal Bay Fund, Anna Marie and John Thron, Peter Lamb, and the Orchard Foundation. Next month, the Environmental Protection Agency will finalize its Clean Power Plan, which aims to limit carbon emissions from power plants. As states across the country consider how best to respond, this new report makes it clear RGGI is worth a look and that it is possible to meet emissions goals in ways that also strengthen local economies. </p>

184,An Update On Our Planning Efforts,<p>What to expect in the months ahead at Barr.</p>,"<p>In all its splendor, summer has now arrived in Boston, happily relegating to memory our historic winter. And for us at Barr, this represents a time where we are planning for the future as we simultaneously continue working to advance the Foundation’s current priorities.</p>

<p>My post here focuses on our program planning activities and anticipated timeline. In earlier blog posts, I outlined <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/from-the-president-december-2014"">key decisions made by our trustees</a>, which provide the foundation upon which this planning builds. In this context, I have three key messages to share at this time.</p>
<h4>Barr is actively pursuing current priorities while we plan</h4>
<p>First, and most importantly, even as we are engaged in this planning work across Barr, we are committed to remaining active in support of our current priorities. To that end, last month we announced <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/announcing-10-million-in-new-grants"">$10 million in grants approved</a> by our trustees, bringing total approvals for 2015 to $24 million as of mid-year. We firmly believe that planning for the future should not inhibit our capacity to remain an engaged, constructive partner related to our existing priorities and, by year-end, we project approving grants totaling $55 million.</p>
<h4>A common set of attributes will guide our planning</h4>
<p>Second, while our approach to planning within each of our core programs will be customized, certain attributes will be consistent across the Foundation. We recognize that each program is at a different stage of its evolution. There are also varying levels of research, data, and analysis required across areas as diverse as arts and culture, climate, and education. At the same time, all that we do at Barr is guided by a single <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/from-the-president-january-2015"">mission</a>, a set of <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/from-the-president-fall-2014"">core values</a>, and a <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/about/#approach"">common approach to philanthropy</a>. Accordingly, we have identified a set of common attributes that are guiding the planning across the Foundation:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Focused on impact</strong>: Our principal focus is on how Barr can drive positive impact, consistent with our mission, values, and approach.</li>
<li><strong>Responsive to environment</strong>: We aim to align plans to our best understanding of the current context and opportunities in each of our programs.</li>
<li><strong>Taking a long view</strong>: We embrace a long-term perspective, considering how Barr can serve as both an effective steward and catalyst for years to come.</li>
<li><strong>Sharpened by external perspectives</strong>: We are engaging outside perspectives to challenge and deepen our thinking and guard against insularity.</li>
<li><strong>Aiming to be bold</strong>: We seek to develop bold, aspirational plans that will balance rigor and flexibility.</li>
<li><strong>Recognizing the power of communications</strong>: Our plans will integrate communications as a key tool to advance our goals.</li>
</ul>

<p>We share these attributes to provide some insight into how we are approaching this important work and to preview what you might anticipate as outcomes of our planning effort. We also hope you will hold us accountable to these aspirations.</p>
<h4>Plans will be rolled out in early 2016</h4>
<p>Finally, a word about our timeline. We anticipate sharing Barr’s future plans for our Arts &amp; Culture, Climate, and Education programs during the first quarter of 2016. As I have <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/from-the-president-may-2015"">communicated before</a>, these plans will certainly build upon existing areas of focus. Change at Barr will be evolutionary, not revolutionary. We do not seek radical reinvention for its own sake. Yet, we do aim to bring greater focus, coherence, and consistency to the work across the Foundation, in service to our mission and oriented toward impact. Where shifts in priorities lead us to wind down aspects of Barr’s current work, we commit to open communications and active engagement with our partners to ensure a thoughtful, respectful transition.</p>

<p>No doubt this is a period of change at Barr.

183,National and Local Supporters Rally Behind Boston’s Disconnected Youth,"<p>$810,000 in national funding helps stalled high school graduates jump start their future.</p>","<p>In Boston, <a href=""http://bostonopportunityyouth.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/BostonOYC_InitialResearch.pdf"">about 12,000</a> young people between the ages of 16 and 24 are neither going to school nor working.  Educators and advocates call these young people “opportunity youth” because they represent tremendous untapped social and economic potential. Without the necessary education and training needed to secure stable employment, these youth and their families have difficult futures ahead of them.</p>

<p>And it’s not only the young people and their families who are affected by this untapped potential. Studies show that each opportunity youth, over the course of a lifetime, creates a social burden of <a href=""http://www.aspeninstitute.org/sites/default/files/content/docs/resources/Economic_Value_of_Opportunity_Youth_Report.pdf"">about $700,000</a>, which includes lost gross earnings, additional health expenditures, crime-related costs, and welfare and social-service expenditures.</p>

<p>So, how can we connect these youth to pathways that lead to educational attainment and stable careers? A national effort to build stronger support systems and improve outcomes for opportunity youth recently reached Boston, and in no small way.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, <a href=""http://www.jff.org/"">Jobs for the Future (JFF)</a> and the <a href=""https://www.aspeninstitute.org/programs/forum-for-community-solutions/"">Aspen Institute Forum for Community Solutions</a> awarded the <a href=""http://www.bostonpic.org/"">Boston Private Industry Council (PIC)</a> and the <a href=""http://www.tbf.org/tbf/81/BOA"">Boston Opportunity Agenda</a>, as co-conveners of the <a href=""http://bostonopportunityyouth.org/"">Boston Opportunity Youth Collaborative (OYC)</a>, an $810,000 grant. With these resources, the OYC will focus on addressing a key gap in services for older opportunity youth who have a high school credential but are not going to school or working.</p>

<p>According to Census data, 72% of Boston’s opportunity youth population has attained at least a high-school equivalency degree. The fact that the opportunity youth population skews in this manner can largely be attributed to the robust dropout prevention and recovery system that Boston has developed over the past decade. Through the efforts of the <a href=""http://www.bostonpic.org/policy/youth-transitions"">Youth Transitions Task Force</a>, another multi-stakeholder partnership convened by the PIC, the high-school dropout rate in Boston Public Schools has fallen from 8.4% in 2004 to 3.8% in 2014, a historic low for the district.</p>

<p>With JFF-Aspen funding from the <a href=""http://www.nationalservice.gov/programs/social-innovation-fund"">Social Innovation Fund (SIF)</a> and matching contributions from local funders, the OYC recently launched a <a href=""http://www.x-celeducation.org/connection-center/"">Connection Center</a> in Roxbury where older opportunity youth can go to have their interests and options assessed, then get connected to training, education, and career opportunities. The OYC is also working with multiple partner programs to provide college bridging and navigation support, employment coaching and referrals, and job training. The Connection Center will serve more than 450 opportunity youth over the next three years.</p>

<p>The Barr Foundation joined this effort because we recognize the need for focused investment in efforts to build a system for disconnected youth. Given that building such a system requires a comprehensive and collaborative approach, we believe that Boston is better positioned now more than ever to build a multi-stakeholder system for opportunity youth. The OYC has effectively aligned the city’s major credit recovery, GED, high-school equivalency, and college bridge programs around a set of goals and strategies. With funding from JFF-Aspen, the OYC now has the resources and national validation needed to keep local stakeholders at the table.</p>

<p>Barr, Hyams Foundation, United Way, the Boston Foundation, Balfour Foundation, and other peers have eagerly responded to the match requirements for the JFF-Aspen grant. Few efforts in Boston find local funders rallying around an initiative so responsively. We are optimistic that this effort will build an effective system of supports that helps Boston’s opportunity youth realize their full potential.</p>

181,1970s Zoning Calling Your Shots? Not This Boston Suburb,"<p>By huge margins, Winchester just voted to change the antiquated zoning laws many Massachusetts towns assume are untouchable.</p>","<p>Winchester, Massachusetts, has the kind of picturesque New England town center that both planners and movie directors dream about: several walkable blocks of Victorian brick buildings, a white-steepled church on a leafy common, and a commuter rail station with 10-minute service to downtown Boston.</p>

<p>The problem is that that the town center has been stuck in time like an old TV show. Its zoning rules are 40 years old. As a consequence, except for two small developments—11 luxury condos and a mini strip mall with a parking lot out front—nothing new has been built in the town center in over 30 years and, with limited foot traffic, local businesses struggle to stay afloat.</p>

<p>Worse still, rising housing prices threaten to close the door on both the young people who grew up in town, as well as the aging Boomers who raised families there. The median home price rose to nearly $1,000,000 in 2015, and there are few rental apartments.</p>

<p>Reforming local zoning rules is one of the most challenging, laborious, and uncertain endeavors in Massachusetts. The fact that zoning changes require a two-thirds “supermajority” vote to pass raises the stakes—and the risk that years of work will be in vain. This is one of the reasons why Massachusetts struggles to build the housing and walkable places we desperately need.</p>

<p>Yet, just a few weeks ago, Winchester took a bold step to change course by approving significant re-zoning of its Center Business District. Much of the groundwork was laid over the last four years through the <a href=""http://ma-smartgrowth.org/gn"">Massachusetts Smart Growth Alliance’s Great Neighborhoods</a> program, supported by the Barr Foundation and the <a href=""http://www.fordfoundation.org"">Ford Foundation</a>.</p>

<p>Great Neighborhoods is based on the idea that the best way to transform a place is to transform the way people work together.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/505/small.jpg?1642116897 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/505/medium.jpg?1642116897 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/505/large.jpg?1642116897 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/505/x_large.jpg?1642116897 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""Winchester Town Meeting "" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/505/small.jpg?1642116897"" /> </div> </div></p>

<p>Winchester was one of five flagship communities when the program launched in 2011. From the perspective of the Alliance, Winchester was a notoriously difficult community for development and an intriguing challenge. Until the mid-2000s, it had no planner on staff and had a lot of catching up to do. As a first step, the Planning Board and Town Planner Brian Szekely worked with the Alliance to develop a work plan that laid out long-term objectives for the town center and set a medium-term goal of changing local zoning. Alongside other support, the Alliance contracted experts to study floodplain issues, zoning, and historic preservation guidelines, and to develop communications recommendations.</p>

<p>Fast forward four years and what had seemed like a long shot turned out to be a slam dunk—the new zoning passed nearly unanimously. “The town meeting vote came in at 136-9,” said Planning Board Chairwoman Betsy Cregger. “The vote was overwhelming and a bit of a shock. We couldn’t have been happier.”</p>

<p>The new zoning for Winchester’s Center Business District will make it worlds easier to advance the kinds of projects local businesses know they need to thrive, including more housing and mixed-use buildings to increase foot traffic—and including more affordable housing that makes it possible for young people and retirees to stay in the town they love.  </p>

<p>The Town owns a key parcel of land next to the train station, which could become the first new mixed-use transit-oriented development project. Property owners see potential to convert gas stations or strip plazas to higher density, and even older buildings that are currently single-story could be restored to their original three or four-story height with housing and office space above retail.</p>

<p>“Until new developments occur, there is little information that would tell us it’s a true success,” he continued. “However, there have been several town center property owners who have already come into the Planning Department with their architects to determine the best course of action, so there is definite interest in what we’re trying to accomplish.”</p>

<p>This was a big win for Winchester, and a terrific model for other towns wanting to unleash the potential of their downtowns.  Along the way, many factors and many actors contributed to success. I’ll highlight three that stand out for me:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Use visuals to inspire and make the possibilities tangible.</strong>
One of the key decisions in the campaign was to invite three architectural firms to create designs for a Town-owned parking lot next to the train station that exemplified the walkable, mixed-use growth that Winchester envisioned. On display at a series of public meetings, this work helped residents and businesses visualize the real possibilities and generated enthusiasm.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Be clear about goals, and communicate them many times, in many ways.</strong>
“In the end,” said Town Planner Brian Szekely, “it came down to communicating our goals and showing how the zoning code reflected those goals. Getting the word out was one of the most important keys to our success. Leading up to Town Meeting, we had a webpage, used social media, held five community meetings in three months, as well as several newspaper articles that helped get our points across to many people in many different formats.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Go for all, all, and all.</strong>
“The best part of the process for me was getting all of the boards and committees who are involved with the Center Business District to actually start talking with each other,” said Town Planner Brian Szekely.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>“In many of the meetings, whether it was the Design Review Committee, or the Historical Commission, or the Housing Partnership Board, there was a level of confidence that we all had when speaking with the public because we came off as a united front. All were involved, all participated, and although we had different goals, we all met in the middle.”</p>

Participants represented a cross-section of nonprofits, philanthropy, consulting, education, and B corps—from chief executives to development and communications directors to evaluation, program, and policy officers and associates. Significantly, Threads Boston drew more millennials than any other Threads event thus far.  </p>

<p>This was a particularly timely conversation in Boston, given the amount of change taking place here and across the Commonwealth, particularly leadership changes in government, schools, and a host of nonprofit and philanthropic institutions. As Barr Foundation President Jim Canales noted in his brief remarks to open the day, these and other changes present great opportunities for new conversations and ways of working together.  </p>

178,Bus Rapid Transit May Put “Transit Excellence” in Reach,"<p>With our quality of life, economy, and climate all on the line, BRT deserves a closer look.</p>","<p>When Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker appointed a special commission to diagnose the MBTA’s ailments earlier this year, he shared a sentiment that surely had many of us nodding our heads.</p>

<p>“We cannot continue to do the same thing and expect a different result,” Governor Baker said.</p>

<p>If there’s one thing Massachusetts learned from the record storms we endured this winter, it’s that there are fundamental weaknesses in our transportation system. Simply placing band-aids on its wounds will not be enough. And even if we catch up on the immense backlog of maintenance, upgrades, and repairs we’ve been putting off for too long, the best we can hope for is a system that runs as well as it did in the 1960s and ’70s. And, as Harry Mattison rightly noted in a March op-ed in the <em>Boston Globe</em>, the “economy, environment, and quality of life for everyone in Greater Boston” depend not on band-aids, but on our reaching for “transit excellence.”</p>

<p>We believe one of the keys to that transit excellence will be Bus Rapid Transit (or “BRT”), a novel mode of transportation widely implemented abroad and steadily gaining momentum in the United States. In several world-class cities, BRT has combined exclusive, physically separated lanes, enclosed stations, pre-paid fare collection, and smart use of real-time data to rival the speed, capacity, and comfort of the best rail lines.</p>

<p>High-capacity BRT vehicles cut through traffic using exclusive lanes, but don’t suffer the disadvantage of being locked into rail lines. They can travel freely on streets, and multiple transit routes and vehicles (including emergency vehicles) can take advantage of dedicated BRT lanes. Disabled vehicles can be removed with little delay. For all of us who witnessed the T literally ground to a halt by severe weather this winter, what is also of note about BRT is its greater flexibility and resilience in the face of extreme New England weather or other shocks to the transit system. Boston’s “snowpocolypse” demonstrated that when the T’s capacity is weakened, our surface roads lock down with overflowing traffic they can’t handle. BRT can move more of those people, faster and more efficiently.</p>

<p>Perhaps most importantly, BRT is significantly faster and less expensive to implement, operate, maintain, and upgrade than rail projects. A common timeframe for BRT is three to four years, as seen in Los Angeles and Pittsburgh. By comparison, the 4.3-mile Green Line extension has been on the drawing board since 1990. It finally broke ground in 2012 and is not expected to be completed until 2020, at a cost of $1.4 billion. Cleveland’s HealthLine BRT, widely seen as the best in the United States, has done wonders for a corridor between two downtown hubs, with a price tag of $50 million for vehicles, stations, and platforms. For perspective, last year the T approved spending of $566 million for new Orange and Red Line cars.</p>

<p>For the past two years, as an extension of Barr’s commitments to help the region address climate change, we convened a group of stakeholders to study whether and how BRT could work here and what benefits it might bring. <a href=""http://www.bostonbrt.org/the-sponsors"">The Greater Boston Bus Rapid Transit Study Group</a> consisted of sixteen members with deep roots across Greater Boston and expertise in transportation, development, and climate. Together, along with the nonprofit <a href=""https://www.itdp.org"">Institute for Transportation &amp; Development Policy (ITDP)</a>, the group analyzed a number of potential corridors in which BRT could reduce congestion, better serve communities, provide more direct connections between neighborhoods, and bolster planned future development.</p>

<p>Earlier today, the Study Group released its findings in a report titled <em>Better Rapid Transit for Greater Boston: The Potential for Gold Standard Bus Rapid Transit Across the Metropolitan Area</em>. The report—available on <a href=""http://www.bostonbrt.org"">BostonBRT.org</a>—offers the first city-wide technical analysis of BRT in the nation and recommends five corridors that look particularly promising.</p>

<p>We certainly can’t continue to do the same old things. And we shouldn’t, especially when there is an opportunity to do so much more, better, and smarter. It is crucial that we take this moment, not just to patch problems in an outdated rail system, but to reimagine and modernize transit to meet the region’s needs. As Boston undertakes a city-wide visioning process on the future of transportation in the region—<a href=""http://goboston2030.org/en"">Go Boston 2030</a>—BRT should absolutely be part of the conversation.</p>

176,How to Keep Audience Next From Clicking Unsubscribe,<p>Dr. Manuel Pastor talks to Boston arts leaders about what it will take to stay relevant to an increasingly young and diverse audience.</p>,"<p>All of a sudden, it is vision season in Boston. From <a href=""http://imagine.boston.gov"">Imagine Boston 2030</a> to <a href=""http://goboston2030.org/en"">Go Boston 2030</a> to <a href=""http://bostoncreates.org"">Boston Creates</a>, Bostonians are coming together in citywide planning exercises to talk about what is most important to them, their hopes and dreams, and the future they want to create together. In this context, Barr recently invited <a href=""http://dornsife.usc.edu/pere/pastor"">Dr. Manuel Pastor</a>, professor of sociology and American studies and ethnicity, and director of the Program on Environmental and Regional Equity, at the University of Southern California, to share his research and perspectives on who will be living, working, and playing in Boston over the coming decades. Dr. Pastor spoke to both the transportation and arts communities on the implications of the city’s changing demographics. I was lucky enough to attend his presentation to the arts community at a packed Paramount Theatre.</p>

<p>Some of my main takeaways were:</p>

<p><strong>Arts leaders should think jigsaw puzzle not chess.</strong> In twenty years, Boston will look like a completely different city. Race demographics are shifting and the age gap is widening.  Unlike most of the country, Boston is still growing its immigrant population, due mostly to U.S.-born individuals.</p>

<p>These changes highlight the importance of increasing access to the arts for all—what Dr. Pastor referred to as “creative equity.” This means not only discounted or giveaway tickets to established, downtown venues, but more arts in more neighborhoods. Dr. Pastor introduced the metaphor of a jigsaw puzzle and a chess game to illustrate this key point of creative equity—implying that arts leaders (and the whole city through the Boston Creates process)—should cast itself as puzzler, not a chess master. In chess, the players are defined in strict categories (usually into black vs. white) and can move only in rigid, straight lines. The player wins chess by knocking out other pieces, some of which have a higher value than the others. In a jigsaw puzzle, the only way to complete the picture is to find a place for every piece.</p>

<p><strong>Mentorship will help us “bridge generations and geographies.”</strong> Dr. Pastor spoke about his own experiences as a young Latino man making strides in a field where no one looked like him. As one consequence of this, he admitted, “My generation doesn’t know how to mentor well,” and stressed the importance of young people actually helping the older generation learn how to do that, how to give them what they need. Mentoring, he added, will help us “bridge generations and geographies.” Art, especially art with a social justice component, can serve as this shared connection and enrich both sides of the age gap. </p>

<p>This point resonated with Aysha Upchurch, a choreographer who works with adolescents and children through the Harvard Graduate School of Education’s <a href=""http://www.pz.harvard.edu"">Project Zero</a>. She noted that “Pastor made it clear we must embrace arts as a social justice mechanism for our youth, and this will require arts leaders to pay attention to their own cultural competencies and the scope of their programming.”</p>

<p><strong>Art is a powerful vehicle to make connections and meaning.</strong> Dr. Pastor closed by quoting his son Joaquin, a musician and theater-maker, on the intrinsic value of being creative with one’s community. When describing why he wanted to be an artist, Joaquin responded simply, “I want to make beautiful things with my friends.” The arts are not strictly utilitarian, but have influence on how we see and experience our world and embrace a collective identity and sense of place.</p>

<p>“Dr. Pastor’s remarks about the role the arts can play in ‘transforming people’s hearts’ and ‘making sense of their lives’ was extremely compelling,” commented Shaumba-Yandje Dibinga, founding artistic director of <a href=""http://www.originationinc.org"">OrigiNation Cultural Arts Center</a> and a <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/fellows/alumni"">2009 Barr Fellow</a>. “The notion that the arts can transform artists and their audiences is one of our core values. His use of what he describes as ‘value-based data’…provided the exact framing and context that we need to craft a compelling case for our work.”</p>

<p>In the end, the main takeaway for me was that, as audiences change in regards to age, race, and geography, the ways for them to engage with and create art must change, too. Dr. Pastor reminded arts leaders to pitch for the coming America and embrace the opportunities for creative thinking that arise in a shifting, but increasingly connected, world. </p>

175,"For Second Time, Boston Named Nation’s Most Energy-Efficient City",<p>ACEEE Scorecard spotlights innovative ways cities are saving energy.</p>,"<p>Last week, the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) released its second biennial <a href=""http://aceee.org/press/2015/05/boston-nyc-washington-dc-san?utm_content=bufferf17dc&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer""><em>City Energy Efficiency Scorecard</em></a>, recognizing Boston and other cities for their leadership in advancing energy efficiency. Fifty-one large U.S. cities were compared across five policy and practice areas. This is the second time Boston placed first in the City Scorecard, achieving 82 points out of a possible 100, an improvement of more than five points from 2013. Joining Boston in the top five cities are New York City, Washington, D.C., San Francisco, and Seattle. The next tier of top scorers were Chicago, Minneapolis, Portland, Austin, and Denver. Congratulations to all for your leadership on energy policies! </p>

<p>The Scorecard is important because it fosters healthy competition among cities, spotlights effective strategies, and elevates the level of accountability for city leaders. These are all great ways to propel cities to go further with their energy-efficiency efforts. These cities can also inspire their own states, according to <a href=""http://blog.ucsusa.org/which-cities-are-most-energy-efficient-boston-nyc-and-dc-take-top-honors-744?_ga=1.75111890.1319798179.1428412656"">John Rogers</a>, a senior energy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists. While both Boston and Massachusetts are ranked number one, some of the top scoring cities are in states that don’t earn high marks in ACEEE’s State Scorecard (for example, Austin’s home state of Texas ranked 34th). As Rogers states: “That makes those cities really important islands of efficiency in seas of…well, inefficiency. We can hope that their examples will inspire their state governments to embrace the most cost-effective power option out there.”</p>

<p>For Boston, this news is terrific recognition of what has been, and continues to be, a city-wide team effort, with leadership and coordination from the Mayor’s Greenovate Boston initiative and the engagement of the business and institutional leaders on the <a href=""http://www.greenribboncommission.org"">Boston Green Ribbon Commission</a>.

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Making it easier for people to bike, walk, or take transit:</strong> ACEEE found that, while a number of cities are making great strides in transportation, they could all do more to take advantage of their efficiency potential. Portland, Oregon, was the top scorer, with notable efforts in urban design to reduce car dependency and increase transit options. It has an aggressive goal of achieving 70% of commutes through people biking, walking, carpooling, or taking public transit by 2030, and has begun making changes in its transportation master plan to achieve these goals. Washington, D.C. was close behind. It has invested significantly in public-transit facilities, hosts several car-share programs, and operates a successful bike-share program.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Leading by example in city operations and facilities:</strong> This criteria reviewed different aspects of how cities are making their own assets and operations more efficient. ACEEE found diversity in the top scorers, indicating the different paths city governments are taking to become more energy efficient. Denver, New York City, and Phoenix tied for the top overall score. New York City excelled in performance management strategies. Denver performed well in the energy-efficiency goals category for being on track to achieve its local government operations greenhouse gas emissions goal for 2020. Charlotte, San Antonio, and Seattle earned perfect scores in managing efficiency in their existing assets and encouraging changes in employee behavior. San Diego was the only city to earn a perfect score in incorporating efficiency criteria into its capital investments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Building policies that drive the right behaviors:</strong> Boston is the leading city for building policies, because of its advanced building energy codes, and requirements and incentives for efficient buildings. A notable policy is the <a href=""http://www.cityofboston.gov/eeos/reporting"">2013 Building Energy Reporting and Disclosure Ordinance</a>, which brings more transparency to energy and water use in commercial and large residential buildings. ACEEE found, however, that while cities may have stringent codes in place, many struggle to devote resources and attention to building code compliance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Partnering with utilities to align efficiency incentives:</strong> Boston scored the highest in the energy utilities category because of utilities’ robust investments in electricity and natural gas efficiency programs. Boston benefits from state policies that require funding of energy-efficiency programs implemented by the electric and gas utilities, but it goes further by aligning the incentives offered by the utilities with local policy goals. Through <a href=""http://www.renewboston.org"">Renew Boston</a>, the City has forged strong partnerships with the utilities to offer deep incentives to small businesses, renters, and middle-income homeowners—groups with historic low participation rates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Setting goals and engaging at the community level:</strong> New York and Boston were the top scorers on community-wide initiatives because they have systems to track progress toward efficiency-related goals for the whole community and an array of community-facing initiatives. Boston has <a href=""http://greenovateboston.org"">Greenovate</a>, which engages all Bostonians in sustainability efforts. Boston also has efficient distributed-energy systems, such as district energy and combined heat and power, and is planning for future ones. Barr supports a District Energy Fellow at the <a href=""http://www.bostonredevelopmentauthority.org/news-calendar/news-updates/2014/06/06/citywide-energy-study-rfp-issued-q-a-with-travis-s"">Boston Redevelopment Authority</a> who is helping to catalyze a new generation of district energy systems.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Cities are the consumers of about two-thirds of the world’s energy and are responsible for about 70% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. They are home to more than half of the world’s people. By 2030, that percentage will swell to 60%. That is why helping cities advance efficiency has been such a focus of ours at Barr. Efforts to advance energy efficiency have multiple benefits: they not only drive down greenhouse gas emissions, they also generate economic benefits in terms of financial savings and job creation, improve air quality, and create more livable communities.</p>

<p>The ACEEE report card shows encouraging progress for the top scoring cities in the U.S. However, we should not rest on our laurels, but instead learn from the successful practices of other cities around the world and strive for that perfect score. The recently formed <a href=""http://usdn.org/public/Carbon-Neutral-Cities.html"">Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance</a>—a collaboration of international cities committed to achieving deep emissions reductions—is a great example of how cities can work together to meet their respective goals more efficiently and effectively. Let’s continue to align our efforts in the shared challenge of mitigating climate change.</p>

174,A Few Words with Leah Hamilton ,<p>Get to know Barr’s new director of education</p>,"<h4>How did you find your way into a career in education?</h4>
<p><div class=""Media -aside -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img alt=""Leah Hamilton Staff Photo "" class=""Media-image"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/453/crop_preview.jpg?1642116785"" /> </div> </div></p>

<p>When I was in graduate school studying business and social work, I was really interested in economic development and thought I would ultimately get into that sector. But through my field training, I spent time with 9th graders who had been placed in a program because they were academically underachieving at their high school in the Bronx. Our aim was to help these students address their social and emotional challenges and strengthen their academic skills so they could reenter high school.  Yet, I couldn’t help noticing the unique strengths each of these students brought. And it really shifted my frame. I saw how their school was not meeting their needs—and how the real challenge, and opportunity, was not in “fixing” students, but in changing that school, and the whole system of which that school was a part, to better serve its students. That was the root of my interest in working with students and thinking about how their experiences and needs could inform the environments we design for them. </p>
<h4>Earlier in your career, you helped launch and lead the Office of Multiple Pathways to Graduation inside the New York City Department of Education. What was the big challenge you were focused on there?</h4>
<p>At the time that I joined the Department of Education, the city was very focused on strategies to improve the high school graduation rate and secondary school reform. As part of that, we were aggressively creating new small high schools to replace large comprehensive high schools that had been failing students for so long. Leaders in the city, the department, and the community were rightly asking, what about the students who were already in high school but not making progress or had already disengaged and dropped out? In order to develop a strategic response to the needs of what we came to call the overaged and under-credited high school population, we needed to know how many there were, who they were, and what they needed to be successful. We launched the Office of Multiple Pathways to Graduation first to develop the necessary fact base for this part of the secondary reform strategy and then to redesign the system of secondary schools with the goal of getting more students, even those who had fallen behind or dropped out, to graduate.</p>
<h4>How did this new office engage?</h4>
<p>We first got grounded in the facts. We looked at every single young person who was enrolled in high school at any point over a six-year period to better understand the population we weren’t serving well. We found that the population was very diverse and needed a completely different kind of high school experience than they were getting.</p>

<p>Then, we looked at the schools that were serving these students better and tried to understand and replicate their best practices, while we discontinued programs that were not serving students well. We also invested in innovation and invented new, small, personalized and academically rigorous schools to re-engage this youth population. We created a portfolio of different models, or school designs, for young people. That’s why we called the office the Office of Multiple Pathways to Graduation, reflecting that different and multiple models may be required to get all students to the same high standard of college and career readiness.</p>
<h4>What outcomes have endured?</h4>
<p>The data showed that when an overage and under-credited student stayed in a comprehensive high school, his or her chances of graduating was 19%. If that student was able to attend a high-quality option designed to meet his or her needs, that graduation rate rose to as high as 70%, which, at the time, beat the district’s overall high school graduation rate. The new schools have endured along with the strong community partnerships that were formed when launching them.</p>
<h4>While you were at the NYC Department of Education, you worked with many different foundations. What reflections do you have from that vantage point about how philanthropy can be a constructive partner?</h4>
<p>The most productive partnership I experienced had a few common and, in my view, critical features, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each party enters with <strong>a learning agenda that is aligned</strong>. So, there is a strong sense of learning together and serving as thought partners for one another.</li>
<li>There is <strong>deep respect on both sides</strong>. We respected the foundation’s support and they respected the people with on-the-ground knowledge.<br></li>
<li>The NYC Department of Education is a large system with many competing priorities—and my program was just one of them. Constructive funding partners helped <strong>hold us accountable</strong> to achievement goals we had set together. This helped me advocate for what we needed, and to keep up momentum.</li>
<li>Constructive partners also helped us pick our heads up from our work and see what else was happening around the country. We learned from what our peers in other cities were doing and truly valued our foundation partners <strong>connecting us to that broader work</strong>.<br></li>
</ul>
<h4>Following your time at the NYC Department of Education, you became a funder yourself as a senior member of the Carnegie Corporation of New York’s education team. What are some of the key lessons you carry with you from that time?</h4>
<p>There are so many lessons I carry with me from my time at Carnegie, but here are two:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The learning never stops</strong>. I found that it’s important to constantly engage with the field, not only those you are directly funding. Some of the most productive work at Carnegie happened when we partnered closely with community or regional foundations, like Barr, which have such deep working knowledge of the issues, enduring relationships, and long-term commitments. We learned a lot from them.<br></li>
<li><strong>Impact requires risk and rigor</strong>. Foundation dollars are extremely valuable. They are like no other resource, often offering grantees the flexibility to take risks and play the catalyst role. But they are also limited resources. So, there is a real responsibility for foundations to engage in rigorous due diligence. Grantmaking dollars are most effective when foundations embrace both risk and rigor—then really exciting things can happen. </li>
</ul>
<h4>What drew you to this opportunity at Barr?</h4>
<p>There’s a tremendous opportunity here. The chance to lead the Education team here at Barr is especially exciting because the organization is undergoing strategic planning. While Barr wants to build on its history, it is also open to new ways to catalyze big change—in the context of a city and state that are trying to accomplish something they never have before, which is to get all students to a high level of readiness for post-secondary education and career opportunities. In order to do this, we must reimagine our schools. This undertaking has great potential because of the rich talent and resources in this region. The work here is also important on a national level: places around the country trying to solve similar problems will take notice. </p>
<h4>Closing thoughts?</h4>
<p>Barr has such a great history of giving and I’m thrilled to be a part of it and have the opportunity to build on the work that’s been done. I look forward to getting to know my colleagues, both at Barr as well as at our many partner organizations.</p>

173,Boston’s Arts Moment,<p>A visit from NEA Chairman Jane Chu confirms the transformative potential—already being unleashed—of arts and culture in Boston.</p>,"<p>Two weeks ago, Boston had the opportunity to host National Endowment for the Arts Chairman Jane Chu for a visit to local arts organizations, to meet with local arts leaders, and to tour parts of our city where the arts have been a core part of community revitalization efforts. The chairman also met with Boston’s new chief of arts and culture, Julie Burros, and several other members of the Mayor’s cabinet, to learn about <a href=""http://www.bostoncreates.org"">Boston Creates</a>, the City’s recently-launched cultural planning process, and the more visible role arts is already playing across many facets of city government.</p>

<p>Chairman Chu agreed to include Boston as part of a New England tour at the invitation of Barr President Jim Canales, who joined her for the day. As a snapshot of the lively social media discussion sparked by the Chairman’s visit (and the <a href=""https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2015/05/01/city-development-boom-must-include-arts/EkEoo0XJFNKPq67cCdIn2H/story.html""><em>Globe</em> op-ed</a> she and Jim authored together), we compiled and shared this <a href=""https://storify.com/BarrFdn/barr-welcomes-nea-chairman-jane-chu-to-boston"">Storify</a> last week. With the benefit of a bit more time and distance from that bright and sunny first workday in May, we offer three final reflections:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>It starts with community</strong>. Our first stop of the day was the Upham’s Corner neighborhood in Dorchester and the Fairmount Cultural Corridor, which is a three-year-old effort to use arts and culture as a catalyst for community revitalization. From Boston Foundation President Paul Grogan, to Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative Arts &amp; Culture Manager Ramona Alexander, to others involved at different times and in different ways, we heard that the impetus and ongoing direction and leadership of this exciting and continuing project has always been from the community itself—with the City and area funders bringing critical support to foster and unleash that potential. Chairman Chu noted how much sustainability depends on just such a balance, with community members creating the vision, identifying their priorities, and setting the agenda for change.</li>
<li><strong>It’s the whole, not the parts</strong>. Later in the day, David Dower and David Howse of Emerson College led us on a walk down Washington Street in downtown, through the neighborhood once known as Boston’s “Combat Zone,” but which is now a vibrant center of arts activity and one of Boston’s fastest-growing residential communities. Key to this development was Emerson’s commitment, when the City agreed to sell it multiple abandoned theatres, to create spaces for the benefit of the broader community—to pledge itself to strengthening the whole sector, not itself only. This is evident in both ArtsEmerson’s programming, which has always aimed to complement, not compete, with existing Boston theater companies, and to draw in new audiences; as well as in partnerships with other presenting organizations, like the small nonprofit <a href=""http://www.baaff.org"">Boston Asian American Film Festival</a>, which, after years in makeshift venues, now presents in Emerson’s state-of-the-art screening room.</li>
<li><strong>What a moment for Boston</strong>. As we left Boston City Hall, Chairman Chu and several of her staff all emphasized how fortunate Boston is—and how unusual compared to other cities—to have a mayor and a cabinet full of leaders who so clearly recognize the power and potential of arts and culture. Indeed, Boston’s incredible moment of opportunity was a recurring theme throughout the day, as we took in the new Janet Echelman sculpture soaring above the Greenway and as we made our way from downtown to Artists for Humanity in South Boston to close out the day with a reception of NEA grantee organizations and other local arts leaders. Don’t take this for granted, they urged us. Don’t waste this rare moment of opportunity.</li>
</ul>

<p>It was encouraging to have such strong and clear confirmation from Chairman Chu of something so many have worked on for so long—now coming to fruition in exciting ways. It is a rare moment for arts and culture in Boston. And the time to engage in the collective work of shaping a world-class arts and culture city is now.</p>"
172,A Year in Context,<p>A look back at my first year at the Barr Foundation.</p>,"<p>This week marks a year since my arrival as Barr’s president. Since last May, I have sought to use <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/contributors/james-e-canales"">this space</a> to provide regular updates and will continue to do so. Yet, this one-year mark also offers an appropriate time to reflect upon the broader evolution of the Barr Foundation.</p>

<p>Among the many reasons I relocated from San Francisco to Boston was the opportunity to work for a foundation with a strong reputation, poised for its next stage of evolution. During the past year, I have met with our many partners across the nonprofit, philanthropic, public, and private sectors, and I have seen first-hand the progress and impact of activities that Barr has been privileged to support in its arts and culture, climate, education, and global programs.</p>

<p>This offers us a solid foundation upon which to shape the next stage of Barr’s contribution. We do so with a focus on building on our strengths and an orientation to embracing change as more of an evolution than a revolution. As a first step, we devoted this past year to getting clear—and, we hope, being clear—about our answers to fundamental questions about why we exist, what we believe, and how we work.</p>

<p>As I have shared in previous blog posts, we crafted a <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/from-the-president-january-2015"">new mission statement</a>, articulated a set of <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/from-the-president-fall-2014"">core values</a>, committed ourselves to our three domestic programs, and determined to approach our work through a more <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/from-the-president-december-2014"">regional perspective</a>. With these important decisions behind us, we are now engaged in strategic planning across each of our core program areas and will share the results of these efforts as they unfold, beginning later this year.</p>

<p>We have undertaken this work in the context of a foundation that has been steadily evolving toward more openness and broader external engagement. This year, we made several strides in this respect. We launched a <a href=""http://www.barrfoundation.org/"">new, more engaging website</a>, and we have established an active presence on social media (<a href=""http://www.twitter.com/barrfdn"">@BarrFdn</a> on Twitter). We have been using these tools to communicate about our work with greater frequency and depth. We have also pursued targeted opportunities to lend Barr’s voice and perspective to our fields of work and to the broader issues Barr focuses on. My <a href=""https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2015/05/01/city-development-boom-must-include-arts/EkEoo0XJFNKPq67cCdIn2H/story.html""><em>Boston Globe</em> op-ed</a> earlier this month with NEA Chairman Jane Chu is just one example.</p>

<p>These activities do not reflect an interest at Barr in seeking credit or attention for its own sake. Indeed, humility remains one of our core values and, in our view, is essential to effective philanthropy. At the same time, addressing climate change, expanding educational opportunity, and promoting cultural vibrancy are all important and urgent issues, and they demand that philanthropy apply its many resources to addressing them. To advance the issues we care about most, we are committed to deploying the full range of tools at our disposal. These include not only investing grantmaking dollars, but also lending our voice and perspective, sharing the knowledge and insight of our partners, and serving as a constructive partner to others who share our goals. We firmly believe that greater openness and transparency, and a willingness to deploy a range of tools as appropriate, amplifies our ability to have impact.</p>

<p>As I enter my second year and, together with my fellow trustees and staff, look toward the future, Barr’s evolution will continue. As it does, we remain committed to sharing our plans openly, and we will welcome the ongoing engagement and thoughtful counsel of many in this community who share our aspirations.</p>

<p>Thank you again for the warm welcome so many of you have provided to me in this first year at Barr. I look forward to our continued partnership in the years ahead, and, as always, I value <a href=""mailto:president@barrfoundation.org?subject=From%20the%20President%20-%20May%202015"">your thoughts</a>.</p>"
170,A New Model for Quality Improvement in Early Education,<p>Improving program quality to help more children enter school ready.</p>,"<p>Last year, Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh set an ambitious goal of providing high-quality early education to all of four-year-olds. He also appointed a task force (of which I am a member) to recommend strategies for getting there—recognizing that success will depend on consistently reaching a universal standard for high quality. </p>
<h3>Success will depend on consistently reaching a universal standard for high quality.</h3>
<p>In a <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/building-on-whats-working-in-early-education-in-boston"">previous blog post</a>, I highlighted the success of Boston Public School (BPS)’s pre-K program, which a Harvard study found to be one of the most effective public models in the country. <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/a-new-approach-to-scaling-high-quality-pre-kindergarten"">I’ve also highlighted</a> efforts by BPS and several community partners to extend the District’s model to community-based early education and care centers. Through this initiative, <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/partners/boston-k1ds"">BostonK1DS</a>, BPS has successfully expanded its evidence-based pre-K program to fourteen private, community-based classrooms—targeting neighborhoods with the highest concentrations of low-income students and English language learners.</p>

<p>But to help all children enter school ready, Boston must explore multiple avenues for delivering high quality early education. <a href=""http://thrivein5boston.org"">Thrive in 5</a> is piloting a model to improve program quality and child outcomes not only for preschoolers, but also for infants and toddlers. The <a href=""http://thrivein5boston.org/ready-educators"">Ready Educators Quality Improvement Pilot</a> was launched in 2013 in partnership with the <a href=""http://www.wcwonline.org"">Wellesley Centers for Women</a>. This multi-year initiative seeks to advance early education programs in Boston centers and home-based care sites to the highest level of quality, ensuring that all programs: 1) identify the needs of children; 2) provide appropriate resources and supports to meet those needs; and 3) demonstrate measurable improvement in child outcomes. The goal is for programs to build their capacity to use data for continuous quality improvement.</p>

<p>In its first year, the Ready Educators Quality Improvement Pilot worked with ten center-based early education programs, one large family childcare system, and four of its home-based providers. Each participating program was assessed to identify its strengths and areas for improvement. Based on these assessments, Wellesley Centers for Women helped the programs develop customized improvement plans, including targeted professional development, coaching, and consultation.</p>

<p>Thus far, the results look promising. The Wellesley Centers for Women recently completed an <a href=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/60/attachments/Evaluation_Y1_Revised_3.15.15.pdf?1431455599"">evaluation</a> of the programs’ progress within the first year. Six of eight participating centers with preschool classrooms showed significant improvements in classroom quality indicators. Additionally, all seven centers with an infant or toddler classroom showed significant improvements. The increases in the family childcare programs were not as dramatic, but all four programs showed some improvement as well.</p>

<p>Looking ahead to next year, Thrive in 5 and the Wellesley Centers for Women will help the participating programs continue to revise and implement their improvement plans so that they can maintain high standards and support improved child outcomes after the project ends. </p>

<p>This effort, along with the others I’ve highlighted, will help inform the field about how to scale quality programming. Our hope is that all Boston families will have access to high-quality, effective early education in any setting they choose, so children arrive at their first day of school ready—and excited!—to <em>continue</em> learning.</p>

169,Invisible Elephant in Climate Room Much Bigger Than We Thought,<p>New report finds extent of natural gas leaks three times greater threat to climate goals than previously expected.</p>,"<p>Boston and Massachusetts have earned top rankings for their energy efficiency programs. Both have a clear set of goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (25% by 2020 and 80% by 2050), a comprehensive <a href=""http://plan.greenovateboston.org"">action plan</a> to meet those goals, and have been reporting progress at or above interim targets. However, a recent study revealed a major missing piece in how they have been accounting for progress: natural gas leaks.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.bu.edu/energy/research/technologies-engineered-systems/methane-emissions"">study</a>, published in the <a href=""http://www.pnas.org"">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a> and completed by researchers at Harvard and Boston University, found that methane is leaking in the region as much as three times previously estimated. Infrastructure leaks account for 15 billion cubic feet of methane gas. </p>

<p>But what does this mean for the region’s climate goals? Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change; in fact, it’s 34 times more potent than carbon dioxide.  The leaking methane is enough to heat as many as 200,000 homes a year and, at today’s prices, represents $90 million in lost fuel.</p>

<p>This research is the first time methane leaks have been quantified using continuous measurements of methane in the air in a major metropolitan area. It builds on previous research on methane leaks from Boston and other cities, including <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/the-invisible-elephant-in-the-room-gas-leaks-and-climate"">Barr-supported efforts</a> to map the number of leaks in Boston and raise awareness of the problem. That study found 3,300 leaks in Boston and estimated that the state lost more through gas leaks than it saved through gas efficiency programs.  Concerned with the public safety, climate, and financial impacts of the leaks, Massachusetts legislators unanimously passed a law last year requiring utilities to classify and repair leaks in a timely fashion. The new law also allows municipalities to request data about the location of gas leaks. The legislature, however, chose not to address smaller leaks or the fact utilities are permitted to pass the costs of lost gas on to customers—so there is no financial incentive for utilities to manage leaks in their distribution networks. Two new bills have been filed this year to try fix these problems.</p>

<p>Barr grantees the <a href=""http://www.cleanwaterfund.org"">Clean Water Fund</a> and <a href=""http://www.mapc.org"">Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC)</a> are working to inform municipalities that they can request leak data. MAPC is also helping to share approaches on how municipalities can coordinate road reconstruction projects with utilities so that pipe repairs can be made when the roads are opened up.</p>

<p>In a <a href=""http://centerforenergyenvironmentalstudies.blogspot.com/2015/01/a-27-methane-leak-rate-represents-10-of.html"">follow-up calculation</a>, report co-author Nathan Phillips, a professor in the Earth and Environment Department at Boston University, found that, when Boston findings were extrapolated to the entire state, gas leaks amounted to about 10% of the Commonwealth’s annual greenhouse gas inventory for 2012–2013. That 10% doesn&#39;t even include carbon dioxide released from the remaining natural gas that is actually combusted, which adds another 10% to its emissions inventory. </p>

<p>To meet our climate goals, these are numbers that simply cannot be ignored. At Barr, we intend to continue following this issue closely, working with our many partners across the region to understand and incorporate these important findings into our future planning.</p>

168,Understanding Key Factors Impacting Black and Latino Male Achievement ,<p>New reports highlight challenges and opportunities for improving the academic achievement of Black and Latino young men in Boston Public Schools.</p>,"<p>Last week, the main meeting hall of Boston Public Schools’ (BPS) new headquarters was full to capacity for the release of a new report—the second of a two-part series that, together, comprise the most comprehensive analysis ever on enrollment, experiences, and outcomes of Black and Latino males in Boston. Prepared by the <a href=""http://www.ccebos.org/"">Center for Collaborative Education (CCE)</a> and the <a href=""http://annenberginstitute.org/"">Annenberg Institute for School Reform at Brown University (AISR)</a>, both reports were funded by BPS and Barr. </p>

<p>The first report, entitled <a href=""https://www.cce.org/uploads/files/Executive-Summary_final_pages.pdf"">“Opportunity and Equity: Enrollment and Outcomes of Black and Latino Males in Boston Public Schools,”</a> revealed that Black and Latino male students, who now account for 78% of all male students in BPS, face systemic barriers to opportunity and, as a result, are posting disproportionately low rates of academic proficiency and graduation compared to their peers. To help position BPS to address these barriers, the second report, <a href=""https://www.cce.org/uploads/files/PromisingPracticesUnfinishedBusiness_ES_FINAL.pdf"">“Promising Practices and Unfinished Business: Fostering Equity and Excellence for Black and Latino Males&quot;</a> focused on District schools in which Black and Latino males are performing comparably better, to identify effective practices.</p>

<p>Some of the common features of these more effective schools, which are explored in the report, are a caring school culture, abundant and high quality opportunities for faculty to collaborate, instruction that is differentiated or individualized to meet student needs, and active family engagement and leadership.</p>

<p>However, the report also found that such practices alone were insufficient to meet the educational needs of Black and Latino male students. Instead, the report advocates for abandoning the “color blind” approach evident in many schools, urging the District to ensure every school conducts professional development on culturally responsive curriculum, instruction, and assessment.</p>

<p>Since its inception, Barr has been committed to expanding educational opportunity so that all children can reach their full potential. A critical piece of that work is often this type of research, which helps us understand what the barriers are to that potential, and to set the table for new conversations, new thinking, and new action to remove them.</p>

166,Making Our Streets Work for Everyone,<p>Boston set to create its first “Complete Street”</p>,"<p>Whether we choose to drive, walk, bike, or ride transit, our streets should get us where we need to go as efficiently and safely as possible. Our streets should work for everyone. Yet, for decades, street design in this country has centered first and foremost on the car. People who make (or would like to make) other choices are an afterthought—not infrequently with disastrous consequences. With a different approach, called “Complete Streets,” we are starting to see more examples of places remaking their streets so they work for everyone, no matter how they choose to get around. </p>

<p>This Complete Streets approach was at the heart of new design plans <a href=""http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/03/24/victory-for-cyclists-commonwealth-avenue-install-protected-bike-lanes/Ew6SwQEhFxZB4XI3V5z80O/story.html"">recently approved</a> for a one of the busiest stretches of street in Boston—Commonwealth Avenue near Boston University. In its <a href=""http://bostoncompletestreets.org"">Boston Complete Streets</a> proposal, the City of Boston committed to completely reimagine a 7/10-mile stretch of Commonwealth Avenue, a victory for advocates who have pushed for years to make our city safer for all. Among the most passionate Complete Streets advocates is <a href=""http://www.livablestreets.info"">LivableStreets Alliance</a>, a Barr grantee. I recently spoke with Jackie Douglas, executive director of LivableStreets, to get her insights about what this win means and what lessons it may hold for others engaged in similar efforts.</p>
<h4>The City of Boston just announced plans for a major overhaul of a significant section of Commonwealth Avenue. Break it down for us—what are some of the biggest changes to come?</h4>
<p>Several of the new design elements have never been done before in Boston. The new design includes separate bike lanes that use parked cars as a barrier to protect people who bike from traffic (instead of the more common painted bike lanes where people on bikes act like a barrier to protect empty parked cars); raised islands and crosswalks make intersections safer for people who walk; enhanced bus stops and signal priority for the Green Line and buses make travel easier and more efficient for people who use transit. Considering that the original design had wider car lanes that would encourage speeding, narrower sidewalks, no transit enhancements, and no protected bicycle lanes, the new design is a major step forward for the city and the 100,000 people who use Comm Ave every day. </p>

<h4>Why this stretch of road? What are the challenges this plan aims to solve?</h4>
<p>This is a busy and extremely dangerous stretch of road in Boston with a high crash rate. We have been focused on Comm Ave for ten years and saw a major opportunity when a total of $17 million in local, state, and federal funding became available to reconstruct it. Through this project we knew we could directly address safety and livability issues. In addition, we could protect the needs of the area’s growing population of people who want to bike, walk and take transit. Bike use has increased as much as 135% since 2007, pedestrian volumes have increased 80% since 2001, and car volumes have decreased as much as 31% since 1987 in the project area, according to the Boston University Master Plan (sections 8.5.1-8.5.6).</p>
<h4>For people who live, work, go to school, or commute on the streets, how will their experience be different?</h4>
<p>For that one stretch it will be a comfortable oasis for everyone moving on the street. The design will make it safer and calmer to walk, bike, and drive. People biking will be protected, intersection design will provide more visibility and predictability, and the change in roadway should discourage speeding. The buses and Green Line will also get signal priority. At first, since it is so new, people may feel a little uneasy as they grow accustomed to it. This stretch of road is also only 7/10 of a mile. It won’t connect well right away. But we see it as an important proof of concept. From LivableStreets’ perspective, Comm Ave is only the first step to creating a visionary network of streets.</p>

<p><blockquote class=""Pullquote Pullquote--that""> <p>hope</p> </blockquote></p>
<h4>The LivableStreets Alliance has been working to improve Comm Ave for a long time. What were some of the keys to getting this win?</h4>
<p>A multi-faceted approach was key. We were diligent about keeping abreast with the project after the last public meeting in 2012. Also central to this win was building relationships with decision makers throughout City Hall and convening partner organizations that focus on single issues in order to propose a collective, well-grounded solution. What took us over the edge was mobilizing massive public support through our Street Ambassadors program. We collected thousands of stories from people who use the roadway and worked to make sure decision-makers were hearing those stories. Finally, we organized a community public meeting when there wasn’t otherwise going to be a public meeting and as a result received a lot of media attention.</p>
<h4>What didn’t work?</h4>
<p>All of the advocacy groups working on Comm Ave were not united at first. If all of the partners had just continued to go off and do their own thing (and at times this was close to happening), it wouldn’t have been as successful. The City started listening more intently when we pulled everyone together to have one voice for a Complete Street that works for everyone—rather than separate voices advocating narrowly for features (bike lanes vs. sidewalks vs. car lanes vs. parking) different stakeholders cared most about.</p>
<h4>What advice do you have for others looking to make their streets safer?</h4>
<p>Get involved with LivableStreets! The truth is, it’s still very cumbersome to know how to create change on one’s street—to be aware of the feasibility of different options, to know who to contact and when, and to find out what public agencies are already planning for your street. Additionally, public processes are often reactive (i.e., in response to proposed plans from outside the community, rather than generating ideas from the community), inaccessible (e.g., requiring citizens to speak up at a public hearing in the evening), or non-existent.</p>

<p>Knowing this, LivableStreets created an Advocacy Committee that serves as a platform where people can get support from experienced advocates, learn about what is going on throughout the region and get help on any specific project they are interested in influencing. Through this committee we are tracking 88 projects in the Boston region, including several besides Comm Ave in the city, and others in communities such as Arlington, Cambridge, and Somerville. So <a href=""http://www.livablestreets.info/projects"">get involved</a> to find out what is happening and make change in your own community.</p>
<h4>What’s next for Comm Ave between this announcement and when it becomes a reality?</h4>
<p>We have some very specific work to do to keep the Comm Ave project on track to become a reality. Other sections of Comm Ave are currently in redesign mode too, so we want to ensure that there is a seamless connection, as well as improvements like these in other parts of the city where there is capital to repave and reconstruct. From our perspective, the Comm Ave redesign is only successful if it’s part of a bigger vision for the future of our city.</p>
<h4>And for LivableStreets—what is your next big effort?</h4>
<p>For every block of the Comm Ave redesign, there are literally hundreds of blocks that are desperately in need of a more livable redesign. We are seeing progress, but we need to exponentially increase the scale and pace of that progress.</p>

<p>The City of Boston’s recent commitment to <a href=""http://www.visionzeroinitiative.com"">Vision Zero</a> gives us hope for more rapid progress. Vision Zero is a commitment to eliminate traffic fatalities and injuries. Most of our streets are dangerous by design, and LivableStreets hopes that the commitment to Vision Zero will shift priority from speed to safety with the philosophy that crashes can be avoided if streets are designed to protect all people. We will work to ensure that there is a strategic action plan with funding to support a comprehensive shift in the way we design streets.</p>

<p>In addition to tracking 88 specific projects in and around Boston, we are working to bring more visionary ideas to the city. Some of these ideas include implementing Gold Standard Bus Rapid Transit on our streets and connecting the existing greenway corridors along our rivers, harbors and parks.</p>"
165,Boston Launches First-Ever Cultural Planning Process,<p>A city takes the long-term view of arts and culture.</p>,"<p>On April 9, Mayor Martin J. Walsh announced the launch of Boston’s cultural planning process—<a href=""http://www.bostoncreates.org/"">Boston Creates</a>—a community-wide effort to develop a blueprint for arts and culture for the next decade. The Barr Foundation and Klarman Family Foundation have provided lead support for this vital effort.</p>

<p>This is an exciting time for arts and culture in Boston: we have a Mayor who both embraces and prioritizes the power of the arts and the potential of creative expression to inspire us, enrich our lives, and enliven our communities. The Mayor’s cabinet includes a new chief of arts and culture—Boston’s first in decades—and we are fortunate to have attracted Julie Burros from Chicago to this key leadership role. We also benefit from the presence of an engaged, diverse, and robust arts and culture community that will no doubt bring both great energy and creative ideas to this planning effort.</p>

<p>With the capacity to take the long-term view and invest in the future, philanthropy also has an important role to play in this partnership. The Barr Foundation and Klarman Family Foundation are each dedicating $700,000 to support all facets of the planning effort, including all of the pre-planning work that has already taken place. We have made these commitments above and beyond our typical grantmaking in the arts in order to ensure Boston fully seizes this once-in-generation opportunity.</p>

<p>As we have learned from others in preparation for Boston’s planning process, we have concluded that the cultural planning effort needs to be both thoughtful and comprehensive; it needs to engage a broad cross-section of every community in Boston; it needs to assemble the very best talent to facilitate the planning effort and to bring best practices from other parts of the country; and it needs to produce a plan that is both visionary and actionable.</p>

<p>We also realize that creating a cultural plan represents just a first step. Along with many others, we are committed to investing in helping the most urgent and exciting ideas that emerge from this planning process to move from concept to execution and to make the plan a reality.</p>

<p>Boston is a world-class city, as demonstrated by the strength of its educational institutions, its contributions to key advances in medicine, its growing technology sector, and its rich cultural offerings, among many other assets. As such, we deserve a world-class cultural plan that positions Boston as a leader in deploying its many arts and culture resources toward the creation and sustenance of vibrant, diverse, and engaged communities.</p>

<p>And so, our journey begins.</p>"
164,Readying for Rising Seas,<p>Boston is the fourth most vulnerable city in the U.S. to the impacts of sea-level rise. How can we prepare?</p>,"<p>Can you imagine how Boston will look 100 years from now—when the waters of Boston Harbor are predicted to rise as much as four to six feet?</p>

<p>Recently, architects, planners, and designers were challenged to help Boston answer that question. The <a href=""http://www.bostonlivingwithwater.org"">Boston Living with Water</a> competition solicited innovative ideas for three sites around the city. Design ideas ranged from “living levees” that could soak up water during storms, to elevated walkways, to entirely new landforms and systems of canals. Come June, one of the design teams will be awarded a $20,000 grand prize. </p>

<p>Creative solutions and competitions like these can help keep our long-term challenge in mind. Some cities begin to organize around climate-change resiliency only in the wake of natural disasters—like New York after Hurricane Sandy or New Orleans following Katrina.</p>

<p>Here in Boston we cannot afford to wait. If we want to protect the city’s assets along the waterfront (which some have valued at close to $500 billion), we must start now—ahead of the next storm and well before flooding becomes a monthly or even daily occurrence. Indeed, the level of the Boston Harbor is already nearly one foot higher than it was 100 years ago, thanks to climate change and the subsidence of filled land.</p>

<p>That is why several of us who sit on the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/partners/green-ribbon-commission"">Boston Green Ribbon Commission</a>, a collaboration among public- and private-sector entities on climate change, have been actively engaged in resiliency planning. Our analysis over the last year has led us to six priorities for Boston to enhance its resilience to rising seas:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Scenario planning:</strong> Agree on the range of scenarios that should be used for resiliency planning—using the best-available science. Ongoing monitoring to assess the changes underway every five to ten years is critical, too.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prioritization:</strong> Integrate all vulnerability assessments to develop a common set of priorities. There are many risk assessments now underway by state and city agencies (e.g., MassDOT, Massport, City of Cambridge, City of Boston Water and Sewer, FEMA). We must create a common database to identify top priorities for infrastructure investment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Solutions Toolkit:</strong> Develop a new arsenal of design solutions for what we call “resilience districts.” These feasible design solutions—on the neighborhood, watershed, harbor, or regional scale—will help various neighborhoods and the Boston waterfront as a whole become more resilient. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Design Standards:</strong> Determine design and regulatory standards that should be put in place to govern future infrastructure expenses and private sector development. We should integrate these standards with existing planning to ensure all new infrastructure investments consider and integrate sea-level rise risks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Governance:</strong> Determine a governing structure that can work effectively across various political jurisdictions. This new governance structure should provide a coordinated plan of action for defending the city and metro region over the long term. Mayor Walsh has already taken the first step by deciding to host an upcoming regional mayoral summit on this subject.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Financing:</strong> Develop financing mechanisms to address infrastructure needs and incentivize the private sector. Financing sources such as insurance premium reductions that reward best practices or green bonding to create capital for resilience projects will help property owners prepare and will reduce the burden on taxpayers if a major storm hits.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>While these six priorities are an important start, there is a long road ahead in addressing rising sea levels. However, I take hope from the Netherlands, a country that has been battling the sea for eight centuries. There, seven out of sixteen million people live successfully below the level of the sea, and some sixty to seventy percent of the nation’s GNP is produced below sea level. Rather than retreating or relocating (which may be appropriate in other, less urbanized coastal areas along the coast), the Dutch have found a way to combine a variety of structural and non-structural measures to protect their nation. If they can do it, so can we!</p>"
163,Proving it Pays to Walk ,"<p>A conversation between Barr’s Mary Skelton Roberts and Chris Leinberger, lead author of a new report on Walkable Urban Places (a.k.a. “WalkUPs”), a promising pathway to a more vibrant, equitable, and low-carbon region.</p>","<p>Neighborhoods that are vibrant, are connected, and offer residents a rich array of transportation, recreation, and housing choices improve people’s quality of life and reduce their carbon footprint.  As it turns out, they also generate significantly more tax revenues than communities that are not walkable.  Our region has the potential to be among the most livable, sustainable, and resilient in the U.S.—but only if we are smarter about where and how we build.  Investing in WalkUPs, or walkable urban places, is one pathway to that smarter growth. </p>

<p>A new report, <em><a href=""http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/2015/03/11/inside-the-walkup-wake-up-call-boston"">The WalkUP Wake-Up Call: Boston</a></em>, identifies all of the current and potential WalkUPs in Metro Boston and ranks them based on a combination of economic performance (real estate values and tax revenues) and social equity indicators (housing affordability, access to jobs and opportunity).  In addition to showing how current WalkUPs could improve, the report highlights emerging and potential WalkUPs that look the most promising.  With funding from the Barr Foundation, this research was conducted in collaboration with Northeastern University’s Dukakis Center for Urban and Regional Policy and the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, and in conjunction with LOCUS, a coalition of real estate developers and Cushman &amp; Wakefield, the largest commercial real estate broker in the region.</p>

<p>I recently caught up with Chris Leinberger, president of LOCUS and co-author of the report, to get his insight about what potential WalkUPs hold for Greater Boston. Below is an excerpt from our conversation. </p>
<h4>What makes WalkUPs worth a look?</h4>
<p>Infrastructure and real estate have big implications for our economy—together they represent 35% of our nation’s wealth. How we invest in these two areas has a fundamental impact not only on where we live and how we get around but on our economic vitality and environmental sustainability.</p>

<p>We are currently experiencing a huge structural shift in how we invest our resources. The shift, which began in the mid 1990s, is moving investment from drivable sub-urban to walkable urban areas. </p>
<h4>Out of the emerging WalkUPs identified in the report, which excites you most and why?</h4>
<p>Assembly Row is a new WalkUP that just opened on a former industrial site in Somerville. This site includes a new MTBA station as well as both retail and housing development. This is the first time metro Boston has seen this type of WalkUP—the redevelopment of a former industrial site or brownfield—and this will be the first of many to come.</p>
<h4>What is an example of a WalkUP done well in the U.S.?</h4>
<p>The county of Arlington, North Virginia, has eight WalkUPs—more per capita than any other county. It is the model for urbanization of the suburbs. These suburban WalkUPs enable people to enjoy an improved quality of life with greater access to shops, restaurants, and other amenities within walking distances from their homes.  </p>
<h4>What makes Arlington WalkUPs so successful?</h4>
<p>When Arlington invested in transit back in the 1970s, they did it right by putting it underground along their existing commercial corridor. They also put in proper zoning along the transit line, which allowed for mixed development of office, retail, and housing, plus a commitment to attainable, reasonably-priced housing. </p>

<p>The developers had a strong base of research that helped guide their plans and make them successful. Twenty-five years ago, Arlington’s WalkUPs generated 20% of the tax revenue and that percentage was falling as the strip malls were dying. Today, after tripling the square footage of the corridor, the WalkUPs generate 55% of the county’s tax revenues and that percentage is climbing. </p>
<h4>Why is attainable housing a critical component to developing WalkUPs?</h4>
<p>If WalkUPs are not available to all of us, then they can actually drive displacement and negative impacts of gentrification that depress both environmental and social equity indicators. </p>
<h4>What is the biggest barrier to developing WalkUPs?</h4>
<p>The biggest barrier to developing WalkUPs in metro Boston is “NIMBY,” or “not in my backyard” opposition. However, our research shows that those neighbors are actually the chief beneficiaries of WalkUP development—so through education they may come to see the benefits. </p>
<h4>What does it take to overcome this barrier?</h4>
<p>Get neighbors to participate. Actively engage the communities selected for development. Ensure that WalkUPs benefit current and future residents of those communities. The process really can become a win for all.  </p>
<h4>You know that Barr’s interest in WalkUPs extends from our commitments related to climate change and reducing carbon emissions. What is the potential WalkUP contribution there?</h4>
<p>This is the number-one way we in this country are going to address climate change—build more walkable urban places. One piece of evidence for this is that almost 75% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions come from buildings and transportation. When you move a household from a drivable sub-urban area to a walkable urban area, you decrease their household GHG emissions by 50% to 80%. </p>
<h4>How do you hope this research gets used and by whom?</h4>
<p>I hope this research gives a common language to people who are working on different pieces of this issue, but may not realize the potential for synergy. I hope it helps social-sector advocates understand how smart growth development and market forces can advance their goals. I hope it shows real estate developers the importance of community engagement and of building WalkUPs that include attainable housing. Finally, I hope it helps government officials make the case for WalkUPs. Our research shows WalkUPs generate twelve times the tax revenues compared to drivable sub-urban regional malls and business parks—new revenues that can be reinvested in communities in myriad ways.</p>

158,Welcome to Barr’s New Website,"<p>On behalf of all of us at Barr, I welcome you to our new website and introduce you to our new visual identity.</p>","<p>I invite you to explore the site and share your feedback with us. In <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/introducing-the-new-barrfoundation-org"">his welcome message</a>, Stefan Lanfer, Barr’s director of communications, describes in greater detail the new features and how they fit within our broader communications strategy. We hope you find this new Barr website to be as accessible, engaging, and useful as we aspire for it to be.</p>

<p>While such changes may appear cosmetic, we intend for them to signal the next era for Barr: one of greater transparency and open communication, deeper engagement with our many partners and stakeholders, and full intention to add our voice and perspective to advance our mission.</p>

<p>As part of our planning this past year, we have adopted a new <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/from-the-president-january-2015"">mission</a> and outlined a <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/from-the-president-fall-2014"">set of values</a>. In addition, we want our many partners to experience Barr as one foundation, which can be a challenge given the range of goals we pursue through different programs. To address this, we articulate below those elements that serve to unite how Barr carries out its philanthropic mission. Indeed, this new website is but one manifestation of Barr’s approach to philanthropy:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We foster a <strong>flexible and nimble culture</strong> that permits us to respond to the evolving circumstances in our environment, that encourages attentiveness to the needs of our partners, and that avoids rigidity and bureaucracy.</p></li>
<li><p>We deploy a <strong>broad range of tools</strong> and assets to advance our programmatic priorities, including convening, communications, and capacity-building.</p></li>
<li><p>We share <strong>knowledge and learning</strong> in ways that contribute to deeper understanding of our work, that document both successes and failures, and that promote continuous improvement.</p></li>
<li><p>We aim to be <strong>open and transparent</strong> about our work and to contribute to broader efforts that promote and advance the field of philanthropy.</p></li>
<li><p>We are <strong>active collaborators</strong> with partners from all sectors, recognizing that the challenges we confront require the active engagement of multiple actors.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As I said of our values when we introduced them last fall, these commitments are not simply words on a page to be adopted and filed away; rather, they are to be expressed daily in our work.</p>

<p>To that end, as we launch this new site, we view it as a work in progress that will be constantly evolving and, we hope, improving. The potential of this new platform will be fully realized only if we remain attentive to sharing new information on an ongoing basis, engaging all of you in our collective work, and positioning this as one of the many tools that advances Barr’s mission.</p>

156,Education Models Worth Expanding ,<p>New education report spotlights two Barr grantees as models worth expanding and replicating.</p>,"<p>Massachusetts has earned a reputation as a national leader in public education. However, achieving a system that prepares every young person for success requires a commitment to continuous improvement and honest reflection about what works. <a href=""http://www.renniecenter.org"">The Rennie Center for Education Research &amp; Policy</a> offers a valuable status check on the state of education in the Commonwealth. Its annual report, <a href=""http://www.renniecenter.org/condition-education"">“The Condition of Education (COE) in the Commonwealth: Priority Actions for a Statewide Education Agenda”</a>, includes data on achievement numbers, a policy action guide, and examples of programs that are achieving significant success.</p>

<p>According to Pendred Noyce, chair of the Rennie Center’s board, the report “highlights what works now” to help policymakers and educators harness the lessons learned from effective school practices. Among the efforts spotlighted in the report are two Barr grantees: <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/partners/boston-k1ds"">Boston K1DS</a> and <a href=""http://www.bc.edu/schools/lsoe/cityconnects"">City Connects</a>.</p>

<p>The Rennie Center recommends that policymakers consider the Boston K1DS project as a model for increasing high-quality pre-kindergarten across the state. Boston K1DS is a three-year demonstration project that is expanding Boston Public Schools’ pre-kindergarten model—one of the best in the nation—to fourteen center-based preschool classrooms. My colleague Kim Haskins discussed it in a post last summer, <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/a-new-approach-to-scaling-high-quality-pre-kindergarten"">“A New Approach to Scaling High Quality Pre-Kindergarten”</a>. The Rennie Center highlights Boston K1DS for addressing several key challenges to pre-k expansion:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Access:</strong> In Boston, affordable year-round pre-k programming is difficult to find. By incubating programs in community-based centers, the city can more quickly bring quality programming to scale than it could through its public schools alone.</li>
<li><strong>Quality:</strong> Boston K1DS requires professional training for its educators and provides ongoing professional development.</li>
<li><strong>Funding equity:</strong> The program offers financial support to increase educators’ salaries with the goal of improving the credentials, morale, and stability of educators in community settings.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the Rennie Center’s COE report recommends building upon the work of City Connects to develop a robust statewide approach to student support. The Rennie Center notes that “a child’s economic background remains strongly predictive of his or her likelihood of succeeding in school, earning a diploma, and engaging in the adult workforce.” Out-of-school factors (i.e., poverty, hunger, homelessness) account for two-thirds of the achievement gap between low-income students and their peers. City Connects, currently operating in sixty-five schools located in Boston and Springfield, as well as in New York and Ohio, connects each child with a tailored set of intervention, prevention, and enrichment services located primarily in the community. Students enrolled in City Connects are shown to significantly outperform their peers academically and, after they leave the intervention in grade 5, are fifty-percent less likely to drop out of school. In addition to highlighting its impact numbers, the Rennie Center’s COE report acknowledges several distinct features of the City Connects model:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A single point of contact:</strong> The school site coordinator—a full-time school counselor or social worker—is the backbone of the program. The coordinator works with teachers and others to assess each student, create individualized support plans, connect students to relevant services, and monitor effectiveness.</li>
<li><strong>Tailored supports for all:</strong> School teams review the strengths and needs of every student, grouping students into four tiers of escalating risk and identifying appropriate supports, ranging from prevention and enrichment. Plans are customized to the individual and adjust as students’ needs change, with services provided by school partners.<br></li>
<li><strong>Data-informed decisions:</strong> A secure database helps staff track referrals, service delivery, and student outcomes. School teams regularly review these data to check the degree to which interventions have been faithfully implemented, measure their effectiveness, and modify support plans as needed. </li>
<li><strong>Development of partnerships:</strong> The school is the nexus of service, with community partners providing many of the services. Those relationships are formalized through a Resource Advisory Council that represents agencies working at the school.</li>
</ul>

<p>By evaluating impact and building upon proven models of effective programming, the state can take a significant step towards ensuring each child has a strong foundation for success in the future.</p>

154,Profiles in Risk Taking: Stories From Three Arts and Culture Leaders,"<p>When economic times call for playing it safe, how can arts and cultural organizations remain as bold as their artists?</p>","<p>The Barr-Klarman Arts Capacity Building Initiative helps to develop a space in the Boston arts sector in which cross-disciplinary relationships can form, new ideas can be tested, and organizations can work together to push the limits. The initiative was launched in 2011 by the Barr Foundation and the Klarman Family Foundation in response to extensive conversations with grantees about what it might take for them to thrive and stay relevant to their evolving communities. Through the initiative, we committed to providing large, general operating support grants and technical assistance over 3-5 years. Grantees identified four key areas in which technical assistance and training were critical to their continued success:</p>

<ul>
<li>Achieving effective capitalization;<br></li>
<li>Diversifying audiences;<br></li>
<li>Defining and achieving mastery outcomes with youth; and<br></li>
<li>Growing cultural competency and proficiency. </li>
</ul>

<p>Our grantees also asked for real-life examples from their peers on capitalization and risk that they could share in their organizations and with their boards. In response, we commissioned <a href=""http://www.tdcorp.org/"">TDC</a> to produce <a href=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/52/attachments/Arts_Culture_Risk_Profiles.pdf?1423231309"">Profiles of Risk Taking</a>, stories about capitalization and risk as told by the leaders from three very different and prominent arts organizations: Opera Philadelphia (OP), Oregon Shakespeare Festival (OSF), and The Theater Offensive (TTO) in Boston. </p>

<p>Each leader conveyed a compelling and relatable story about encountering risk, speaking to the effects of their decisions and actions on their organizations’ capital structures. We find them courageous for sharing their stories — stories that are often kept private from the funding community —with the thirty-one Boston organizations participating in the initiative, and now in a wider forum. What follows is a link to these profiles along with introductions to the organizations and the challenges they were facing.</p>

<p><strong>A Conversation with David Devan General Director, Opera Philadelphia</strong></p>

<p>Caught in the thick of the 2008–9 financial crisis while attempting to institute a new strategic plan, Opera Philadelphia had a bold vision for the future but barely enough resources for regular operations. Forced to make cuts and institute a new level of financial rigor by forgoing the advance use of subscription funds, the organization made it through the financial crisis with a renewed artistic vision, a dynamic new product, and a commitment to capitalization and risk taking.</p>

<p><strong>An Interview with Bill Rauch Artistic Director, Oregon Shakespeare Festival</strong></p>

<p>Upon arrival, Bill Rauch propelled the Oregon Shakespeare Festival (OSF) to new heights of artistic innovation. With the development of the American Revolutions program and the production of classic musicals, OSF tried new works on traditional Shakespeare audiences, testing its own assumptions about audience tastes and preferences. Supported by a discretionary risk capital fund and its board, OSF weathered the 2008–9 financial crisis with a firm commitment to programmatic dynamism and artistic risk.</p>

<p><strong>An Interview with Abe Rybeck Executive Artistic Director, The Theater Offensive</strong> </p>

<p>The Theater Offensive The Theater Offensive (TTO) was founded on passion, creativity, and desperation. After years of creating great art in survivalist mode, the organization found itself with a broken balance sheet and its future operations under threat. Knowing that it needed to take big risks and make deep cuts, TTO implemented a strategic plan that laid out a new vision to reinvigorate programming and recapitalize the organization, while staying true to its roots as a community-based and community-driven organization.</p>

153,Boston Preparing for the Storms Ahead,"<p>More than sixty inches of snow falling in fewer than three weeks has most Bostonians saying uncle. However, these superstorms—or ""snowmaggedons""—are not expected to let up any time soon.</p>","<p>A <a href=""http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/science/2015/02/04/global-warming-won-prevent-massive-snowstorms-study-suggests/tJIpBkbD56rb7XjTBkZdrJ/story.html"">recent study</a> by an MIT professor found that while climate change could mean less overall snow in a given year, it could also mean extreme snow events, especially for places like Boston. Increased amounts of water vapor and changes in the circulation of the atmosphere can cause an intensification of the snowfall extremes.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Bostonians, the city is taking a long-term view with regards to climate. Boston’s Mayor Walsh recently released an update to the City’s <a href=""http://plan.greenovateboston.org"">Climate Action Plan</a>, which provides a roadmap for how Boston reduces its carbon footprint and prepares for climate change.</p>

<p>The climate plan update has some good news: Boston is on a track to meet its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction goal of twenty-five percent by 2020. Between 2005 and 2013, GHG emissions declined by seventeen percent (equivalent to taking 120,000 homes off the grid), while population and jobs increased by nearly eight percent. Before Bostonians rejoice over this accomplishment, it is important to note that most of this reduction came from the generation of cleaner energy—in particular, the replacement of coal and oil with gas to generate electricity and steam. Energy efficiency was another key contributor, yet, with most of the coal and oil now out of our energy supply, renewable energy and energy efficiency will have to play larger roles in driving down emissions.</p>

<p>Boston’s climate goals are ambitious, but achievable. The Climate Action Plan sets sector-specific GHG and program participation targets, giving Boston residents, businesses, institutions, and government a clear blueprint for success. Barr supported this planning effort and the Greenovate Boston Fellows, who were the lead organizers in helping Boston build a long-term vision for climate change mitigation.

I recently caught up with Greenovate Boston Fellow Leah Bamberger and with Vivien Li, co-chair of the Climate Action Plan Steering Committee, to learn more about the plan.</p>

<p><strong>Mariella:</strong> Leah, how did you engage the community to provide ideas for the plan?</p>

<p><strong>Leah:</strong> Our goal was to make it as easy as possible for everyone in the community to provide input to the plan and to share their ideas. This is critical for the success of this plan, because if Boston is going to reach its climate goals, we need every business and resident to play a role in implementation. By engaging the community from the beginning, we hope they will be supportive of implementing the plan as well. We offered multiple platforms—including a ‘virtual town hall’ at <a href=""http://engage.greenovateboston.org/"">Engage.GreenovateBoston.org</a>, the Greenovate Boston Community Summit, which had more than 500 people participate, and more than a dozen community-led meet-ups. In addition, the Steering Committee, along with its sub-committees, provided more formal feedback and guidance throughout the process. This diverse group of individuals offered their expertise in sustainability and provided perspective from all sectors of the community.</p>

<p><strong>Mariella:</strong> The plan is unique in the sense that it sets targets for sectors such as neighborhoods and large commercial, institutional buildings. Going forward, how will Bostonians know how we are doing in relation to those targets?</p>

<p><strong>Leah:</strong> These targets are important because they really drill down into the data, turning a somewhat abstract greenhouse gas reduction goal into something much more tangible, like the number of home weatherizations that we must complete by 2020 if we are to reach our goal. This is empowering information for us and the community to rally around. All of this progress will be tracked online with the new performance measurement system at <a href=""http://plan.greenovateboston.org"">Plan.GreenovateBoston.org</a>. This transparent system will help keep government, residents, businesses, and institutions accountable, because it is up to us all to implement this plan.</p>

<p><strong>Mariella:</strong> The plan also recommends that Boston start positioning itself to reach its long-term goal of eighty-percent reductions by 2050, as well as making the city more resilient to climate change. What are the next steps in getting us to a carbon neutral and resilient city?</p>

<p><strong>Vivien:</strong> This plan incorporates numerous strategies to move Boston to be carbon neutral by 2050. Over the next ten years, for example, Boston will explore the conversion of its municipal vehicle fleet to a zero-carbon fleet by 2030; expand public and private infrastructure to support electric vehicles; work closely with the MBTA on ways to transition its vehicles to net-zero carbon energy sources; and facilitate the expansion of district heating, cooling, microgrids, and renewable energy deployment throughout the city.</p>

<p>This spring, Mayor Walsh will convene the first-ever regional climate preparedness summit of mayors and other elected officials to begin to work together on making the region more climate resilient. For Boston’s contribution, we will continue to integrate climate preparedness into all project and permit reviews; address operational vulnerabilities identified in the 2013 assessment of municipal facilities; and work with community organizations to create neighborhood-based programs that protect our most vulnerable populations and low-income neighborhoods. We heard loud and clear during last year&#39;s Greenovate Boston Community Summit that residents want to be involved in preparing for the future, and this plan embraces an active and informed citizenry working together with City officials.</p>

152,Investing in Nonprofits’ Most Essential Assets: Leaders,"<p>Historically, less than one percent of foundation giving has gone to leadership development. A recent SSIR blog series offered a forum for foundation leaders, including Barr’s Jim Canales, to weigh in on smart ways to change that equation.</p>","<p>When I arrived at the Barr Foundation last year, one of my first priorities was to work with our founding trustees to articulate a set of values to guide the foundation now and for years to come. I introduced these in my <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/from-the-president-fall-2014"">Fall 2014 &quot;From the President&quot; message</a>. One of these core values is to “invest in leaders.” We seek to support effective visionary, and collaborative leaders, who motivate others, drive change, and produce results.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -aside -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img alt=""SSIR logo"" class=""Media-image"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/305/crop_preview.jpg?1642116416"" /> </div> </div></p>

<p>This conviction is why I eagerly contributed to a recent series in <em>Stanford Social Innovation Review</em> (SSIR). Called <a href=""http://www.ssireview.org/talent_matters"">&quot;Talent Matters,&quot;</a> the series aimed to advance a conversation about how the social sector can make talent a bigger priority. Among those sharing their perspectives were esteemed foundation colleagues <a href=""http://www.ssireview.org/talent_matters/entry/supporting_nonprofit_leadership_a_pre_flight_briefing"">Daniel Lee</a>, executive director at Levi Strauss Foundation; <a href=""http://www.ssireview.org/talent_matters/entry/helping_social_change_leaders_thrive"">Pamela Shifman</a>, executive director of the NoVo Foundation; <a href=""http://www.ssireview.org/talent_matters/entry/leadership_for_results"">Donna Stark</a>, vice president of talent and leadership development of the Annie E. Casey Foundation; and <a href=""http://www.ssireview.org/talent_matters/entry/investing_in_leadership_to_accelerate_philanthropic_impact"">Ira Hirschfield</a>, president and trustee of the Evelyn and Walter Haas, Jr. Fund.</p>

<p>As Ira highlighted in his piece that initiated the series, less than one percent of overall foundation giving went to leadership development between 1992 and 2011. Drawing on the examples of a number of funders who have prioritized this issue, in my article, I offered four guiding principles—four Es—for funders considering how to invest in nonprofit leadership:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Encourage Customization:</strong> At its core and at its best, executive coaching is a highly customized activity that considers a leader’s particular skills, context, and opportunities. With the guidance and support of a trained executive coach, leaders can realize their full potential.</li>
<li><strong>Entrust Leaders:</strong> The best philanthropy enables leaders to do their work without prescribing a path to the desired results. In this spirit, foundations should provide flexible resources that permit the leaders to identify how best to advance their goals.</li>
<li><strong>Expand Horizons:</strong> When given the opportunity to step back from the day-to-day demands, leaders are able to expose themselves to different ways of thinking. Sabbatical programs are one way that nonprofit leaders can return to their work refreshed, energized and full of new ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Engage Others:</strong> As most talented chief executives will tell you, their success is highly dependent upon other leaders across the organization, at the staff and board level. Given this, funders would do well to actively support leadership teams and seek to build more effective systems for organizational governance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Prioritizing the sustained development of nonprofit leaders could mean a higher return on foundation investments. I hope this conversation sparked by the SSIR series continues to be prominent in the social sector as we strategize for greater impact.</p>

151,From the President – January 2015,<p>Introducing the Barr Foundation’s new mission statement.</p>,"<p>Dear Friends,</p>

<p>As we start a new year, I am excited to share the Barr Foundation’s new mission statement:</p>

<p><em>To invest in human, natural, and cultural potential, serving as thoughtful stewards and catalysts.</em></p>

<p>Our new mission is the product of lengthy discussions among our trustees. It aims to unify Barr’s activities across our various programs, as well as to reflect our aspirations about Barr’s role in advancing that work. Here are some of the key ideas we sought to capture in these fourteen words:</p>

<ul>
<li>We invest in <strong>potential</strong>. We embrace the optimistic view that potential already exists, and we view Barr’s role as helping to preserve and enhance that potential when it is already manifest, and to remove barriers that inhibit its full expression when it isn’t.</li>
<li>We focus on the potential we see in our <strong>human</strong>, <strong>natural</strong>, and <strong>cultural</strong> assets and resources. This informs our core program areas of Education, Climate, and Arts &amp; Culture.</li>
<li>We view Barr’s role as both a <strong>steward</strong> <em>and</em> a <strong>catalyst</strong>. We seek to nurture and enhance vital community assets at the same time as we cultivate and advance those breakthrough ideas that will shape our collective future.</li>
<li>We exist to <strong>serve</strong>. Consistent with our values, we acknowledge the privilege inherent to philanthropy and bring a service orientation to our work.</li>
</ul>

<p>As we enter a year of focused planning within each of our core program areas, we do so with greater clarity about the key tenets that will inform decisions about Barr’s program priorities and strategies, building upon the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/from-the-president-fall-2014"">organizational values</a> we shared last fall, <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/from-the-president-december-2014"">the update I posted in December 2014</a>, and including this new mission.</p>

<p>Clearly, such statements only matter to the extent they are lived out by an organization and made manifest in its work. That is our commitment at Barr.</p>

<p>I will continue to update you on our program planning as the year unfolds. I am delighted to report that my next update will occur in the context of a refreshed and more user-friendly Barr Foundation website, which we will launch in the first quarter of 2015. The new site will offer a more vibrant and engaging way to communicate about our work and that of our partners. It will also serve as the center of an emerging digital strategy to ensure we not only communicate with, but also engage with, our partners and stakeholders.</p>

<p>As always <a href=""mailto:president@barrfoundation.org"">we welcome your suggestions</a> about ways we can communicate more effectively. And we welcome your thoughts on our new mission.</p>

<p>With continued appreciation for your interest in the Barr Foundation and partnership in our work,</p>

<p>Jim Canales</p>"
150,Join the Conversation about Boston’s Transportation Future,<p>What’s your question about getting around Boston in the future? Go Boston 2030 is a new campaign to shape the future of how people get around our city.</p>,"<p>Fifteen years ago, an elevated highway still cut through the heart of Boston’s downtown—the end of the “Big Dig” still seven years away. Fifteen years ago, Bicycling Magazine kept ranking Boston among the country’s worst biking cities. Now that elevated highway is gone. Boston’s downtown and waterfront are linked by the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway, which attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors a year. We’ve got a Bike Czar, 100-plus miles of bike lanes, and more than a thousand <a href=""http://www.thehubway.com"">Hubway</a> bikeshare bikes spreading their way into surrounding cities, with more than a million miles logged by residents, commuters, and tourists.</p>

<p>What a difference fifteen years makes. How much further could we go over the next fifteen years? How convenient, fast, and fun could it be getting around Greater Boston? In fifteen years—2030—Boston will turn 400 years old. This is our chance, in our historic city, to make transportation history.</p>

<p>What if we never had to wait for a bus again? What if our roads fed the grid? What if our transportation cleaned the air? These are among the questions the City of Boston will consider as it launches <a href=""http://goboston2030.org/en"">Go Boston 2030</a>—a new campaign to shape the future of how people get around our city. </p>

<p>The initiative, which Barr is supporting, aims to create a bold and strategic plan for Boston’s transportation future. That is why the Go Boston 2030 planning process relies heavily on the input and engagement of Boston residents. From now through February 8th, the City is soliciting questions from all over the city—from people old and young who live in, work in, and visit Boston.</p>

<p>The goal is to get as wide a range of ideas from the public as possible. Look for Go Boston 2030 signs and sample questions on your MBTA trains and buses, on billboards in Fenway, and at the Convention Center. And the Go Boston 2030 truck will be roving about the city gathering questions, too.</p>

<p>So, what’s your question about getting around Boston in the future? Visit Go Boston 2030 to see and react to questions others are asking, and to submit yours.</p>

149,Boston Hospitals Achieve Healthy Reductions in Energy Consumption,"<p>New data shows Boston hospitals have cut their energy use by six percent over the last three years, despite continued facility growth. These reductions have not only saved the hospitals $12 million—they have helped put Boston on track to achieving its ambition climate goals.</p>","<p>With more than 30 million square feet of real estate that consumes, on average, two and a half times as much energy as typical buildings, Boston’s health care sector has a massive carbon footprint. Indeed, without the active support of healthcare, there would be little hope for Boston to achieve its <a href=""http://greenovateboston.org/about"">ambitious climate goals</a>.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Boston’s health care sector is full of champions who are leading by example, making major investments to increase efficiency, working collaboratively to share what’s working, and encouraging their peers to follow their lead.</p>

<p>Results thus far are impressive. The health care sector typically sees a 1.5 percent annual increase in energy use (due to expansions in physical plants and energy-intensive medical technologies). However, from 2011 to 2013, the sector in metro Boston actually reduced its total energy use by six percent—thanks to significant investments in energy efficiency. This reduction is equal to eliminating the annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of nearly 7,500 passenger vehicles. What is also remarkable is that the hospitals in the region <a href=""http://www.greenribboncommission.org/downloads/Boston-GRC-Health-Care-Energy-Analytics-final.pdf"">joined forces to gather this data</a>, which is the first of its kind in the nation. Through these reductions, hospitals have avoided $12 million in energy costs—enough to pay for health care services for more than 1,000 Massachusetts Medicare enrollees.</p>

<p>Two important factors helped catalyze these new ways of working. One is the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/partners/green-ribbon-commission"">Green Ribbon Commission</a>, a group of more than thirty business and civic leaders who came together in 2010 to help Boston implement its Climate Action Plan (and which I profiled in an earlier post: <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/the-biggest-team-effort-in-boston-history"">“The Biggest Team Effort in Boston History”</a>). The other key factor has been a Green Ribbon Commission working group focused on health care, co-chaired by Gary Gottlieb, president and CEO of Partners Health Care, and by Kate Walsh, president of the Boston Medical Center. With the help of the nonprofit Health Care Without Harm, which Barr supported to facilitate this working group, Gottlieb and Walsh have engaged the CEOs of more than twenty hospitals and their facility directors to share strategies for increasing efficiency in energy and transportation. The group has also fostered collaboration among energy utilities and state policymakers to develop approaches and programs that enable health care facilities to make the deepest improvements possible.</p>

<p>The Barr Fellows Program honors the contributions of some of the most gifted and experienced leaders in the Boston area. Over a three-year period that includes a sabbatical, international travel, a series of retreats, and peer learning, these distinguished leaders have an important opportunity to reflect on the accomplishments of their organizations and find the inspiration to attain even higher levels of effectiveness, creativity, and innovation.</p>

<p>The Barr Fellows program was launched in 2005. This new group of 12 Fellows will join a network of 36 alumni from prior years who have toiled effectively to build a better Boston for all—as champions of the poor, the homeless, the environment, public school kids, the region’s artistic soul, and more.</p>

<p>The Barr Fellowship was featured in an October 2010 <em>Boston Globe</em> article, “Forging community ties: Fellowships foster exchange among nonprofit leaders.” which is available free for subscribers or for purchase <a href=""http://archive.boston.com/business/articles/2010/10/22/fellowships_foster_exchange_among_nonprofit_leaders/"">here</a>.</p>"
144,The Climate Gap: Inequalities in How Climate Change Hurts Americans & How to Close the Gap,<p>The Climate Gap focuses its sites on California to determine how vulnerable citizens across the United States will cope as the environment responds to climate change.</p>,"<p>On the international level it is widely recognized that poorer less developed countries - who are least responsible for causing climate change - are also the most vulnerable to its effects. The Climate Gap explores how similar disparities manifest in the United States – often across racial and socio-economic lines. The report&#39;s authors propose a set of criteria for climate policies that close rather than exacerbate current inequities. They argue that polices designed with our most vulnerable populations in mind will actually yield the greatest benefits for all.</p>

142,Nonprofit/Nonprofit Collaboration in Boston,"<p>A Barr-sponsored report offers answers to questions about the potential, and the challenges, of nonprofit collaborations.</p>","<p>Can Boston’s nonprofits realize greater outcomes by working together in new structures or alignments, and, if so, what is preventing that from happening? What can foundations and support organizations do to overcome barriers, incent, catalyze, seed, provide tools and resources, or otherwise nurture the development of these new ways to work?</p>

<p>In 2006, Barr engaged Roy Ahn S.D., an independent consultant and senior research fellow at the Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations at Harvard University, to conduct a study on nonprofit collaboration in Boston. He found that such collaborations can be highly effective—resulting in cost savings, policy wins, and innovative thinking to address persistent problems.</p>

<p>However, based on interviews with nonprofit staff members and consultants to nonprofits, he also found that collaboration requires skills that often are not in the standard toolbox of nonprofit leaders or staff. And he identifies a number of concrete steps foundations can take to help diagnose and close those skill gaps.</p>

140,Barr Foundation Racial Justice Analysis,"<p>In 2007, Barr engaged the Applied Research Center and the Philanthropic Initiative for Racial Equity to assess our work to address inequities, especially those related to race.</p>","<p>In its first decade, the Barr Foundation expressed its mission as being focused on building a better Boston for all. In the fall of 2007, we began an inquiry into whether we were doing all we could to address inequities, especially those related to race. We invited a team from the Applied Research Center and the Philanthropic Initiative for Racial Equity to take a close look at our work and to help us understand 1) to what degree we generated outcomes that were racially just; and 2) opportunities to improve. Many of our grantees contributed to this research through interviews, surveys, and focus groups. For the Foundation, this report provided a revealing new frame for how to think about the patterns of inequity affecting our mission and made us aware of how much more intentional we need to be.</p>

<p>In recent years many of Barr’s colleagues in Boston have joined us in pushing for greater diversity in the composition of their staff, leadership, and boards. However this report challenged us to recognize that diversity, while a necessary first step, is only that—a first step. If we truly aim “to build a better Boston for all,” we must work to influence and change the institutions and structures that perpetuate racial injustice.</p>

<p>For more detail on the report’s findings, both the executive summary and the research team’s final presentation to us are available below. The Applied Research Center and the Philanthropic Initiative for Racial Equity also published a report called <em><a href=""http://racialequity.org/catalytic-change.html"">Catalytic Change</a></em>, which discusses the findings from their assessment at Barr alongside those from their work with the Consumer Health Foundation in Washington, D.C.</p>

135,Unequal Exposure to Ecological Hazards,"<p>A new study by Northeastern University shows that environmental racism and injustice are still urgent problems. Of the 30 most environmentally overburdened communities in Massachusetts, 24 are communities of color. The top 30 list includes all of Boston's neighborhoods except one.</p>","<p>Hurricane Katrina cast national attention on the environmental hardships inflicted upon poorer neighborhoods and people of color by the disaster in New Orleans and the Gulf Coast region. However a new report demonstrates that profound environmental injustices also exist in the Bay State. Environmentally hazardous waste sites and polluting industrial facilities are disproportionately located in communities of color and lower-income communities according to &quot;Unequal Exposure to Ecological Hazards 2005: Environmental Injustices in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts&quot; a new report by Daniel R. Faber associate professor of Sociology Northeastern University and Eric J. Krieg associate professor of Sociology Johnson State College. </p>

<p>&quot;An analysis of 362 communities throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts reveals that these populations live each day with substantially greater risk of exposure to environmental health hazards&quot; said Project Director Daniel Faber. &quot;And these disparities have worsened in recent years. A person living in a community of color is now thirty-nine times more likely to live in one of the thirty most environmentally-burdened communities in the state.&quot; </p>

<p>Faber notes that the report is the first to provide a method for ranking the environmental burden of communities in the state utilizing the 2000 Census as well as the first to measure cumulative exposure to environmental hazards of all kinds in Massachusetts. </p>

<p>Key findings </p>

<ul>
<li>Communities of color where people of color make up 25 percent or more of the total population average 48 hazardous waste sites per square mile. In comparison white communities (less than 5 percent minority population) average 2.1 waste sites per square mile. As a result communities with high minority populations average twenty-three times more hazardous waste sites per square mile than low minority communities.<br></li>
<li>Communities where people of color make up 25 percent or more of the total population average about ten times more releases of chemical pollution from industrial facilities per square mile than white communities (less than 5 percent minority).<br></li>
<li>Communities of color make up 9.4% of all towns in the state but receive 37.6% of all industry releases of carcinogens 32.8% of persistent bio-accumulative toxins and 37.2% of all reproductive toxins.<br></li>
<li>Low-income communities face a cumulative exposure rate to environmentally hazardous facilities and sites that is up to four times greater than higher income communities in the state.<br></li>
<li>Communities with high minority populations face a cumulative exposure rate to environmentally hazardous facilities and sites that is over twenty times greater than low minority communities.<br></li>
<li>The authors have compiled a list of the 30 towns most intensively burdened with environmentally hazardous industrial facilities and sites. Communities of color make up 24 (or 80%) of the towns on this list. If the numbers were egalitarian then only three communities of color should appear on this list.<br></li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;Clearly not all Massachusetts residents enjoy equal access to a clean environment. Communities most heavily burdened with environmentally hazardous industrial facilities and sites are overwhelmingly minority and lower-income. Governmental action is urgently required to address these disparities&quot; says Dr. Daniel Faber.

134,Immigrant Engagement in Public Open Space,<p>The first immigrants to arrive in Massachusetts brought with them a clear mental image of what public open space should look like and how it should be used.</p>,"<p>This was a shared image that reflected their deep connection with the open pastoral landscapes they left behind in England. In 1634 only four years after they formed Boston&#39;s charter the colonists set aside a parcel of land in the midst of their homes that would embody this ideal. They chose to tax themselves to pay for and maintain this land which became known as The Boston Common. Many came to see the site as &quot;sacred&quot; and an essential part of the community landscape. For this reason people have defended this civic space for nearly four centuries. </p>

<p>The colonists&#39; legacy of land stewardship lives on in Boston and in a host of conservation organizations across the country. Along with this legacy of passionate commitment to environmental stewardship however modern Boston has inherited a deeply held and often exclusive notion of what public open space should look like and how it should be used. In Boston the pastoral ideal was reinvented over time culminating in the creation of the city&#39;s landmark Emerald Necklace Parks at the end of the nineteenth century. Yet even for the largely European populace at that time Frederick Law Olmsted&#39;s bucolic vision for Boston&#39;s &quot;green space&quot; appealed deeply to only a portion of the city&#39;s people. </p>

<p>More than a century later this tension remains and has been further complicated by continued immigration not only from the &quot;old countries&quot; of Europe but also from New World countries in Latin America and the Caribbean as well as from Asia and Africa. The lack of engagement of more recent immigrants in &quot;friends of the park&quot; organizations and other environmental groups of today has led to concerns that while Olmsted&#39;s vision continues to resonate with a great many Bostonians it may not resonate with the majority of those who will decide Boston&#39;s future. </p>

<p>Today almost 30% of Boston residents were born outside the United States and of these nearly half came from Latin America a quarter from Asia and almost 10% from Africa. The future of the city&#39;s open space system - how much land is set aside and how that land is designed maintained and used - will increasingly depend on the passion and commitment of families and communities who may not see themselves or their interests reflected in the city&#39;s public lands. In this paper we consider some of the ways in which recent immigrants to Boston connect (and do not connect) to public parks and open spaces. </p>

<p>Our goal is two-fold: to explore alternative ways of &quot;seeing&quot; and using parks and open spaces in different communities in the city as well as to highlight specific strategies both here and across the country that successfully engage urban residents born outside the United States. If Boston&#39;s civic spaces are to be celebrated in the future as they have been in the past they must come to reflect the new diversity of Boston&#39;s people. Our hope is that these stories and models will encourage more culturally resonant uses of parks and other public open spaces and equip policy makers and environmental organizations to partner more fully with newcomer communities - in Boston and beyond. </p>

133,Lawrence Community Works,"<p>The problem that Lawrence, Massachusetts faces is familiar: how to restore a dying industrial city. But the answer is far from what community and economic developers are accustomed to trying. In quite unconventional ways, it builds heavily upon the social connections of individuals throughout the city to develop new leadership, vision, and change.</p>","<p>Lawrence a former textile center is one of the poorest urban centers in America with unemployment rates approaching twice the regional state and national averages. Home to successive waves of immigrants Lawrence&#39;s current population of 75,000 is majority Latino. </p>

<p>Five years ago William Traynor an experienced community development practitioner and Lawrence native arrived there to try to revive a failing CDC. With a cadre of MIT urban planning graduates and a handful of seasoned organizers he hoped to engage community residents in efforts to address the city&#39;s daunting deficits. </p>

<p>This much was clear to them: Lawrence lacked the civic leadership and the community assets such as public infrastructure and effective schools which make for healthy cities. The goal of the reborn CDC Lawrence Community Works should be to create a new leadership capacity out of the grassroots that would rally around implement and sustain a vision for the city&#39;s future. To achieve this LCW would have to get thousands of residents to talk about and work on local issues come together to build their leadership skills and connect locally in ways that would shape and advance a shared vision. </p>

132,Boston Green and Healthy Building Network,<p>The Boston Green & Healthy Building Network provides a platform for collaboration to promote green and healthy buildings for representatives from about ten Boston-area non-profit organizations and the City of Boston. This case study summarizes learnings and maps the evolution of the network's composition and dynamics since it was launched in 2005 at the initiative of the Barr Foundation.</p>,"<p>From April 2005 to present (early 2008) the Boston Green &amp; Healthy Building Network has provided a forum for collaboration to promote green and healthy buildings for representatives from about ten Boston-area non-profit organizations and the City of Boston. The Network was launched in 2005 at the initiative of the Barr Foundation where a senior program officer both identified the similar objectives of numerous non-profit grantees and City agencies working on this topic and recognized that their work was not coordinated. Barr sponsored a facilitator/coordinator to help the Network self-organize and determine its most useful objectives and practical actions.Since the Network&#39;s start-up it has contributed materially to advancing green and healthy building construction and maintenance policies practices and programs in the City. </p>

<p>In a survey done in mid-2007 95% of Network participants also indicated that the Network had helped their organizations advance their missions. The survey also showed that the key accomplishments of the Network fall into four areas: </p>

<ul>
<li>Enhanced connectivity among the Network participants leading to new relationships expanded knowledge and greater awareness of each other&#39;s work<br></li>
<li>Greater alignment and coordination of advocacy work by these non-profit organizations and enhanced access to decision-makers<br></li>
<li>Integration of green and healthy building objectives in tangible projects by the City of Boston and within the work of participating non-profit organizations<br></li>
<li>New collaborations among Network organizations leading to significant gains in promoting green and healthy buildings.<br></li>
</ul>

<p>Some key challenges the Network has faced include how to ensure that: </p>

<ul>
<li>Participants get sufficient benefit and value out of the time they dedicate to participating in the Network; </li>
<li>Network members find the most fruitful ways to collaborate; and </li>
<li>There is clarity about the Network&#39;s purpose and goals as it evolves.<br></li>
</ul>

<p>Lessons of this experience that could be applied more broadly include these findings: </p>

<ul>
<li>The group saw as critical the Foundation&#39;s funding for a facilitator to coordinate the Network and its meetings while remaining mainly &quot;hands-off&quot; in directing how the Network developed. </li>
<li>The Network&#39;s early focus on learning what each group did including developing a matrix to map who was doing what types of work helped people to see new opportunities for joint action increased coordination and reduced duplication of effort. </li>
<li>Lastly the Network&#39;s focus has been flexible and has evolved in response to the larger context (e.g. the City of Boston&#39;s green/healthy building agenda) and individual members&#39; needs.<br></li>

127,Understanding Cultural Competency in Experiential Environmental Education Programs,"<p>This report contains results from the assessments, recommendations for the environmental education field and a section on cultural competency metrics.</p>","<p>The Barr Foundation has made significant investments in experiential environmental education (E3) programs for youth. The foundation&#39;s theory of change is that urban youth who are engaged in experiential learning opportunities from a young age will acquire knowledge deep appreciation for the environment and the skills and self-efficacy to transform themselves into environmental stewards. This transformation from student to steward happens most quickly and most often when E3 programs are designed with a culturally competent foundation and succeed at reaching engaging and drawing on these youth&#39;s own cultural diversity. </p>

<p>In the spring of 2005 three Boston environmental education programs who were participating in a Barr Foundation-sponsored Experiential Environmental Learning Cluster decided to deepen their understanding of cultural competency. Antioch New England Institute&#39;s Community-based School Environmental project (CO-SEED) Urban Ecology Institute (UEI) and Mass Audubon&#39;s Boston Nature Center (BNC) participated in the Cultural Competency Assessment Project. Through this project consultants Judy Tso and Curdina Hill conducted individual cultural competency assessments at each organization. These assessments were aimed at capturing a snapshot of each organization&#39;s current progress in cultural competency and creating sets of metrics to measure future progress around objectives of cultural competency. The report contains results from the assessments recommendations for the environmental education field and a section on cultural competency metrics.</p>

124,Green Guide for Health Care™,"<p>A best practices guide for healthy and sustainable building design, construction, and operations for the healthcare industry developed by Health Care Without Harm.</p>","<p>The Green Guide for Health Care™ is the healthcare sector&#39;s first quantifiable sustainable design toolkit integrating enhanced environmental and health principles and practices into the planning design construction operations and maintenance of their facilities. This Guide provides the healthcare sector with a voluntary self-certifying metric toolkit of best practices that designers owners and operators can use to guide and evaluate their progress towards high performance healing environments. </p>

<p>Healthcare facilities present both a challenge and opportunity in the development and implementation of sustainable design construction and operations practices. Issues such as 24/7 operations energy and water use intensity chemical use infection control requirements and formidable regulatory requirements can pose significant obstacles to the implementation of currently accepted sustainability protocols. Furthermore it is appropriate that guidelines customized for the healthcare sector reflect the fundamental organizational mission to protect and enhance individual and community health and acknowledge the intrinsic relationship between the built environment and ecological health. As the healthcare sector develops a design language for high performance healing environments it has the opportunity to highlight the associated health-based benefits. This in turn can inspire the broader adoption of health based design principles in other building sectors. </p>

<p>This document is neither intended to establish regulatory requirements nor to be viewed as a minimum standard for design construction or operations. Rather it is designed to serve as a voluntary educational guide for early adopters of sustainable design construction and operations practices to encourage continuous improvement in the healthcare sector and to provide market signals to catalyze a richer palette of options for those who follow the early adopters. As the general level of green building practice rises it is anticipated that the Guide will be updated to encourage continued leadership and higher levels of rigor associated with creating high performance healing environments. </p>

119,Generating Change,"<p>Like many cities, Boston has a Climate Action Plan. Yet, the City has more than a plan for reducing its carbon footprint. It also has the engagement of multiple sectors of the community and their shared commitment to make big changes. A new report commissioned by the Barr Foundation details how.</p>","<p>Boston has a long track record of leadership on sustainability and energy efficiency – with City officials often leading by example. As early as 2005 Boston published and implemented a &quot;Integrated Energy Management Plan&quot; for the City&#39;s 362 municipal buildings. The plan identified $4 Million of savings from making City buildings more efficient and reducing their energy consumption. </p>

<p>A year later Boston made headlines as the first city in the nation to require all new large-scale developments be LEED certified. Also in 2005 Mayor Thomas M. Menino joined mayors from across the nation as one of the first signers of the <a href=""http://www.usmayors.org/climateprotection/agreement.htm"">U.S. Conference of Mayors Climate Protection Agreement</a>. With this act Menino committed Boston to meeting or exceeding the Kyoto Protocol targets for emissions reductions. This means reducing Boston emissions 20% below 1990 levels by 2020 and 50% by 2050. To achieve this goal the Mayor and his team knew they would have to expand the effort beyond municipal buildings and operations alone. They would need sustained support and action by multiple sectors of the Boston community. </p>

<p>In March 2009 the Mayor appointed a Climate Action Task Force to carry out this work. The Task Force had 22 members including business and nonprofit leaders policy advocates technical experts and residents. Their charge was to review the City&#39;s Climate Action Plan and make recommendations for how the entire city could engage in the work of climate action – and share in the benefits (such as energy savings and new &quot;Clean Tech&quot; jobs). After a year-long process that ultimately engaged hundreds of residents (including over 140 youth) the Task Force Presented their recommendations to the Mayor in the form of the report: <a href=""https://www.cityofboston.gov/Images_Documents/BCA_full_rprt_r5_tcm3-19558.pdf"">Sparking Boston&#39;s Climate Revolution</a>. The report included a portfolio of mitigation strategies that could result in $2 billion of savings to Boston businesses government and residents. </p>

<p>The story of how these stakeholders came together and reached consensus is itself a critical element on Boston&#39;s path to success in climate action planning. In 2009 as the process was still ongoing Barr commissioned a team of evaluators to document the strengths and challenges of the process. Their report Generating Change: How Boston Transitioned from Municipal to Community Wide Climate Planning  documents this process offers a blueprint for other communities seeking to move their climate efforts to new levels.</p>

115,Three Barr Fellows Named Among State’s Top Innovators,"<p>The Boston Globe names Lyndia Downie, Bill Walczak, and Margarita Muñiz to prestigious list.</p>","<p>This weekend, three Barr Fellows were named to a list of Massachusetts’ top innovators in a <em>Boston Globe</em> feature of those “representing the best the state has to offer in creativity industry and innovation.” All three are members of the Class of 2007.</p>

<p><strong>Lyndia Downie</strong> <a href=""http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2011/05/22/lyndia_downie_works_to_help_bostons_homeless"">tops the list of nonprofit innovators</a> for her work at Pine Street Inn. In particular she is credited for recognizing that the shelter’s most needy residents—the chronically homeless—were using the most resources but not getting sufficient help to leave Pine Street. By reducing the number of emergency beds and putting more resources into permanent housing, Downie and her team have contributed to a reduction of Boston’s homeless population by 30%.</p>

<p>Runner-up in the nonprofit category is <strong>Bill Walczak</strong>. Now president of Carney Hospital, Walczak is recognized for his three decades as co-founder and executive director of Codman Square Health Center, which the <em>Globe</em> describes as proof positive that “quality medicine can be delivered sustainably in one of Boston’s most deprived communities.” The Health Center regularly serves 20,000 patients a year in a beautiful facility, now planning a $14-million new wing.</p>

<p>Finally, in the education category the <em>Globe</em> named <strong>Margarita Muñiz</strong>, who has served nearly three decades as the principal of the “premier dual-language school in Massachusetts” Boston’s Rafael Hernandez School. The <em>Globe</em> points out that the school has grown so popular that more than 200 students are on its waitlist.</p>"
110,Helping by Not Helping,"<p>An interview between Barr’s Deputy Director Melinda Marble and Jesús Gerena of Family Independence Initiative, with Stefan Lanfer, knowledge officer.</p>","<p>If spending more and more on “solutions that don&#39;t make things better—and arguably even make them worse—is a variation of insanity,” then a new approach to fighting poverty that actually helps families lift themselves into middle-class security could aptly be called a stroke of genius.</p>

<p>Despite decades and uncountable dollars and hours spent on programs for the poor, there are far too few examples of families breaking out of what can be a generational rut. But that storyline is changing—thanks to a new approach first piloted in Oakland and San Francisco and, since 2010, taking root in Boston. This past June,  Barr’s Deputy Director Melinda Marble and Stefan Lanfer, knowledge officer, spoke with Jesús Gerena, who is leading the local effort to find out more.</p>

<p>In 2000, California Governor Jerry Brown was mayor of the City of Oakland. And he was fed up. Despite millions spent on programs to help poor families, the problem wasn&#39;t going away. Families were still poor and still dependent on public assistance. At the same time, in the corner office of a much-celebrated nonprofit across town, Maurice Lim Miller was puzzling over the same issue. After working in community development for 20 years he was starting to see the children of the kids he’d worked with years earlier seeking the same kind of help as their parents. So when Brown called on Lim Miller and challenged him to come up with a new approach, he was ready.</p>

<p>To begin, Lim Miller set aside the conventional wisdom of his field and years of experience. Instead he looked to the example of his mother who had led his family out of poverty. He also studied other working families and immigrant communities that had found the elusive pathways to middle-class security. The common thread? They all relied on themselves and each other, not handouts. With this insight, Maurice launched the <a href=""http://www.fiinet.org"">Family Independence Initiative</a> (FII) in 2001. Organized into cohorts of five or six families, participants worked together to set and reach financial academic and other goals. In exchange for monthly reporting on their approaches, their progress, their successes, and their challenges, they received small stipends from FII. After two years, members of that original cohort saw household incomes jump by 23% and savings by 240%. Fifteen families became first-time home owners. Twenty-eight expanded existing businesses or launched on new business ventures.</p>

<p>In the years that followed, FII expanded in Oakland, San Francisco, and then to Oahu, Hawaii. In the fall of 2009, FII came to Boston—with support from Barr and other local funders attracted by its potential for the city. Jesús Gerena, formerly of <a href=""http://hydesquare.org"">Hyde Square Task Force</a>, was tapped to lead the effort. In June 2010, FII Boston launched with 35 families. Within six months those families saw an average increase in household income of 13% and a 29% increase in savings—and they were making progress on a host of other self-defined goals.</p>

<p><strong>MELINDA: What drew you to the Family Independence Initiative?</strong>  </p>

<p>JESUS: I was hooked the first time I heard Maurice Lim Miller talk about FII. He began with his story focusing on his mom and the ways she pushed to lift their family out of poverty. His story is so much like my own. I&#39;m the youngest of three kids. When I was 10 my mum moved us from Puerto Rico to Amherst Massachusetts. She had 80 dollars in her pocket and a dream of doing better. Her sister had moved here a year before. They connected and really supported each other.   </p>

<p><strong>MELINDA: What was that like coming to Amherst from Puerto Rico?</strong> </p>

<p>JESUS: Cold. Although at the beginning I remember thinking &quot;This is like air conditioning. NICE and cold!&quot; 20 years later the winters have beaten me up a bit. </p>

<p><strong>MELINDA: Say more about the connections your mom and aunt made when you arrived.</strong> </p>

<p>JESUS: As soon as we landed people started coming to our house. One of them taught at a school of education. He made a contact for my aunt to be able to get her Masters. Someone else helped my mum pursue her BA. Someone else connected us to a dance troupe someone else to a church. At the start there were eight of us in a two-bedroom apartment. But soon we found someone willing to cosign for us to get our own place. Little by little all these connections added up to resources and to our family finding the avenues we needed to thrive. </p>

<p><strong>MELINDA: In a way FII is an effort to replicate the same kind of natural network that many families – particularly newcomer families – find when they come to this country. Is that right?</strong> </p>

<p>JESUS: That&#39;s it exactly. </p>

<p><strong>MELINDA: Talk about how this work has been taking shape in Boston.</strong> </p>

<p>JESUS: Sure. When I first started my main goal was to find those natural communities that are already connected and supporting each other – and to identify the real connectors and leaders along with the folks who are ready to take off but just need a launching pad. Most folks like my mum actually just need a little push. </p>

<p><strong>MELINDA: In general FII families don&#39;t qualify for public assistance even if they&#39;re just above the line right?</strong> </p>

<p>JESUS: Yes. For most of our families either they make too much or even if they&#39;re below the line they may choose not to take any assistance because of the stigma they attach to it </p>

<p><strong>MELINDA: That is always what attracted me to FII – it isn&#39;t one more program that won&#39;t do anything for families until they fall into crisis. Instead you help them build initiative and strengthen networks that push the risk of crisis further away. So you start by finding these connectors. What next?</strong> </p>

<p>JESUS: I leave it to them to organize a group of their colleagues friends neighbors or extended family. There could be deep relationships already but there don&#39;t have to be. The key is some level of trust and a willingness to deepen that trust because we ask them to make a two-year commitment to their group and to us and to meet monthly and share data. </p>

<p><strong>MELINDA: Data about what?</strong> </p>

<p>JESUS: Data about things like education housing assets and liabilities income... and also about how they are drawing from and giving to their networks. Everything is totally confidential. They go to a password-protected place on our website login and then self report. We give them all laptops so there is no technological barrier. And they&#39;re responsible to report back by the 7th of each month. Then every three months we sit down with them and audit. We say great you went to the doctors this many times to take care of your sons? Show me proof. Your kids&#39; grades improved? Show me proof. You helped someone by giving them a couch to sleep on? Give me their name and number so we can check. So we trust but verify. And for all of that we give them a stipend of up to $600 every three months. </p>

<p><strong>MELINDA: Where the exact amount depends on the specific goals they&#39;ve been working on and whether they&#39;ve achieved them?</strong> </p>

<p>JESUS: That&#39;s right. We allocate up to $30 per question that they answer per individual in a household. And this is really a major differentiator between FII and traditional service programs. We look at the whole household. </p>

<p><strong>MELINDA: So a cohort of six families might be 30 or 35 people that are being reached?</strong> </p>

<p>JESUS: Yes. We have six cohorts now. That&#39;s 35 families representing 152 adults and children. </p>

<p><strong>MELINDA: What happens at your monthly meetings?</strong>    </p>

<p>JESUS: We run the first meeting. We introduce FII give out computers and show them the website. Then we say &quot;OK now you know how it all works. The next meeting is up to you.&quot;   </p>

<p><strong>MELINDA: No helping?</strong> </p>

<p>JESUS: No helping. Our staff is trained from the beginning just to listen to capture stories and to trust that the families can figure this out on their own. If the staff becomes too helpful they can&#39;t work with us. We have to trust that families know better than anybody else how to achieve their goals. This was true in Maurice&#39;s family. It was true in my family. And it&#39;s true with the FII families. They just need opportunities. They need to see their efforts matched with results. </p>

<p><strong>MELINDA: When I visited one of your meetings and met some of the families I was really struck by how close they&#39;ve gotten and how they seem to rely on each other.</strong> </p>

<p>JESUS: It is amazing. Some of the groups have just taken off. One of my favorite stories is from our Puerto Rican/Dominican cohort that started in June 2010. One of the women was considering going back to school. She mentioned this at an early meeting. By the time we got to August members of her group asked &quot;OK. Did you enroll?&quot; When she said &quot;No&quot; and made excuses the group jumped on her. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; they asked. &quot;It&#39;s already August. September is right around the corner!&quot; They pushed her in the meeting. Then they called her afterwards. In fact we learned that several in her cohort made a pact with each other to harass her until she followed through. By the October meeting not only had she enrolled but she had turned in a first paper and just gotten her grade – an A. She started crying. &quot;If it wasn&#39;t for this support&quot; she said &quot;I never would have enrolled – all because I was afraid I wasn&#39;t going to make it. Now I&#39;ve proven to myself I can.&quot; Little by little she&#39;s on her way now. </p>

<p><strong>MELINDA: What is the data on results so far?</strong> </p>

<p>JESUS: In the first six months we saw a 13% increase in income for all of the families and a 29% increase in savings along with hundreds upon hundreds of activities to meet other goals. Let me give you another of my favorite examples – Candace whom I think you met. </p>

<p><strong>MELINDA: I definitely remember her.</strong> </p>

<p>JESUS: This year she got her driver&#39;s license. She got a job. She enrolled in school. Her husband is also taking classes for a nursing degree. They started saving to buy a home. There&#39;s more I&#39;m forgetting but you get a sense for all these little and not so little activities that accumulate to a lot. Now Candace and her husband are on track to buy a home. And this is not just wishful thinking. Candace is very self aware about their circumstances. A few months ago they lost a member of the family. And the costs associated with that put them back on their heels. It is just like you were saying Melinda – these families may be technically above the poverty line but they are just one emergency away from being in the poor house. So Candace will tell you &quot;As long as we don&#39;t have another emergency we&#39;ll be okay and we&#39;ll probably be able to buy a house.&quot; She knows there is still a ways to go. But for the first time her efforts are getting traction. And no matter what they have this community supporting them. Even as Candace and her husband build their financial safety net this community is their safety net too. </p>

<p><strong>MELINDA: I used to work in homelessness. The people who show up at shelters – more often than not it is families without money and without a safety net. So I hear the importance of that. But what do you say to skeptics to people who look at FII and ask &quot;Wouldn&#39;t these families make it anyway? Aren&#39;t they already enterprising?&quot;</strong> </p>

<p>JESUS: Clearly there is some self selection. We may talk to 35 individuals but only five join. And in many cases they are already leaders. They are the ones finding opportunities for themselves and for others and finding FII is one example. So yes I would say some of the participants would do great things on their own. But more often than not if you ask the families they will point to new connections they&#39;ve made and to the power of having this cohort behind them saying – and showing – &quot;I&#39;m invested in your success.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>MELINDA: And also making a habit of talking about goals.</strong> </p>

<p>JESUS: Definitely. From the very beginning we have them all write down their goals and figure out how to get to them. That is really important. </p>

<p><strong>MELINDA: I&#39;ve always thought that responsibility and initiative are like muscles you have to exercise or else they atrophy and you become dependent. So many social services actually end up promoting dependency – and you can feel it in their atmosphere. The middle class people in the room are all in the service-provider role and the low income people are in the role of supplicant. But at FII the tone of the interactions and the way the families carry themselves is all so different. You can really feel it.</strong> </p>

<p>JESUS: I&#39;m glad you mentioned that. Honestly setting that atmosphere is probably the hardest thing we do. For me the key has always been to make sure the families are driving the whole experience. The environment we have is to their credit because it is they who are pushing us. </p>

<p><strong>MELINDA: They&#39;re decorating right? Didn&#39;t they put up curtains in the office?</strong> </p>

<p>JESUS: They did. Yes. I&#39;ll give you an example that actually features Candace again...you should probably be interviewing her instead of me. At FII we send out a lot of emails – different opportunities I hear about from you from other funders from the families from other colleagues. I forward them all. </p>

<p><strong>MELINDA: Opportunities like a home buying program?</strong> </p>

<p>JESUS: That&#39;s right; or maybe a job or an afterschool program. The families are getting at least a dozen or more a week. So Candace said to me &quot;You need to start calling us every time there&#39;s a good opportunity. There are people who don&#39;t check email. And you have to make sure they don&#39;t miss anything.&quot; So I asked her right back &quot;What happens if there are a hundred opportunities a week? There are over 150 people right? So here are my choices: I can invest in hiring a full-time person or you can figure it out.&quot;  It was a little tense. But it was also a good conversation. She got it. </p>

<p><strong>MELINDA: Over time in California where FII started some cohorts moved beyond personal goals to start working on community goals. Do you see that happening in Boston?</strong> </p>

<p>JESUS: I do. In East Boston three of our families are running activities on Sundays for close to 150 families – none of whom are associated with FII. The same core group has also started a savings group where adults and children are putting money away for different goals. </p>

<p><strong>STEFAN: I&#39;ve heard you describe the hope that the FII families would have the chance to influence some of the policies that impact families like them. Say more about that.</strong> </p>

<p>JESUS: There are many examples. Childcare is a huge one. The way childcare subsidies are set up now parents have to choose to either go to school or to work. They can&#39;t do both. So they end up taking two or three times as long to achieve their educational goals. </p>

<p><strong>MELINDA: When I was working with women who&#39;d been in the shelter system we learned there is often a disincentive to take a pay raise because you could lose some or all of your childcare subsidy. There are a lot of other perverse incentives like that – to the point that for every new dollar they earn they can lose 50 cents in benefits.</strong> </p>

<p>JESUS: That&#39;s right. We are penalizing them as they move out of poverty rather than incentivizing their asset building the way we do for the rich.  Philanthropy is another area. A lot of the funding is divided into discrete buckets – one for children at risk one for parent organizing etc. In contrast we address the whole household because everybody in a household is affected by whatever happens inside that household. I hope we can help bring a shift in foundation funding to take that broader view.  Another area we&#39;d like to influence is the incentives and financing for small businesses. There is a huge entrepreneurial spirit in East Boston. And yet many businesses are being run behind closed doors because the costs are high to get properly established. For some of these small businesses I would be surprised if it took more than $15000 or $20000. But few banks are making those kinds of loans available. This is a missed opportunity all around. </p>

<p><strong>MELINDA: So is the idea that you&#39;ll follow these families and be able show all these different ways that they have exercised choice and control to improve their situation?</strong> </p>

<p>JESUS: That&#39;s it exactly. </p>

<p><strong>MELINDA: And then what happens? What&#39;s the long term plan for FII?</strong> </p>

<p>JESUS: FII Boston will add 115 families by year end. Referrals are coming in from all over. In the next two years we&#39;ll add 200 more families. Meanwhile Maurice and FII are getting a lot of attention nationally. This is creating an opportunity for us to really grow in numbers and to prove our theory of change beyond the shadow of a doubt. As we do that we expect to start hitting at some key national policies and to make real dents in the view that low-income families are somehow not equipped or that they don&#39;t deserve or can&#39;t achieve the same things as the rest of us. And we&#39;d like to bring closer the day when we stop treating them like we know better. </p>

<p><strong>STEFAN: When we talk about finding pathways out of poverty many think about not only the condition of poverty but also of getting out of impoverished places to higher opportunity places like Amherst where your mother took you and your family. Is that the path for FII families?</strong> </p>

<p>JESUS: What we care about most is that our families are in control and that they&#39;re making whatever choices are best for them. It could be that for some families that means leaving because they want to be able to buy a house and they can&#39;t afford one here. Or they may feel that the education choice is better somewhere else or the job opportunities. The bottom line is that we really don&#39;t care what they choose. What we do care about is that they make the decisions on their own and that those decisions benefit them.  That pretty much sums up this whole exercise. At the very first meeting we say to them &quot;Tell us what&#39;s right for you not for anybody else just for you.&quot; It is confidence building for them – to be reminded &quot;Oh yeah! I know. Deep down I already know. Nobody needs to tell me what I should be working towards.&quot; From there they start creating the change for themselves. </p>

<p><strong>MELINDA: One of the other strengths of the FII model is that it does not accept the typical meager definition of poverty. It reminds me of what Brent R. Moulton calls the &quot;Happiness Index.&quot; If you feel you are in control of your resources – even if your resources are few – then you may not feel impoverished where somebody making much more money might feel more impoverished more out of control.</strong> </p>

<p>JESUS: For us that is the key. If you feel in control of your life and that you can make choices for yourself and your family – that is happiness. With the stipends we can provide as much as $4500 a year for their efforts. On top of that almost all of our families have been able to increase savings and income in one way or another. But when you ask them what they see as the most valuable part of FII none of them mention that. They talk about the connections they&#39;ve made with each other. </p>

<p><strong>MELINDA: Well we are certainly very glad to have made a connection with you and to support this important work. Thank you for talking to me today.</strong> </p>

<p>JESUS: My pleasure.</p>"
106,Massachusetts Unseats California as National Leader on Energy Efficiency,"<p>For the first time in the life of its energy efficiency scorecard, the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) named a state other than California in the number one spot. In a first guest post, Jeremy McDiarmid, Massachusetts Director of Barr-grantee Environment Northeast talks about what it took and what it means that Massachusetts is now the national leader on energy efficiency.</p>","<p><em>Yesterday Massachusetts was recognized as the top state in the country for its energy efficiency policies and programs. This distinction came from the Washington D.C. based <a href=""http://www.aceee.org/"">American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy</a> (ACEEE) in its annual State Efficiency Scorecard. We asked Jeremy McDiarmid Massachusetts Director of Barr-grantee <a href=""http://www.env-ne.org/"">Environment Northeast</a> (ENE) to put this into context for us. The Barr Foundation is proud to have supported organizations that have been central to policy development and also to the ambitious and ongoing work of implementation that led to this great affirmation – including ENE <a href=""http://clud6.prometheuslabor.com/green-justice-campaign"">Green Justice Coalition</a>, <a href=""http://renewboston.org/"">Renew Boston</a>, and many others.</em>  </p>

<p>This is the fifth year of <a href=""http://www.aceee.org/sector/state-policy/scorecard"">ACEEE&#39;s Scorecard</a> and the first time that a state other than California has earned the top spot. This ranking affirms the energy choices Massachusetts has made: prioritizing cost-effective energy efficiency as the lowest-cost cleanest energy resource emphasizing the importance of a strong diverse stakeholder council to coordinate and spearhead the effort and committed program administrators. The <a href=""http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=gov3pressrelease&L=1&L0=Home&sid=Agov3&b=pressrelease&f=080702_bill_energy_clean&csid=Agov3"">2008 Green Communities Act</a> signaled a new approach‰ÛÓone that makes energy efficiency a priority resource set ambitious goals for achieving all efficiency that is cost-effective and puts Massachusetts on track to create $6 billion in economic benefits for consumers in the Commonwealth. Governor Deval Patrick traveled to the National Press Club in Washington D.C. to represent Massachusetts in this major achievement.  </p>

<p>Achieving the top spot has been the work of many people in the Patrick Administration state electric and gas utilities which administer programs and many stakeholders. While this ranking is a sign of great progress it in no way means that the work is done in the Commonwealth—opportunities for continued and expanded efficiency investment remain high and challenges exist but we are optimistic about building on these successes to date.  </p>

105,A Big Leap for Quality in Early Education,"<p>An interview between Stefan Lanfer, Barr's Knowledge Officer and Amy O'Leary, Director of the Early Education for All Campaign and mav Pardee, Program Manager of the Children's Investment Fund.</p>","<p>The achievement gap is evident even by the time kids start Kindergarten. All the research shows that high quality early education programs can narrow that gap. Yet, until recently, Massachusetts lacked a consistent way for parents, providers, and policy makers to assess or improve quality. Thanks to a new statewide effort launched earlier this year, that is all on its way towards big, systemic change.</p>

<p>Earlier this year Dr. Sherri Killins Commissioner of the Massachusetts&#39; <a href=""http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=eduagencylanding&L=4&L0=Home&L1=Government&L2=Departments+and+Boards&L3=Department+of+Early+Education+%26+Care&sid=Eoedu"">Department of Early Education and Care</a> (EEC) launched the State&#39;s Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS). In the midst of a challenging economy and widespread budget cuts Governor Patrick stood squarely behind the new effort. To better understand why this was such a priority and what QRIS may actually mean for young children and their families Stefan Lanfer, Barr&#39;s Knowledge Officer, spoke with two Barr grantees who have trained their efforts on closing achievement and opportunity gaps for the State&#39;s youngest citizens – Amy O&#39;Leary Director of the <a href=""http://www.strategiesforchildren.org/EEA.html"">Early Education for All Campaign</a> and Mav Pardee Program Manager of the <a href=""http://www.cccif.org/index.html"">Children&#39;s Investment Fund</a>.   </p>

<p><strong>STEFAN: In plain English what exactly is QRIS?</strong> </p>

<p>AMY: All the research shows that quality makes a big difference in terms of outcomes for kids. QRIS is a way to define what quality actually means. It creates a way for programs to assess their current quality and to have a clear pathway to improve. It lets EEC know how best to target resources. Ultimately it makes it easy for parents to know what quality looks like and how different programs stack up. It&#39;s like a five star rating for a restaurant or hotel. </p>

<p>MAV: That&#39;s exactly right. I&#39;d just add that QRIS is a big leap forward but by no means the first time quality has been a priority. EEC and those of us in the field have been working on it for a long time. That&#39;s why Massachusetts already has more nationally accredited sites than anywhere in the country. </p>

<p><strong>STEFAN: I&#39;m glad you brought up accreditation. To improve access to high quality early education in Boston Barr spent a lot of years helping programs achieve and maintain accreditation. After all the time and money is QRIS now introducing a whole new set of requirements and a brand new starting line?</strong> </p>

<p>MAV: That&#39;s a good question. It&#39;s one that came up a lot during the two years that our QRIS was being developed. Keep in mind the organizations providing early education and care programs in Massachusetts are largely pretty lean. They don&#39;t have big middle management layers. Usually it&#39;s one person. It takes over a year for a program to earn accreditation. Then every couple years they need to get reaccredited. That&#39;s why from the start it was so critical to align QRIS with accreditation – to make sure it all works together. People didn&#39;t want to see that set aside or not incorporated. </p>

<p>AMY: Mav is right. But there is an important difference in Massachusetts which is that getting accredited isn&#39;t a free pass on QRIS. In some states it is. There are about 23 states that have already implemented their own versions of QRIS. In a few of them accreditation bumps programs right to the highest level. In Massachusetts being accredited is one way for programs to demonstrate they&#39;ve met critical quality benchmarks. But to get to the highest level (Level 4) we&#39;ve got higher standards in some areas than to meet accreditation requirements - like educational attainment and experience for administrators and teachers or having a working sink in every classroom. </p>

<p><strong>STEFAN: What difference will QRIS actually make for families and kids? I am a parent. I walk into a center. What do I notice?</strong> </p>

<p>MAV: Right now not a lot. We&#39;re still early in the process. But over time you will see more highly qualified teachers better curriculum better physical environments. You will also see programs incorporating QRIS into their marketing – because being a QRIS Level 3 or 4 will send parents a strong signal. The savvier families will pick this up early. But we&#39;ll do outreach to others too. </p>

<p><strong>STEFAN: What does it say about QRIS that Governor Patrick got behind it even while making difficult cuts in so many other areas?</strong> </p>

<p>AMY: Obviously we&#39;re thrilled it&#39;s a priority for him. And it makes sense to be one now because this is about strengthening a system. It&#39;s not about funding one more initiative and hoping for best. It&#39;s a measurable way to talk about progress and where we want to be with respect to young children. It also positions Massachusetts to be competitive for federal money – especially the new Race to the Top Early Learning Challenge. </p>

<p>MAV: It also is perfectly consistent with the Governor&#39;s focus on closing the achievement gap – and for all of us with our eyes on that goal. These days at all levels of the education system people are recognizing that what happens to kids in the first five years has enormous impacts. So investments there make a lot of sense – but only if we invest in quality. </p>

<p><strong>STEFAN: What were some of the biggest challenges getting to this point?</strong> </p>

<p>AMY: Convincing practitioners this wasn&#39;t just one more hoop but part of a system and then coming to consensus about what defines quality. From the beginning Commissioner Killins was committed to making sure QRIS was owned by those in the field – not just imposed from on high. There was a community group of 50-60 people working together on the standards. Getting to consensus was challenging but so worth it. Everyone had input. </p>

<p><strong>STEFAN: What do you see as the next big challenge for the field and as QRIS goes to scale?</strong> </p>

<p>MAV: We are going to have to figure out how to come up with funding to help programs meet these new standards which is a tall order in an under-resourced field. Part of this will be taking a hard look at rate structure – especially in programs serving kids on federal subsidy. Subsidy rates are set every two years based on a national market rate survey of cost of care. Subsidies are set at 75% with parents expected to come up with 25%. But in Massachusetts where costs are higher than anywhere else in the country the subsidy ends up being closer to 50% of costs. That means programs are losing money on every child on a subsidy. And most programs I work with – including many in Boston – have over 80% of kids on subsidy. This is a big challenge.  Another big one is financing for facilities. We just did a facilities inventory across the State. We found that most programs don&#39;t even have a line item in their budgets for repairs or replacements. So if furnace breaks they&#39;re in financial crisis. We have to get much more creative about financing for facilities and equipment. </p>

<p><strong>STEFAN: Anything to add Amy?</strong> </p>

<p>AMY: Data and alignment. We&#39;ve got to be sure we&#39;re measuring the right things so that what we do pre-Kindergarten contributes to the critical outcomes – like third grade literacy. </p>

<p><strong>STEFAN: Well said. Thank you both for your time. Really. And for all you are doing for kids.</strong> </p>

<p>AMY: My pleasure. </p>

<p>MAV: Mine too.</p>"

102,Fueling Up for a New Conversation about Transportation Financing in Massachusetts,"<p>Since late this summer, Governor Patrick and Lieutenant Governor Murray have been calling for renewed debate – and an ""adult conversation"" – about transportation finance in the Commonwealth. Business-as-usual is 1) not sustainable and 2) can only undermine the State's aggressive climate and energy goals. Three recent reports offer rich fodder for that conversation to occur. Lizzi Weyant, Staff Attorney of MASSPIRG breaks them down to their key insights.</p>","<p><em>Late this summer and into the fall, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick and Lieutenant Governor Tim Murray have both been calling for renewed debate about how to fund transportation in the Commonwealth. Business-as-usual approaches have left the State with untenable levels of debt, annual budget shortfalls, and daunting backlogs in maintenance – resulting in steadily eroding safety, quality, and efficiency of all kinds of transportation. In Murray’s words, Massachusetts’ public transit systems, roads, and bridges constitute the “enabling network of our economy.” This makes solving the transportation finance puzzle critical for reviving the State’s economy. It is equally important for the administration given its ambitious climate and energy agenda. This is why Barr and many of its grantees are focused on this issue. Without a sustainable, high-quality transportation system, there is little hope of making real dents in vehicle-related emissions – which are the second highest source of greenhouse gas emissions (after buildings) in Massachusetts.</em></p>

<p><em>Murray and Patrick are calling for a new conversation between the public and policy makers – one that looks squarely at the scope of the challenges and puts all options on the table for figuring out how to sustainably fund the transportation network citizens want and need. Three recent reports seek to advance that conversation. We asked Lizzi Weyant, Staff Attorney of Barr-grantee <a href=""http://www.masspirg.org/"">MASSPIRG</a> to share the highlights from each report.</em></p>

<p>“<a href=""https://www.cambridgema.gov/%7E/media/Files/CDD/Transportation/transitcommittee/2014/Maxed-Out_20140507.pdf?la=en"">Maxed Out: Massachusetts Transportation at a Financing Crossroads</a>,” by the Transportation for Massachusetts Coalition (T4MA) details how the State’s long dependence on borrowed money, coupled with a lack of new revenue to pay off its substantial debt, has left all of the pieces of the Commonwealth’s transportation network unable to fund operations, maintenance, or construction projects. The report builds the case that, without new revenues, pressing transportation needs will go unmet in every part of the State and our aging transit systems, roads, and bridges, and will continue to deteriorate.</p>

<p>“<a href=""http://www.massinc.org/Research/Moving-Forward-with-Funding.aspx"">Moving Forward with Funding: New Strategies to Support Transportation and Balanced Regional Economic Growth</a>,” a new report by MassInc, points out that the financial situation has particularly affected communities that are served by regional transportation agencies (RTAs). RTAs provide service to some of the state’s most economically disadvantaged residents. “Moving Forward” draws attention to the significant unmet transportation needs in RTA service areas and calls for diversification of the funding base to support the Commonwealth’s transit agencies.</p>

<p>Highlighting the negative impact that reduced transportation funding has on two seemingly disparate populations, a third report, “<a href=""http://www.frontiergroup.org/our-research/transportation/reports-on-transportation/common-connections3"">Common Connections: The Importance of Public Transportation for College Students and Seniors in Massachusetts</a>,” released by MASSPIRG, details the unique benefits that public transportation provides students, seniors, their families, and the Commonwealth as a whole. Together, college students and senior citizens account for more than one out of every five Bay State residents, and account for nearly a quarter of the population served by RTAs.</p>

<p>That these three reports were released within days of each other is no coincidence. Their themes are consistent: a good transportation system, complete with robust public transportation options, is a lifeline for Bay State residents from the Berkshires to the Cape. Investments in our transportation system provide access to jobs and economic opportunity, and they make the Commonwealth a more attractive place to live, work, and play. If we want a 21st century answer to global climate change, economic development, and livability for all, then, as these three reports clearly illustrate, now is the time to tackle the important challenge of transportation finance.</p>

100,First Deep Look at Costs AND Benefits of Northeast Cap-and-Trade Program Shows it a Clear Winner,"<p>For three years, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) – a collaborative effort of 10 Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states – has been testing the nation's first cap-and-trade scheme to reduce carbon emissions.</p>","<p>For three years, the <a href=""http://rggi.org/"">Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI)</a> – a collaborative effort of 10 Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states – has been testing the nation’s first cap-and-trade scheme to reduce carbon emissions. The commitment from participating states has been wavering lately. New Jersey announced it would be pulling out. Some others are threatening to do the same. However, a <a href=""http://www.analysisgroup.com/rggi.aspx"">new report by the Boston-based Analysis Group</a> about the significant economic benefits RGGI has created already might give them pause.</p>

<p>Since the cap-and-trade scheme was launched in 2009, participating states have raised nearly $790 million from auction of emissions permits to utilities – which typically pass these costs along to their customers in the form of higher rates. While these costs have been widely reported from the onset, a clear-eyed view of the benefits side of the equation has been missing.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, thanks to the leadership of <a href=""http://www.merckff.org/"">The Merck Family Fund</a>, Barr joined with other funders – to support research to address this gap. We sought a well-respected, highly-qualified consulting firm to develop and share an objective, rigorous analysis of both costs and benefits of the RGGI cap-and-trade approach. Without that complete view, we knew there would be little hope of improving RGGI – let alone see it given serious consideration in other regions or nationally. With Barr’s particular focus on Massachusetts, we were also interested in seeing how investing proceeds back into energy efficiency (which Massachusetts did) compared to alternative approaches pursued by other states.</p>

<p>The report&#39;s key findings?</p>

<ul>
<li>$1.6 billion in economic value added to the regions economy </li>
<li>$1.1 billion in customer savings on electricity bills and $174 million on natural gas and heating oil bills over the next decade through installation of energy efficiency measures using funding from RGGI auction proceeds to date </li>
<li>16,000 jobs created across the region</li>
<li>$765 million kept in the local economy based on reduced demand for fossil fuels </li>
<li>Even though power plant owners experienced a $1.6 billion decline in revenue during the 2009-2011 period, overall they remained profitable as a result of RGGI</li>
</ul>

<p>As the Merck Family Fund notes <a href=""http://merckff.wordpress.com/2011/12/06/mff-initiated-economic-study-of-rggi-released/"">on their blog</a>, news of this report and its findings, “has reached local and national audiences with more than 11 million impressions in traditional and online media. The Baltimore Sun wrote in an editorial [&#39;<a href=""http://mobile.baltimoresun.com/p.p?a=rp&postId=1178829&m=b&sessionToken=&postUserId=46"">Cap and Economic Growth</a>&#39;] on Nov. 15th, &#39;Cap-and-trade isn’t the jobs killer that the naysayers claimed but a boost to the economy at a time when jobs are at a premium.&#39; The authors are now making the rounds with businesses, legislators, federal agencies, and even White House staff!”</p>

98,"Beyond Silver Bullets, the Levers for Change","<p>Risk, failure, silver bullets, systems thinking, and reaching beyond significant change to transformation – opening remarks from Pat Brandes at a breakfast meeting of the Massachusetts Education Innovators at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.</p>","<p><em>On December 7th, Pat Brandes was invited to speak at a breakfast meeting of a group called the Massachusetts Education Innovators. MEI is a collection of leaders from education non-profits, from city, district, and state offices of education, from unions, and from the legislature. The topic of the day was the role of “engaged funders” in accelerating innovation in education. Pat joined Paul Grogan, President of <a href=""http://www.tbf.org/"">The Boston Foundation</a> as featured presenters, then participated in a larger panel discussion with other Boston-area funders. Here’s what she said:</em></p>

<p>When Warren Buffet made his big gift to the <a href=""http://www.gatesfoundation.org/"">Gates Foundation</a>, he told the foundation staff that if they wanted to spur big change, they needed to fail fast and often. I think Barr would meet with Buffet’s approval on this score. Our history of grantmaking is littered with failures. Let me tell you about a whole portfolio of them.</p>

<p>For a long time, we had a strategy that we could fund great programs like many of those represented in this room, and that if and when they showed results, the district would adopt and scale them.</p>

<p>But it almost never worked like that – for a lot of reasons, including the fact districts aren’t always rational, however full they are of rational, smart, committed people. The forces of the status quo are powerful in bureaucracies and there are all manner of constraints.
You hear it so often, it is cliché that there are no silver bullets in education, but that doesn’t stop us from falling in love with them, or from being heartbroken when the research calls them into question.</p>

<p>In November, for example, The Washington Post ran a story under the headline, “<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/research-doesnt-back-up-key-ed-reforms/2011/11/12/gIQAPRoWFN_blog.html"">Research Does not Back up Key Ed Reforms</a>.” It opened with these words: “There is no solid evidence supporting many of the positions on teachers and teacher evaluation taken by some school reformers today.”</p>

<p>Drawing on more than 40 studies or syntheses of research it debunked ideas like merit pay being linked in any meaningful way to student gains.</p>

<p>It points out that the now-in-vogue tool for gauging teacher effectiveness– “value-added assessments” – is not reliable or stable. And it calls into question the mantra that, if a kid gets a string of top-tier teachers in a row, it can erase the achievement gap. As it turns out, that’s never been proven.</p>

<p>I could go on – we all remember the small schools silver bullet and many others.
But you get the point.</p>

<p>I think the good news is that we are all doing more research so that we’re learning what doesn’t work faster than we used to.</p>

<p>The bad news is that the pace of change is an outrage.</p>

<p>In my view we are in a crisis and for all the momentum the results are still not where they need to be. So maybe what we are missing is a deeper understanding of how change happens – particularly in complex, change-resistant systems like school districts.
Districts are antiquated bureaucracies from the former century. They are highly political. With property taxes as their funding mechanism, they are also mired in structural racism.</p>

<p>So, it can be instructive to look at reform from the perspective of systems thinking. To do that I turn to Donella Meadows, who was trained by the great Jay Forrester, the father of systems thinking, at the technology school across the river. Before she died in February 2001, Meadows wrote a piece called “<a href=""http://www.sustainer.org/pubs/Leverage_Points.pdf"">Leverage Points – Places to Intervene in a System</a>”. It is a classic.</p>

<p>She starts by recognizing our very human longing for silver bullets and then lists 12 types of levers for changing complex systems.
She ranks these levers based on their power to get big change in complex systems. It turns out we spend most of our time on the weakest ones – maybe because they are the easiest to move. This may be why the pace of change is slow.</p>

<p>The most powerful lever on Meadows’ list is to change the paradigm or mindset. For example – I think the public now believes that black and brown children can succeed in urban public schools. This has been a big paradigm shift – one that Boston’s charter schools deserve a big shout out for. They have changed the paradigm with high expectations for students and teachers. This is a huge lever for change!</p>

<p>Another critical mindset change that many of you are working on is that all urban children have the right to a good education, not just the children with parents who can get them into the better schools or who speak English as their native language.</p>

<p>This is why Boston’s District Charter Compact is so important – and why it is critical that we diversify who is recruited, enrolled, and retained in the charter schools. It is also why we must continue to shine a light on how ELL students are fairing.</p>

<p>Yet another paradigm shift is the one called personalized learning – it starts with the idea of multiple intelligences and travels all the way to sophisticated technologies for mass customization of learning. But the basic mind shift is that education is not a one-size-fits-all endeavor.</p>

<p>If you work on the lever of paradigm change - God bless you!</p>

<p>According to Meadows, the second most powerful lever is “setting the system goal” – articulating it repeatedly, standing up for it, and holding ourselves accountable to it. This one is critical for all of us and informs the rest of the conversation.</p>

<p>What are we after and how will we know we have gotten there?</p>

<p>Right now only 1.5 out of 10, BPS ninth graders go on to graduate from college – what should that number be? Three out of ten? That is the state average in Massachusetts – a state that arguably has the best education system in the nation.</p>

<p>Or is there a higher goal that defines a world class education?</p>

<p>Once we set the goals, do we also have ways to be transparent about progress? This is the work of core standards and testing and reporting on sub-groups and achievement gaps.</p>

<p>And this is the beauty of the <a href=""http://www.bostonopportunityagenda.org/"">Boston Opportunity Agenda</a> – we have community goals for everything from school readiness to graduation rates. We have agreement at a high level on goals and we are tracking them publicly.</p>

<p>Setting the goals is such an important lever that I want to come back to it later in my remarks.</p>

<p>The third most powerful lever is “self-organizing” or “self-evolving.”</p>

<p>If schools and districts can’t innovate, they’re doomed. And “self-evolving” innovation is not innovation by smart outsiders executed top-down. It is an unleashing of the potential of kids, families, teachers and administrators.</p>

<p>This is why <a href=""http://www.michaelfullan.ca/"">Michael Fullan</a> argues that so many of the current reforms being proposed are destined to fail. They lean too heavily on limiting variability.</p>

<p>Looked at through this lens, the <a href=""http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/sites/default/files/elibrary/bryk_organizing-schools_pdk.pdf"">Bryk study</a> of hundreds of Chicago elementary schools over 15 years makes sense. In schools that succeeded, Bryk found five common threads – four were about motivated individuals and groups:</p>

<ul>
<li>High quality professional capacity; </li>
<li>Strong parent-community-school ties;</li>
<li>A student-centered learning climate; and </li>
<li>Leadership that drives change.</li>
</ul>

<p>Empowered teachers. Empowered parents and communities. Empowered students. Empowered leaders. Organizing themselves around outcomes.</p>

<p>Bryk’s fifth element was “A coherent instructional system” which is an example of Meadow’s next lever (“Rules of the System”), but before I leave self-organizing, I want to point out one of the best recent examples we have in Boston – the <a href=""http://www.barrfoundation.org/news/emerging-plan-for-boston-takes-aim-at-link-between-zip-code-and-destiny"">Promise Initiative</a> – a whole community in the Dudley area that is self-organizing to bring change for thousands of kids in a set of schools.</p>

<p>Let me stop here on the levers and take a few more minutes to talk about the goals because I think it is provocative for a group like this:</p>

<p>What really is our goal – significant improvement or transformation? A good parallel to this is work on climate change, where the City and State have set a goal of 25% emissions reductions by 2020 and 80% by 2050.</p>

<p>25% by 2020 is significant change, don’t get me wrong. And no one has figured out exactly how to get it. But it is about low-hanging fruit and doing what we already do more efficiently. By contrast, 80% by 2050 means transformation of our economy.</p>

<p>And so it is in education. If we set the system goals right, if we unleash the power of self-organizing, and if we are smart about other systems levers I haven’t even talked about – like improving information flows – then maybe, just maybe we can double the college completion rate in Boston so that three out of ten (instead of 1.5 in ten) high school freshman hit that benchmark.</p>

<p>Barr has its priority list of what needs to be done to get there.</p>

<p>But to my mind that is the 25% by 2020 goal. Not easy. But not enough.</p>

<p>The only way to get to the public education equivalent of 80% by 2050 will be complete shifts in our paradigms and recalibrating our goals.</p>

<p>Shifts that allow us to imagine a world where we no longer see middle class flight and segregated school systems as inevitable, where the structural inequity of affordable housing located far from good jobs and schools becomes only a memory.</p>

<p>Chris asked us to tell you how to make a bigger, better difference faster. Earlier I lied to you – I said that Donella Meadows most powerful lever was paradigm change – actually greater than paradigm change is the ability to become unattached to paradigms –– to stay flexible so that we can see the black swan.</p>

<p>So my mantra – is stay outraged by the pace of change – but curious about where the next paradigm shift is coming from – it may be from somewhere else in the globe or from someone in this room like <a href=""http://www.nmefdn.org/foundation/profile.aspx?e=ndonohue@nmefdn.org&c=staff"">Nick Donohue</a> with mass customization of learning.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

97,The OPPORTUNITY City on a Hill,"<p>What would it take to make Boston the premiere ""opportunity city?""</p>","<p>In 2010, the <a href=""http://www.cityofboston.gov/"">City of Boston</a> and <a href=""http://www.bostonpublicschools.org/"">Boston Public Schools</a> teamed up with the City’s leading public charities and foundations – including Barr – to try answering that question. What emerged was the <a href=""http://www.bostonopportunityagenda.org/"">Boston Opportunity Agenda</a> (BOA) – a partnership committed to “to strengthening the comprehensive education pipeline that spans early childhood care and education through post-secondary achievement—with the ultimate goal of making Boston a place where upward mobility occurs for large numbers of people now living in poverty.“ This was by no means the first time a group of funders and city leaders lent their voices to a common vision of education as the pathway out of poverty. But it is the first time – at least in Boston – that this kind of partnership agreed on a set of indicators for what success looks like, and pledged to stay focused on data and accountable to the community. To make good on that pledge, BOA released <a href=""http://www.bostonfoundation.org/uploadedFiles/Sub_Site/web_specials/The_Boston_Opportunity_Agenda/BOA%20Report%20Card%202011.pdf"">its first annual report card</a> this September.</p>

<p>The report was released at the <a href=""http://www.blackstoneschool.com/"">Blackstone Elementary School</a>. At the event, funders of BOA’s major initiatives talked about work and progress to date, and then introduced a beneficiary of those initiatives to describe them from their point of view.</p>

<p>I spoke about BOA’s work with Boston Public Schools and <a href=""http://bostonbeyond.org/"">Boston After School and Beyond</a> to re-imagine summer school as a place that blurs the lines between learning and fun. And I previewed some of the promising results from the first two years of the pilot. I closed by introducing sixth grader, Marcos Suares, who proved to be the event’s real show stopper (see video below).</p>

<p>Here are my remarks:</p>

<p><em>Rahn DorseyAt the Barr Foundation, our education program aims to help close education opportunity gaps in Boston so achievement is no longer predicted by demographics or address. We share the Opportunity Agenda vision for a K-12 system that gives families in every part of the city access to high-quality, full-day, year-round learning opportunities. Because for Boston to become the opportunity city, learning can’t be limited to 180-days-a-year.</em></p>

<p><em>Just look at the research.</em></p>

<p><em>After the last bell of the year, summer learning loss accounts for up to half of the achievement gap. That’s why the Opportunity Agenda team focused on K-12 started with summer school.</em></p>

<p><em>Now, when I say, “summer school” what images come to mind?</em></p>

<p><em>Do you imagine a joyful place? A learning place?</em></p>

<p><em>Not if your image is like mine – at least my old image.</em></p>

<p><em>I grew up in Detroit. My mom was a career educator in the Detroit Public Schools. I remember visiting her classrooms some summers. What I saw, sitting in the back of her class was students slouched in their chairs, students giving long sighs and rolling their eyes, students making it clear in any number of ways that they didn’t want to be there.</em></p>

<p><em>In that environment, it almost didn’t matter how dedicated, how talented my mom was. To ignite an interest in learning among those students, to put them back on an opportunity path, those kids needed more than academic remediation. They needed more than another dose of what hadn’t worked for them during the year.</em></p>

<p><em>That’s why we’ve been doing a complete rethink of summer school. At a time when school districts across the country have been slashing budgets for summer programming, we’ve been investing in new ways to match the best of what schools have to offer with some amazing community partners. So these past two summers, our kids have had experiences that blur the lines between academics and fun. Math and science came alive in places like the Boston Nature Center, Hale Reservation, and Thompson Island. Theater and business planning met writing and literacy at Sociedad Latina and the Tobin School. Summer employment met college prep at the Burke High School through partnerships with the Private Industry Council and Freedom House.</em></p>

<p><em>At an event in December, we will share the full results of an evaluation of this work. But I’ll give you the punch line today – this rethink of summer school is proving itself an antidote to summer learning loss. It’s delivering on indicators of academic progress and whole child development.</em></p>

<p><em>And this change is raising all kinds of ideas for how to rethink those 180 days of in-school time.</em></p>

<p><em>But don’t take it from me.</em></p>

<p><em>It is my pleasure to introduce you to Marcos Suares. Born and raised in Boston, Marcos lives in Mission Hill. This summer, he participated in summer school program with Sociedad Latina, held at Simmons College. He is now a 6th grader at the Maurice J. Tobin School.</em></p>

<p><em>Marcos?</em></p>

94,"All Things Not Being Equal: Equity, Race, and Metro Boston",<p>What is the state of the American dream in Metro Boston? A new report takes a piercing look at how much the answer to that question still depends on race.</p>,"<p>Metropolitan Area Planning Council’s (MAPC) new <a href=""https://equityagenda.mapc.org/"">&quot;State of Equity in Metro Boston&quot;</a> was released at a December event at the Harvard Law School. The report was funded by Barr as part of its Climate portfolio. At the release, Barr Senior Program Officer Mary Skelton Roberts gave these opening remarks:</p>

<p>Thank you for that introduction. Thank you also to Marc Draisen and the rest of the MAPC staff for producing The State of Equity in Metro Boston report and for convening us here this evening. I am Mary Skelton Roberts. I work at the Barr Foundation, which provided funding for this report. This was actually one of the first grants I made as a Program Officer at Barr. I help manage Barr’s grantmaking related to Climate Change, where our goal is to make Boston and Massachusetts national models for reducing emissions – and so you may be wondering what in the world does climate change have to do with equity?</p>

<p>As it turns out, quite a lot. But rather than talk about that, let me tell you a story…</p>

<p>The offices of the Barr Foundation are on Lewis Wharf in the North End. I started there nearly three years ago. When I decided to accept the job, I called my sister in Maryland right away to tell her. She was thrilled for me. She fed on the excitement and energy in my voice – and like sisters we got talking faster and louder. But then she asked “where’s your office?” And when I said, “the North End,” there was silence on the other end of the line.</p>

<p>A long silence.</p>

<p>“It’s different now,” I said.</p>

<p>Why such a strong reaction?</p>

<p>Well, in the 1980s, my sister and I went to High School in the North End. And the memories I have of the North End from those years are not of freshly baked cannolis at Mike’s Pastry or al dente pasta at Prezza’s, Assaggio’s, or Mama Maria’s. My memories of the North End included a short walk from the Orange Line to Christopher Columbus School that did not feel like a short walk, because we were getting pelted with snowballs by classmates who clearly did not want us in their neighborhood.</p>

<p>I could not wait to graduate and get out of Boston. For me college wasn’t just a pathway to personal fulfillment and success. It was a one-way ticket out of this city. Even at 17 years old, my sister and I knew this was not a place where we could thrive. My sister left at 22.</p>

<p>But, like the rest of the nation, Boston and the North End have changed a lot since the 1980s. For one, I no longer get pelted by snowballs on my walk across the neighborhood – and that isn’t just because of climate change and our so far snow-less November and December. My alma mater, Christopher Columbus School, is no longer a school. It’s been converted to high-end condos. These days, open displays of racism just don’t fly. In fact, our public officials and business leaders, our organizational mission and values statements are full of open displays of commitments to diversity, inclusiveness, and multiculturalism. Those who do get caught making racist comments in the public square see their careers implode quite quickly. With a black president in the White House, many have taken to arguing that we are now in a post-racial society, that all that ugliness is behind us, that talking about race and class just divides people, at a time we need to come together to address the “real” issues.</p>

<p>But the problem with that story is that’s it’s just a story. And however appealing a story it may be, it falls apart in the face of the facts. Like the fact featured in this report – and which the Globe reported on Sunday [Yvonne Abraham’s “<a href=""http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2011/12/11/a_sad_statistic_that_endures/"">A Sad Statistic That Endures</a>”]– that a black woman with a college education is more likely to have a low-birth-weight baby than is a white woman who didn’t even finish high school. Or the fact that, in Metro Boston, blacks drop out of high school at twice the rate of their white and Asian peers. Latinos – more than three times as much. Or the many other difficult but important facts Marc will lead us through in a moment.</p>

<p>The real story is in The State of Equity – in the state of all things not being equal. It is the same story that President Obama told at his speech last week in Osawatomie, Kansas. He spoke of a time where “If you gave it your all, you’d take enough home to raise your family, send your kids to school, have your health care covered, and put a little away for retirement.” And he lamented the sad reality that America is looking less and less like the place it aspires to be, “where everyone can make it if they try.” When you actually look at the data, we are worse off now than we were fifty years ago. After World War II, a child born in poverty had about a five in ten chance of making it into the middle class. By the 1980s, their chances slipped to four in ten. Now it’s three in ten. These are grim findings, and difficult conversations to have. The State of Equity report makes clear that our work is far from over. If Metro Boston and Massachusetts are to remain competitive, we must create the space to advance the dialogue about the inequalities that exist here and embrace our new reality – there are significant structural inequalities that limit opportunities for huge segments of society. We can’t accept the argument that a rising tide will lift all boats because too many people in Metro Boston and across this country don’t even have a boat. And, more often than not those people are the poor. They are children. They are the elderly. And they are people of color.</p>

<p>Only when we face and accept these hard realities can we do the hard work of identifying the policies and interventions that will shift the tide – and to make this a place where every person has the opportunity to graduate well educated, to live where they choose, and to see Massachusetts as a viable place where they can realize their dreams and thrive – not somewhere they are trying to run away from.</p>

<p>That is my hope for my daughter – as she starts kindergarten this year at a school just a few miles from where I began school decades ago – but worlds apart in terms of the welcome she receives from her classmates and her community.</p>

<p>That is my hope for us all.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>"
93,More Racing to the Top in Massachusetts,"<p>In December 2011, Massachusetts was named one of only nine states to receive grants under the federal “Race to the Top – Early Learning Challenge,” a successor to the Obama Administration’s competitive K–12 “Race to the Top” program.</p>","<p>The State will get an infusion of as much as $50 million over four years to expand access to high-quality early care and education—and to continue strengthening the systems that support this expansion and ensure quality.

92,Come Together Right Now...,<p>How has Boston thrived in a resource-constrained era of fierce political divisions?</p>,"<p>In his <a href=""http://www.cityofboston.gov/Images_Documents/State_of_the_City_2012_tcm3-30137.pdf"">January 2012 State of the City address</a>, Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino opened with a question: How has Boston thrived in a resource-constrained era of fierce political divisions? The answer, argued the mayor, is that Boston has “refused to allow strained budgets to result in strained relationships. While others have been building walls, we have been building connections.”</p>

<p>One of the most critical recent connections he pointed to is the <a href=""http://www.cityofboston.gov/news/Default.aspx?id=5087"">District-Charter Compact</a>, which Mayor Menino described as an effort “to make sure all children in Boston—no matter where they go to school—receive a great education.”</p>

<p>The Compact was signed in April 2011 by the Boston Public Schools and the Boston Charter School Alliance, whose chairman is Kevin Andrews, founding headmaster of the <a href=""http://www.neighborhoodhousecharterschool.org"">Neighborhood House Charter School</a> and a member of the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/fellows/alumni"">2007 class of Barr Fellows</a>. Soon after, Pat Brandes, Barr’s executive director, sat down with Kevin to talk about the Compact and what it means for the city.</p>

<p><strong>Pat Brandes:</strong> In plain English, what is the District-Charter Compact?</p>

<p><strong>Kevin Andrews:</strong> First I’ll tell you what it is not. It is not a contract. It is a compact. It is an agreement to work together on issues that have divided charter and district schools for a long time. It is also an opportunity to vent concerns and to look at the whole picture of public schools in Boston—meaning both charter and district.</p>

<p><strong>Pat:</strong> What are the issues?</p>

<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> There are two kinds of issues. First are the immediate, front page of <em>The Boston Globe</em> issues, like transportation, facilities, special education, and English Language Learners (ELLs).</p>

<p>*<em>Pat:</em> The trigger points?</p>

<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Exactly. So, what the Compact does is say, “Let’s take a risk. Let’s begin this conversation and see what happens.” Just beginning that conversation is a minor victory unto itself.</p>

<p><strong>Pat:</strong> After the front-page issues, what else is there?</p>

<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> After the front-page, or “trigger,” issues, there is a lot for us to work through. There are issues of how to get teachers to work together. There are issues of how to develop leadership plans so we have a stronger core of leaders in both systems—charter and district. There are issues of improving teaching and learning, of sharing successful strategies, and in general how we plan for the long-term success of public education in Boston. To my mind, those are really the critical issues. But we won’t get to them until we deal with the more immediate ones.</p>

<p><strong>Pat</strong> What did it take to get us to this point?</p>

<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> The Gates Foundation made a big difference. They sponsored a two-day, overnight meeting in New York for districts and charters to come together. Michael Goar, deputy superintendent of the Boston Public Schools, and I both went. When people see the Gates Foundation they often get excited. They think big dollars. But in this case, I didn’t go to New York with money on my mind, and I doubt Michael did either. We both wanted to see how other districts were collaborating. We saw this as an opportunity. And something about the distance and the dedicated time away from Boston helped us to have a breakthrough.</p>

<p><strong>Pat:</strong> Why couldn’t it have happened sooner?</p>

<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> We couldn’t get past the politics—even though the Mayor may have wanted to. But the new legislation really changed the landscape. It gave more authority to superintendents to make big change. It also lifted the cap on charter schools to eighteen percent. So, in that new context, we had a first meeting with leaders of Boston charter schools, the superintendent, the Mayor’s chief of staff, and others from Boston Public Schools and City Hall. After that, we all met with the mayor at the Parkman House, and we presented a preliminary outline of what charter-district collaboration might look like in Boston. He got right on board and was excited by the possibility. I actually rode up the elevator with the mayor before that meeting. One of the first things he said to me—and he repeated it later to everyone—was, “I want to be mayor of all the kids in Boston.” If we’re going to do right by all kids, including special education and ELL, then we have to take a broader perspective. The solutions are bigger than Boston Public Schools. They’re bigger than the charters.</p>

<p><strong>Pat:</strong> What will be different in ten years if the Compact is a complete success?</p>

<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Families will have more choices of academically strong schools. Some will be charter. Some will be district. They’ll differ in many ways—curriculum, time, how they emphasize arts or sciences, and so on. But there will be a common thread of strong academics, and a common language for parents to be able to make educated choices.</p>

<p><strong>Pat:</strong> OK. But help me understand what makes the Compact a breakthrough? Why couldn’t we get to that vision without a District-Charter Compact?</p>

<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> First of all, let’s be cautious about the word “breakthrough.” We have agreements on paper. We got together and said, “OK, let’s try to do this.”</p>

<p><strong>Pat:</strong> Granted, but do you think that with two separate systems as we had before—charters over here and district over here—parents couldn’t experience the same level of choice?</p>

<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Prior to the Compact, we were fighting with one another. We were at loggerheads. And we fought through the media, not face to face. So the fighting was focused on the dollars, not on what is best for kids. The former superintendent, Thomas Payzant, and I tried to do some work together in that environment. Through the Project for School Innovation, we actually brought some charter and district schools together with a focus on sharing effective practice. But it was all under the radar. The politics remained a stumbling block to deeper work. In the press you had the left saying one thing and the right saying another, charters saying one thing and districts another. And we weren’t getting at the issues. The new legislation moved a lot of things, but we were still in different camps. The legislation added more flexibility into the system, but it took the Compact to make room for more conversation.</p>

<p>So, following that business-as-usual path… Sure, in ten years there would be some good choices for some families—and maybe even more than we have now. But the choices would remain uneven. There would be no cohesive strategies for the challenges that lie ahead. And I think the Compact holds out the possibility of a more level playing field. We create a system that is more one that two separate systems. Without the Compact, I don’t think we would have gotten to this point.</p>

<p><strong>Pat:</strong> So you expect to continue working with Michael Goar and Carol Johnson on the Compact?</p>

<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Absolutely, I do. We’ve been talking about the importance of relationships. And I think relationships are critical as we move forward. Nowhere are you going to find people who don’t say they’re in this work to do what’s best for kids. But to get through the politics, to get through these complicated issues, we’ve got to be able to reach outside our different camps and learn to trust each other, to work with each other. The charters and the district are now building upon what we’ve started in order to work through some very difficult issues. It will not be easy. But there is now much more trust at the conversation level than we’ve ever had before. The challenge before us now is to build the same level of trust with the follow through.</p>

<p><strong>Pat:</strong> Thanks for making the time to talk with me.</p>

<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> My pleasure.</p>"
91,New and Refined Directions for Early Education at Barr,<p>A 2011 strategy review of Barr’s approach to early education led to new and refined directions for this work in 2012 and beyond.</p>,"<p>In 2011, Barr took a fresh look at its early education strategy. We did this with help from <a href=""http://www.tpi.org"">The Philanthropic Initiative</a>, which interviewed thirty-five leaders, both locally and nationally, working to close opportunity and achievement gaps for our youngest children. While elements of Barr’s prior work will continue and be deepened, our early education portfolio will also be different in four important ways:</p>

<p><strong>1. Goal</strong>: Historically, Barr expressed its early education goal as “all children have access to quality.” Going forward Barr’s goal will be that “Boston’s children enter school ready to learn and are reading proficiently by third grade.” This change recognizes the need to focus not only on quality, but on outcomes for children.<br>
<strong>2. Outcomes</strong>: We will track outcomes of early language and literacy development, with a particular focus on first-grade literacy and third-grade reading scores.<br>
<strong>3. Target population</strong>: With a goal of school readiness and third-grade literacy, Barr will expand its target population from children ages three to five to children from birth to age five. Within this larger age range, we will prioritize low-income children, in particular those living in Boston’s “Circle of Promise” and English Language Learners.<br>
<strong>4. Focus areas</strong>: Barr will invest in public policy and advocacy, and in demonstration projects focused on 1) strengthening parents and caregivers as their children’s first teachers; and, 2) bridging early and elementary education to limit the “fade out” effect, where gains from high-quality pre-kindergarten programs are lost in the early elementary grades.</p>

<p>As we work to deepen our understanding of the needs of children from birth to age three and explore potential investments, 2012 will be a year of research and development for Barr. Some additional detail about these emerging directions is already <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/education"">on our website</a>. As we further develop our thinking and approach through logic models and strategic narratives, we will post those as well.</p>

<p>As always, we welcome reactions and ideas for continually improving our strategies and advancing these goals. If you wish to share insights, experience, and creative ideas, we invite you to e-mail us at <span data-email=""href"" data-subject="""">href</span>.</p>"
90,Talking ELL's in BPS,"<p>Over two years ago, the Gaston Institute at UMass Boston issued a scathing report on the status of English Language Learners in the Boston Public Schools.</p>","<p>Two years ago, the <a href=""http://www.umb.edu/gastoninstitute/"">Gaston Institute</a> issued a scathing report on the status of English Language Learners (ELL’s) in BPS. Soon thereafter, Dr. Eileen de los Reyes was appointed Assistant Superintendent for the <a href=""http://www.bostonpublicschools.org/ELL"">ELL Department</a>. A year later, BPS reached an agreement with the Department of Justice, which had been investigating the district on behalf of ELL students. Recently, Pat Brandes sat down with Claudio Martinez – a <a href=""http://www.barrfoundation.org/fellows/classes/class-of-2005"">Class of 2005 Barr Fellow</a>, Executive Director of <a href=""http://www.hydesquare.org/"">Hyde Square Task Force</a>, Boston School Committee member, and Co-Chair of the English Language Learners Task Force. They talked about what it’s taken to move this work forward, what’s different now for kids and their families and for teachers and their schools, and what to expect on the road ahead.</p>

<p>Pat Brandes (PB): In your opinion, where are we today with respect to ELL’s in BPS?</p>

<p>Claudio Martinez (CM): The last two years we have been dealing with ten or more years of neglect and confusion on this front. Initially, we were trying to find 5,000 ELL students who went “missing” in our system. We tested 7,000 of them to figure out what level they were at. Today, we have 16,000 ELL’s who are Limited English Proficient (LEP&#39;s) and 5,000 who are Former ELL’s (FLEP&#39;s), which is approximately 40% of our student population. At the same time, we integrated the ELL Department into BPS senior management, a new status. We have also worked to coordinate the ELL team with the Special Needs Department, as well as Family and Student Engagement. There has been consistent, forward momentum and progress on many fronts. And I think there is now a shared sense that we can never slip back to the way things used to be.</p>

<p>PB: What is behind the momentum?</p>

<p>CM: It comes from all levels. Internally, the Superintendent has given a lot of attention to these issues, so has the School Committee, which has embraced the direction that Dr. Eileen de los Reyes and Dr. Carol Johnson are taking. Thousands of teachers have voluntarily attended what we call “category trainings” in ELL. Even though these are only the bare minimum teachers need to support ELL students, they signify a larger cultural shift that is underway in BPS. Unfortunately, I don’t think that the community has the same feeling of momentum yet. There is still a lot of confusion among families about what the district offers and how to help their kids succeed.</p>

<p>PB: Why is that?</p>

<p>CM: A big part is school assignment. Just like for any child, the education of ELL students depends largely on which schools they attend. We don’t have the same levels of resources and ELL services in every school. And it is an enormous piece of work to ensure ELL students needing services don’t end up in regular education classrooms with limited or no services ever again.</p>

<p>PB: Which often happened before?</p>

<p>CM: Yes, it did.</p>

<p>PB: So, how does it work now?</p>

<p>CM: Step one – a family goes to register for school at a Family Resource Center. When a coordinator there discovers that English is not the family’s primary language, then – step two – the child and family are sent to the Newcomers’ Assessment Center. There, the child is fully tested, which is a lengthy process – and the source of many complaints. Then, step three – and this is one clear improvement – a member of the ELL staff is at the Newcomers’ Assessment Center to advise the family about school choices. Yet, when – step four – the family returns to the Family Resource Center, they are sometimes told, “Well, there are no more seats at that school.”</p>

<p>PB: So, there is no real-time connection?</p>

<p>CM: Exactly. That is why we are working to streamline school assignment with school organization. In my view, one way to solve this would be to empower the ELL Department with assignment authority, so they could reserve seats and assign students to schools they think will be the best fit, all of this with parent approval and buy in.</p>

<p>PB: Is that idea part of the larger conversation now underway about school assignment?</p>

<p>CM: It is one of the recommendations of the ELL Task Force. I keep bringing it up. But “busing” is one of the most political issues in all of BPS – maybe even the whole city of Boston.</p>

<p>PB: For teachers that have lived through these reforms, what feels different?</p>

<p>CM: Well, at a minimum, as a teacher I have participated in three trainings that have given me some strategies for helping ELL kids. Hopefully, I now have a principal who has embraced the concept that half or more of our kids are multicultural, and who is providing me the right tools and support to do my work. I also have an ELL department that is a resource for ideas and help. That is the ideal. In reality, unfortunately, I know there are administrators, teachers, principals, parents and students who probably feel resentful about these new developments both pragmatically and ideologically. Unfortunately, the ENGLISH ONLY fears about multilingualism (which created the mess we are trying to fix today via Question 2) are deep, ugly, and, unfortunately still alive and well in this City, State, and Country.</p>

<p>PB: So, part of the resentment is because you’ve made my job harder?</p>

<p>CM: Yes – and you can quote me on that. But hopefully I have also made your job more gratifying because you are more effective with a population of students that desperately needs you. These kids represent the growing population of Boston and the U.S. already, and they will continue to for years to come.</p>

<p>PB: What gives you the most hope?</p>

<p>CM: The Superintendent has been a force to move this conversation forward. Her discourse is inspiring. It has created a culture where, it would now be embarrassing to suggest we ignore these kids or to say, as some did in the very recent past, that there’s no problem. What also makes me hopeful is that the ELL Department and ELL Task Force are not only thinking about ELL students. We are proposing a vision of a multicultural system – one where every kid has opportunities to learn a second language. More and more people are embracing the idea of giving our kids a second language and cultural proficiencies to better compete in globalized societies.</p>

<p>PB: They certainly are embracing that idea in the suburbs. Kids are racing to learn Chinese.</p>

<p>CM: In BPS, our largest ELL population is Spanish speakers, and they get a lot of our attention and focus. But there are so many other major and growing language groups in Boston. Last year, I was invited to speak at graduation for <a href=""http://www.englishhs.org/"">English High School</a>. Before I spoke, the principal did his whole presentation with a translator in Somali after doing the same in Spanish. I was so shocked to hear that. I expected maybe Spanish. When I stepped to the microphone, the first thing I did was to apologize to the Somali community. I was embarrassed for not even knowing how to greet them in their own language. It was a lesson for me into the kind of work that still needs to be done. It was also inspiring to be reminded we have principals, teachers, and many others thinking like this and leading by example.</p>

<p>PB: Is there anything I missed?</p>

<p>CM: As we talk about success, it is fascinating when you look at the valedictorian class each year and you see all these very recent immigrant kids succeeding. The English High School valedictorian was one – a girl from Guinea, who came to this country by herself. She had not had much formal education. Yet, with the right support – wherever that support comes from – the community, the family, BPS, a mentor – it makes a huge difference. Just an amazing story. And it calls the question of why so many native English students are struggling to succeed. This is, I think, the Zapatista question we encountered on our trip to Chiapas with the Barr Fellows – the question of how the community never moves faster than its slowest members. Because our challenge is a group of kids, who are the majority of our kids in BPS, who need new approaches, a lot of patience, and a lot of time. Even the best of us don’t always feel we have the kind of time, patience, and resources it takes to deliver an effective, state-of-the-art education.</p>

<p>PB: I don’t have the answers. But it is good to end on an important question.</p>

<p>CM: I am glad that you and Barr find this question to be an important one. Thank you.</p>

<p>PB: Thank you.</p>"
87,From Boston to Haiti – A Barr Fellows Learning Journey,"<p>In January, 2012, a group of twelve Barr Fellows spent a week together in Haiti, during what was also the two-year anniversary of Haiti's devastating 2010 earthquake. I had the opportunity to join them to help document the trip...</p>","<p>The <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/fellows"">Barr Fellowship</a> is a recognition of extraordinary nonprofit leaders working in Boston. It is also an investment in their learning and connection with each other—often through travel together outside the city. In January 2012, a group of 12 Barr Fellows, including representatives from each class, took part in one such trip to Haiti. I had the opportunity to join them and to help document the trip through images, video, and now this post.</p>

<p>As with trips in years past to New Orleans or Chiapas, Mexico, this one was designed to give Fellows opportunities to immerse themselves in contexts of scarce resources and great challenges, where they could meet and connect with leaders of local and international groups working in various ways to bring positive change. Over a week that included the two-year anniversary of the 2010 earthquake, our itinerary exposed us to the full spectrum of life as it is now lived in Haiti.</p>

<p>...from the <a href=""http://www.karibehotel.com"">Karibe Hotel</a> in the lovely Pétionville neighborhood of Port au Prince, which stood across a valley from tents and concrete blocks of homes clinging to steep, rubble-strewn hills...through Port au Prince proper, past the devastated Presidential Palace, and the tented camps—still home to over half a million people...to the United Nations compound for a conversation with Heiner Rosendal, the UN’s Head of Civil Affairs.</p>

<p>...to Hotel Villa Ban-Yen, a mountain-top eco-lodge, where the peasant association, <a href=""http://www.vallue.org"">Association des Paysans de Vallue</a>, is improving lives through education, health care, and micro-enterprise.</p>

<p>…to the bustling charcoal market in Archaie, which is a central hub of a trade that has reduced Haiti’s forest cover to a paltry and ecologically unsustainable 2%—a trade whose participants are literally robbing from their own future to eke out a meager living; and the reason why satellite images of the single island of Hispaniola show a lush, green Dominican Republic on one side and a barren, brown, denuded Haiti on the other.</p>

<p>…to the idyllic <a href=""http://www.moulinsurmer.com"">Moulin Sur Mer</a>, a Haitian family-owned beach resort on the grounds of what was once a sugar plantation—a past preserved and on display in its museum.</p>

<p>…to the small village of Corail, where the flag of an independent Haiti was first raised and a small nonprofit called <a href=""http://www.hopeonastring.org"">Hope on a String</a> is working to foster community and economic development through music in a town without electricity, running water, or paved roads.</p>

<p>…to much more than I can do justice to here.</p>

86,Barr Announces Awards to 15 Boston Arts Organizations Under New Grant Program,"<p>Can you imagine Boston without its vibrant cultural life? We can't, either. Yet, a difficult economy and the departure of several longtime arts funders have created a ""new normal"" for arts in Boston. After many conversations with arts grantees about how best to respond, Barr is taking a new approach to its arts grantmaking—providing deeper, longer-term support for cohorts of mid-sized arts organizations.</p>","<p>We can’t imagine Boston without its vibrant cultural life. Yet, a difficult economy and the departure of several longtime, institutional funders have created what many have described as a “new normal” for arts funding in Boston. In light of this changing context, in 2011, Barr began a process to explore how best to focus its arts and culture giving. We held one-on-one interviews and multiple group meetings with grantees. We also conferred with local and national funders.</p>

<p>What emerged was <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/arts-creativity"">a more targeted strategy</a> that is focused on two areas the Foundation has supported since its inception—mid-sized arts organizations and youth arts programs that help young people achieve mastery in an art form. Beginning in 2012, Barr will provide deeper, longer-term support for cohorts of mid-sized arts and cultural institutions (with annual budgets of $1–$25 million), and for organizations providing opportunities for young people to pursue excellence in the arts. Our focus on cohorts is a direct response to grantees, who noted that declining arts funding in Boston had resulted in fewer forums to share strategies, to learn together, and to coordinate collective action focused on drawing new funding to Boston arts organizations.</p>

<p>Starting in the fall of 2011, Barr issued its first open requests for concept papers. We are pleased to introduce the mid-sized arts organizations that will receive support under this new program:</p>

83,The Currency of Social Change,<p>A new Stanford Social Innovation Review case study featuring the Barr Fellowship explores the surprising return on an investment in relationships among social change leaders—even without set expectations or requirements about what might emerge as a result.</p>,"<p>There is a lively discussion underway in the social sector about what it means to be “outcomes-focused” and the idea of “collective impact,” which was also the title of <a href=""http://www.ssireview.org/articles/entry/collective_impact"">an article in the Winter 2011 edition of the <em>Stanford Social Innovation Review</em></a> (SSIR). In it, co-authors Mark Kramer and John Kania of FSG describe “collective impact” as an antidote to a common challenge in the sector—where “countless teachers, administrators, and nonprofits, together with billions of dollars in charitable contributions” produce only isolated improvements, not system-wide gains. Kramer and Kania look at exceptions to this rule—successful cross-sector collaborations like <a href=""http://www.strivetogether.org"">STRIVE</a> in Cincinnati and <a href=""http://www.somervillema.gov/departments/health/sus"">Shape up Somerville</a> in Somerville—and they conclude that large-scale social change requires broad coalitions and five critical conditions: “a common agenda, shared measurement systems, mutually reinforcing activities, continuous communication, and backbone support organizations.”</p>

<p>Now, a new case study from SSIR, <a href=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/25/attachments/Networking_a_City_(Stanford_Social_Innovation_Review).pdf"">“Networking a City,”</a> introduces what may prove to be a vital sixth condition—what the magazine dubs the “return on relationships” and what is more commonly referred to as social capital. The case study features the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/fellows"">Barr Fellowship</a> and the novel idea that the bonds of trust and respect that form among leaders are truly the “currency of social change.” The Barr Fellowship is an investment specifically in those connections—without set expectations or requirements about what might emerge as a result.</p>

<p>Yet, in time, the Fellows’ collective impact on the city of Boston is becoming increasingly clear—with a few of the many good examples featured in the SSIR case study. In the words of one Barr Fellow, <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/fellows/classes/class-of-2007/louis-casagrande"">Lou Casagrande</a>, a member of the Class of 2007, “We’ve done one-off projects on a limited scale, affecting hundreds of people. Now we’re starting to do work affecting thousands of people, and we’re seeing the payoff in the investment of time, money, and resources to build this network.”</p>

<p>The Barr Fellowship was designed based on a body of research on networks, including work by Peter Plastrik and Madeleine Taylor, Jane Wei-Skillern, and others.</p>"
82,Announcing Barr's New Senior Program Officer for the Arts,<p>We are delighted to announce the appointment of Roxbury native San San Wong as Senior Program Officer in the Arts...</p>,"<p>We are delighted to announce the appointment of San San Wong as Senior Program Officer in the Arts, effective August 13, 2012. San San brings rich experience in arts administration, innovative program development, and philanthropy to Barr. Currently, she is at the <a href=""http://www.sfartscommission.org/"">San Francisco Art Commission</a>, where she has served as Director of Grants and Program Director, Cultural Equity Grants Program. At the Commission, she has worked to strengthen the arts community through expanded knowledge-building activities, convenings and funder collaborations, and launched initiatives such as Arts &amp; Communities: Innovative Partnerships, and the Creative Capacity Fund.</p>

<p>San San’s prior experience includes project management and design for such institutions as the Ford Foundation, the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, and the New England Foundation for the Arts. She has served as interim director for Theater Artaud and ODC Theater, and as Executive Director of the National Performance Network. Her experience as a member of funding allocation panels includes the Rasmuson Foundation, the East Bay Community Foundation, National Endowment for the Arts, and the Silicon Valley Arts Council.</p>

<p>San San has a BS from Smith College and an MS in community psychology from New York University. While she has lived and worked in San Francisco and New York, San San grew up in Roxbury and has family ties here. For our first program officer to be focused full-time on the arts, we were seeking a candidate with experience in arts management and philanthropy. We also hoped to find someone who has actively promoted civic arts policy and the engagement of new donors and whose enthusiasm spans the disciplines. San San brings all this to the table and more. We hope that our Boston colleagues will join us in welcoming her back to the Hub and to the shared work of strengthening our cultural sector.</p>

<p>During the search, Barr’s arts grantmaking has been ably handled by Cuong Hoang of <a href=""http://www.mottphilanthropic.com/"">Mott Philanthropic</a>. Cuong’s thoughtful management and knowledge of the cultural community has been a huge asset for us during this transition, and we want to express our appreciation to him, his associates at Mott, and to Manikka Bowman, a <a href=""http://temp-proteusfund.gaiahost.net/special-projects/diversity-fellowship"">Proteus Foundation Diversity Fellow</a> for their work on our <a href=""http://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/arts-culture"">Mid-Sized and Youth Arts Mastery funding initiatives</a>.

81,On Indigenous Leadership,"<p>What does it take to create a community that meets all the needs of its residents—a place rich in local resources that enhance health and safety, a place that provides people with a strong sense of connection to one another, and a place that celebrates life and hope through civic engagement, arts, and culture?</p>","<p>A Barr Fellow takes up these question and talks about how this kind of community is already being created in a Boston neighborhood once described as the “cocaine capital of New England.” In the process, he also challenges nonprofits and foundations from Boston to Haiti to think and act differently if they want to see this kind of thing happen more widely.</p>

<p>In March 2012, Barr Fellow <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/fellows/classes/class-of-2005/claudio-martinez"">Claudio Martinez</a> received the <a href=""http://www.fundersnetwork.org/events/nicholas-p-bollman-award"">Nicholas P. Bollman Award</a> from the Funders’ Network for Smart Growth and Livable Communities at its national conference. In his acceptance speech, Claudio spoke of the youth in his <a href=""http://www.hydesquare.org"">Hyde Square Task Force</a> and the ways they are finding both their voice and their power to lead real, lasting, positive change in their community. He juxtaposes this with reflections from his <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/from-boston-to-haiti-a-barr-fellows-learning-journey"">travels with a group of Barr Fellows to Haiti in January</a>. It all adds up to a provocative challenge to nonprofits and foundations to do a better job of investing in indigenous leadership. For those committed to place and willing to take the long view of change, Claudio argues that this is the only way to help people “control their own destinies and put together the pieces that create a vibrant, safe, and joyful urban community.”</p>

<p>The speech got a standing ovation from its audience of funders in Seattle, says Ben Starrett, executive director of the Funders’ Network, in a recent guest post on the Council of Foundation’s Re: Philanthropy blog—<a href=""http://www.cofinteract.org/rephilanthropy/?p=5300"">“Recognizing Visionary Leaders”</a>. Ben also talks about Nicholas Bollman, in whose name the award is given, and the kind of leaders the award aims to recognize.</p>

<p>Here is Claudio&#39;s speech in full:</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Good morning and thank you so much for inviting me here to receive this recognition today. I never knew Mr. Bollman, but I understand that many of you have powerful memories of a man who is described as “a beacon of hope.” It is truly an honor and a privilege for me to travel from Boston to receive an award that carries the name and spirit of a leader like Nicholas Bollman.</em></p>

<p><em>I am a long-time resident of Hyde Square, a neighborhood in Boston that many low-income immigrants, Latinos, and African Americans call their home. At Hyde Square Task Force, we don’t often use words like “smart growth” and “livable community” to describe our work. But they are perfect words to describe the end result we are hoping for—a community that has built an environment that meets many of the working and living needs of our residents, that has local resources to enhance health and safety, that has a strong sense of connection to one another, and that celebrates life and hope through civic engagement, arts, and culture.</em></p>

<p><em>But why is this little neighborhood in Boston so well known? I believe it is because our teenagers have been and are at the center of demanding and creating changes to improve their community, health centers, housing, train and bus stations, parks, and schools.</em></p>

<p><em>And these teens don’t just complain and demand from others to do it. They lead by example, working every day to improve the centers of civil society in our neighborhood and our city. This is where and how they learn to think critically about the inequities and discrimination they face every day.</em></p>

<p><em>For example, they tutor younger kids and teach peers in our schools and health centers. And this is how they learned what really goes on in these institutions. They work there, and as Dr. Manuel Pastor was suggesting yesterday, they sometimes even work alongside “the enemy” in putting together the jigsaw puzzle. But sometimes they also play a little chess when they have to and they sure know how to punch back if necessary. They don’t just get together with people that think like them and cry oppression expecting power to give a damn about it. They do the hard personal work and the hard community work that it takes to bring liberation. And during this journey of thinking and sweating, they organically become leaders in their community.</em></p>

<p><em>Over the past decade, the list of their community organizing accomplishments is truly impressive. Youth, supported by adults, have had major success in reclaiming a once drug- and violence-infested neighborhood (called by the DEA the “cocaine capital of New England”), in bringing comprehensive sexual education and civics education to the public schools, in pushing the government to renovate our parks and improve basic city services, increasing teen jobs, voter registration, and celebrating Afro-Latin culture.</em></p>

<p><em>Most of our teens’ parents are immigrants, many undocumented, and English is their second language. Most of the youth are underperforming students and uninvolved in creative and fun activities. In many ways they are invisible in their schools and invisible to many Boston and Massachusetts residents as well; many of them are not heading toward college but they are not in a gang either, as many would like us to believe. We see their potential and invite them in. In spite of their challenges, they use their energy and capacity to create a healthy, vibrant, safe, and joyful community.</em></p>

<p><em>For many of these teens living in Hyde Square, especially those for whom English is a second language, these experiences are the first time anyone has listened to them or taken them seriously. We don’t want them to be silent anymore. We work with them to find their voices and use them for good. Once they start working and speaking out they begin to understand their power and the complication of using power for the benefit of others. But that’s when they become engaged and bring that engagement back into their schools, improving their grades, graduating from high school, and doing post-secondary work as well as attending and completing college.</em></p>

<p><em>Boston is a majority-minority city that is searching, in theory, for a next generation of leaders that includes people of color from disadvantaged communities historically excluded from civil society. Through their work in their neighborhood and schools, our Latino and African-American teens and young adults are being trained to take on those leadership positions ensuring that everyone will be represented in the halls of power and all communities will have equitable access to resources and opportunities.</em></p>

<p><em>But as you know, some of you better than others, this journey to become visible is still too hard to travel for most of these teens and for most adults in our communities, including many of us here today. Indigenous leadership—people who live and work in distressed communities to bring positive change and are reflective of the demographics of those communities—is not yet a very popular concept even in the most “progressive” or “revolutionary” circles.</em></p>

<p><em>If we are going to achieve the dreams that Manuel, Denis Hayes of the Bullitt Foundation, and “Funk Master Fong” (a.k.a. Richard Woo of The Russell Family Foundation) described in their great presentations yesterday, we are going to need to figure out how to better support these types of long-term, community-governed efforts. This—development of indigenous leadership—is what creates and strengthens civil society and the fabric of all our communities, the relationships that sustain people in need for the long term. Not the new program of the month from the next venture philanthropist of the week.</em></p>

<p><em>I spent the first 10 days of this year in Haiti, a country with the second-highest nonprofits-per-capita ratio in the world and very little to show for it. Very few of these nonprofits are governed, managed, or staffed by Haitians. Somehow we think we can do it for them without them. In Boston, the NGOs and their funders, as well as the government and the private sectors, the unions, and many so-called social justice organizations, unfortunately, are not that different from the NGOs in Haiti when it comes to promoting or excluding intelligent and outspoken indigenous leaders at the higher levels of their organizations.</em></p>

<p><em>It has become clear to me that unless we equip, support, and walk with the people we want to “help,” our efforts will never yield the results we are looking for. It is not enough that we build green affordable housing if people in the community are not part of the process in an honest way. That means they have a role at the higher levels of decision making, not just a cameo appearance during a charette process.</em></p>

<p><em>At many foundations, we give millions of dollars to “high impact,” “business-oriented” nonprofits that employ “evidence-based measurement tools” and are often led by—don’t get me wrong, they are well meaning and well pedigreed, but they are also more often than not—outsiders. So please spare me the business case about rigor, and outcomes-focus, and high impact until your board, staff, contractors, services providers, and investment management companies include women and people of color as well as indigenous leaders. “High-impact” leaders and boards that parachute into our neighborhood but will never raise their kids here are an empty promise.</em></p>

<p><em>How come we so seldom invest equally in locally-governed organizations, run by local leaders, with real dollars, long term? Apparently they are not good enough. The local capacity just isn’t there is what they kept telling us in Haiti, and what we often tell ourselves when we make our funding decisions in our own communities. But somehow we expect these organizations, people, and communities to thrive and progress? Let’s walk with them and let’s not confuse pity for empathy. Boston, I’m sad to report, is not that different from Port-au-Prince when it comes to this issue of exclusion of indigenous leaders.</em></p>

<p><em>And when I say “we” I include myself in the family of foundations, nonprofits, and government bodies. As a board member of The Boston Foundation, the Nellie Mae Foundation, and as a Fellow and advisor to the Barr Foundation, I know firsthand how we help, and how we don’t help, to promote and increase “indigenous leadership” and participation in our city. As a high school drop-out, ironically today, I am the only immigrant and the only Latino member of Boston’s appointed School Committee that oversees a system where more than 60% of students are Latino or immigrant. Still less than 10% of teachers are Latino or immigrant.</em></p>

<p><em>As for education, Dr. Pastor mentioned Germany yesterday. In my opinion, the reason Germany is doing so well is they have embraced rigorous technical and vocational education. We need educational systems that lead to employment in the jobs of the future. The U.S. has a troubled racial history with regards to vocational education and must fix it ASAP. I welcome all of you to check the Nellie Mae Foundation proposals for changing our educational systems. As a father of a recent college graduate from one of the most expensive universities in the U.S., I wish my son knew how to fix an electrical fuse (or at least know what an electrical fuse is) instead of calling me every time an electrical appliance stops working.</em></p>

<p><em>Too much education—too little knowledge.</em></p>

<p><em>The lack of people living in distressed communities at the higher levels of decision-making in Boston’s government, nonprofit, civil society, and private sectors only leads to more civic disengagement in our communities and no outside “high-impact” organization or initiative is going to change that.</em></p>

<p><em>As the speakers suggested yesterday, to strengthen our civil society, we need to identify and invest in leaders and networks of unlikely partners. That means grassroots organizers, nonprofit, business, and government leaders. And it means investing in the development of indigenous leaders and organizations that give the tools and opportunities to the most vulnerable youth and families in our neighborhoods. I believe that is the only way we can ever help them to control their own destinies and put together the pieces that create a vibrant, safe, and joyful urban community.</em></p>

<p><em>Will Boston and the U.S. create the systems, networks, pathways, and opportunities for our hard-working youth to be invited and welcomed to solve the jigsaw puzzle that will ensure our survival on earth? I sure hope so.
Or will these youth find it too difficult a journey, not worth the sacrifice, and exit like so many of our youth and our friends in the past?</em></p>

<p><em>I am here today because of the hard work of thousands of young people in my neighborhood who still so patiently believe it is possible to lead a meaningful and dignified life in the U.S.A. So on behalf of them and hundreds of youth activists and organizers in Boston and beyond, I accept the 2012 Nicholas Bollman Award.</em></p>

<p><em>Thank you so much to all you members of Funders’ Network and for this honor and for your support!</em></p>

77,A Double Bottom Line Win in Massachusetts,<p>Some low-income residents can spend up to 40% of their incomes on energy and that building emissions are unnecessarily high.</p>,"<p>Ten percent of housing in Massachusetts is affordable housing. Many of these units are highly inefficient. This means some low-income residents can spend up to 40% of their incomes on energy and that building emissions are unnecessarily high. Property managers for these units typically operate with razor thin margins. This makes it difficult to access the human and financial resources to make energy upgrades – even though the potential economic and environmental benefits are substantial.</p>

<p>Facing this challenge, Barr provided support in early 2009 for a group of low income and affordable housing advocates to work with utility companies (which run efficiency programs in Massachusetts). Together, they designed a new program focused on energy upgrades in affordable housing. The initial budget was $22 Million.</p>

<p>The next step was to help the affordable housing community access these new resources – which required a level of knowledge and technical expertise few in the sector had. Barr gave a grant to <a href=""http://www.bostonlisc.org/"">Boston LISC</a> and <a href=""http://www.newecology.org/"">New Ecology</a> to test a novel approach to close this gap. Calling it the, “Green Retrofit Initiative,” the team offered their support as a one-stop-shop to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Benchmark utility consumption in all units to identify the biggest opportunities to improve efficiency</li>
<li>Connect with funding from multiple sources, including utility programs and local and federal grants</li>
<li>Link participants to a learning network to trade information and strategies</li>
</ol>

<p>The results?</p>

<p>The group partnered with 11 different community development corporations with oversight of over 5,000 units of affordable housing. After benchmarking these, more than 2,000 received guidance on how to finance and implement the energy upgrades. So far, these units are showing a 19% reduction in energy use. This means fewer carbon emissions to be sure. It also means lower costs for tenants who pay for utilities directly; lower costs for property owners who foot the utility bill themselves (reducing pressure to increase rents); and more comfortable homes and long-term housing stability for tenants.</p>

<p>In 2012, based on these results, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development provided a $1 Million grant to expand the pilot to all owners of affordable housing statewide.</p>

<p>The Green Retrofit team also produced a short video (below) about how they did it and featuring one of the residents, who talks about the difference the work is making for her.</p>

76,Authentic Relationships and Unintended Consequence,"<p>What would it take for a group of nonprofit leaders to be honest, open, and trusting enough with a funder to really share their wisdom—even their critiques of strategy and of how philanthropy works? For Barr, the answer was a happy accident of another challenge we were trying to address.</p>","<p>Since <a href=""http://www.barrfoundation.org/news/the-currency-of-social-change/"">“Networking a City”</a>—a case study on the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/fellows"">Barr Fellowship</a>—appeared in the Summer 2012 issue of the <em>Stanford Social Innovation Review</em>, we’ve been doing some more writing and guest-blogging about the Fellowship and what we have been learning from it.</p>

<p>By way of a quick round up…</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.bethkanter.org/love"">“The Collective Impact of Love”</a> was a guest post by Barr’s Stefan Lanfer on Beth Kanter’s blog summarizing some of the key findings of the SSIR case study, in particular the idea of love as a potent force for social change.</li>
<li>Stefan expanded on this idea in <a href=""http://blog.tpi.org/blog/impact-at-first-love"">“Impact at First Love”</a> for The Philanthropic Initiative’s Deep Social Impact blog, offering the Fellowship as one example of an approach to philanthropy that “blends both art and science—one that depends on logic, left-brain analytics, and explicit outcomes, while remaining open to complexity, disruption, and emergence.”</li>
<li>In <a href=""http://socialcapital.wordpress.com/2012/07/20/guest-post-want-to-bridge-disrupt"">“Want to Bridge? Disrupt!”</a>, a guest post I did for the Social Capital Blog of Harvard’s Saguaro Seminar, I focused on the importance of disruption for Fellows to forge authentic relationships across all kinds of difference.</li>
<li>In <a href=""http://www.ncrp.org/publications/responsive-pubs/rp-archive/responsive-philanthropy-summer-2012/first-relationships-then-results"">“First Relationships. Then Results.”</a>—a longer piece in the quarterly journal of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy—Stefan went deeper on the network theory and how a decision by Barr to focus on the Fellowship as a “connectivity” rather than “action” or “alignment” network enabled Barr to be more responsive than directive about the kinds of collaborations and collective action that emerged from the Fellows.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the most part, these have focused—and rightly so—on the ways the Fellowship has impacted Fellows themselves and on the unlikely and powerful collaborations that are beginning to emerge from their network. What has been less of a focus, however, is something that has proved incredibly vital to me and to Barr. Call it a happy accident or unintended consequence—this effort to celebrate, rejuvenate, and connect extraordinary social-change leaders has proved a remarkable gift back to us at Barr. It has enabled authentic relationships, honesty, openness, and real dialogue that I have never before experienced in all my years in philanthropy. This reflection recalled to mind for me an interview I did several years ago for <a href=""http://www.geofunders.org"">Grantmakers for Effective Organizations</a> as part of its <a href=""http://www.geofunders.org/news/videos"">Engage for Results</a> video series.</p>

75,The Little Cities that Could (and Did and Are...),<p>A new approach in greater Boston is showing early promise accelerating efforts to save money and reduce our carbon footprint.</p>,"<p>Without a national climate and energy policy, leadership on climate action has been coming from the states and especially from cities. The stories most often in the spotlight are of bigger cities like New York, San Francisco, Chicago, or Boston. But what about smaller cities and towns, where residents and municipal leaders are every bit as interested in saving money on their energy bills, reducing their carbon footprint, and doing their part to mitigate the risks of climate change?</p>

<p>In 2011, Barr made a grant focused on trying to coordinate and accelerate such efforts. The grantee was the <a href=""http://www.mapc.org/"">Metropolitan Area Planning Council</a> (MAPC), which is the regional planning agency serving the people who live and work in the 101 cities and towns of metro Boston. Where individual towns often lack the resources or skills to make large-scale changes on their own, MAPC’s Clean Energy Division coordinated efforts of over 60 different communities on energy planning and regional energy projects. It brought technical expertise and targeted staffing support, and it managed joint purchasing on behalf of participating communities. By aggregating demand, MAPC helped municipalities negotiate significant discounts on LED street lights and joint procurement of other efficiency measures.</p>

<p>To assess 1) how implementation was going and 2) how significant potential emissions savings really were, Barr commissioned an independent formative evaluation. The evaluator shared the first-year results with us and with MAPC in June, 2012. In short, she found that MAPC had identified significant potential energy savings and greenhouse gas reductions. The full evaluation is available here:</p>

74,Barr Announces Awards to 15 Boston Arts Organizations That Support Young People,<p>We are pleased to introduce a second cohort of Boston arts organizations to receive support from Barr and the Klarman Family Foundation under a new capacity-building grants program aimed at enhancing the artistic quality and long-term strength of organizations that support young people in achieving mastery in an art form.</p>,"<p>In 2011, following extensive conversations with local arts organizations about how they were responding to a challenging economy and the departure of several longtime, institutional funders of arts and culture in Boston, Barr introduced <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/arts-creativity"">a new strategy for its arts grantmaking</a>. This strategy is focused on two areas that the foundation has supported since its inception—mid-sized arts organizations and youth arts programs that help young people achieve mastery in an art form. The strategy provides for deeper, multi-faceted, longer-term support to cohorts of arts organizations. This focus on cohorts was a direct response to grantees, who noted that declining arts funding in Boston had resulted in fewer forums to share strategies, to learn together, and to coordinate collective action focused on drawing new funding to Boston arts organizations.</p>

<p>Barr issued its first open request for concept papers in the fall of 2011, for the mid-sized cohort, and in early 2012 <a href=""http://www.barrfoundation.org/news/barr-announces-awards-to-15-boston-arts-organizations-under-new-grant-progr"">a fifteen-member group of outstanding mid-sized organizations were chosen to receive awards</a>. This group has already begun convening, sharing strategies, and collaborating in new ways. Since I started at Barr in August, I’ve had the chance to join some of these conversations. I am excited to share more in the years ahead about what is emerging from this group and what we are learning together.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we are also delighted to introduce the newest cohort to receive funding under this new approach—fifteen organizations offering Boston youth from across the city rich opportunities to pursue excellence in a wide range of artistic disciplines:</p>

73,Massachusetts Named Most Energy Efficient State (Again),"<p>For the second year in a row, Massachusetts nabbed the number spot on a list ranking states by their energy efficiency initiatives. In this post, Senior Program Officer Mariella Puerto talks to Ian Bowles, former Secretary of Energy and Environment for Massachusetts, and Jeremy McDiarmid, Massachusetts Director at Environment Northeast, to find out what this designation means, how Massachusetts got it, and what it will take to keep the momentum going.</p>","<p>For the second year in a row, Massachusetts nabbed the number one spot on a list ranking states on energy efficiency. <a href=""http://aceee.org/research-report/e12c"">The State Energy Efficiency Scorecard</a> is compiled by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit. It rates the 50 states and District of Columbia on their implementation of policies and programs to encourage efficient use of energy across their economies. Other states that scored well include California, New York, Vermont, Connecticut, and Rhode Island.</p>

<p>I recently spoke with two leaders in the energy field to get their perspectives on this ranking - Ian Bowles, former Secretary of Energy and Environment for Massachusetts, and Jeremy McDiarmid, Massachusetts Director at <a href=""http://www.env-ne.org/"">Environment Northeast</a> (ENE), an environmental policy nonprofit organization.</p>

<hr>

<p>MARIELLA: What is the significance of this ranking?</p>

<p>IAN:  Under Governor Patrick, Massachusetts has taken a number one leadership position in many clean energy and climate priorities: energy efficiency, building codes, ocean planning, creative solar incentives, offshore wind, to name a few.  Of these, only energy efficiency has a very credible national scorecard. ACEEE has been smart in stoking the competition among states. What we are seeing now is the natural competitive juices flowing. Other states are looking to dislodge Massachusetts, and that is a great thing for energy efficiency.</p>

<p>JEREMY: I agree with Ian that it creates a race to the top among states.  It’s also a recognition of excellence for all of the folks who are doing the work - the engineers, contractors, utility planners, and others who are making our homes and workplaces more efficient and more comfortable.</p>

<p>MARIELLA: What do you think were the key ingredients to the state’s success? </p>

<p>JEREMY: It took support and leadership from Governor Patrick and the legislature. It took support from important constituents, ranging from consumers and representatives of both low-income residents and business. It took effective advocacy by sustainable energy experts. It also took a willingness by people concerned with different parts of this issue - energy costs, climate change, or our economic future – to actually listen to each other and work together.</p>

<p>IAN: Massachusetts has done well because we have partnered with the utilities, promoted competition among vendors, and created incentives and penalties tied to performance.  We live in a state literally at the end of the natural gas pipeline – so energy prices are higher here than in other parts of the U.S.  That makes people more open to energy efficiency.  We also have a lot of leading companies in energy efficiency here in Massachusetts – so public figures can see the jobs in it as well.</p>

<p>JEREMY:  When the Green Communities Act passed in 2008, it fundamentally changed the way we approach energy efficiency.  Instead of setting a cap on efficiency investments, we now treat efficiency as an energy resource, investing in all efficiency that is cheaper than other energy resources.  The Act created a stakeholder council that works collaboratively with utilities to improve efficiency efforts.  It also aligned the incentives of utilities in ways that reward excellent performance.</p>

<p>MARIELLA: What do we have to do to keep our number one ranking?</p>

<p>JEREMY: The number one ranking is a feather in our cap, but it is not a reason to rest or slow down.  Let’s keep in mind that this is a relative ranking against other states – it doesn’t mean Massachusetts has passed the finish line.  Many of our oldest buildings need improved energy treatments. And the energy efficiency measures we already know how to do still need to be deployed in many more homes and businesses.  The ACEEE recognition simply reflects that Massachusetts is doing the right things and is on is the right path. But we are only getting out of the starting gate.</p>

<p>IAN: I agree. We are maybe a third of the way to where we need to be on energy efficiency - sure, best in the nation. But many great challenges still lie ahead.  So, we need to keep pushing forward.  We need to maintain the strong commitment to energy efficiency we have in the business community. Having businesses see the savings and agitate to keep those savings coming is important.  And we have to counter the few remaining skeptics. Last year, some misinformed folks spoke about the costs of investing in energy efficiency ($2 billion) but somehow forgot to mention the benefits ($6 billion).  We need to reject that talk whenever it comes up.</p>

<p>MARIELLA: Both of you say we have a long way to go. Can you give some examples?</p>

<p>IAN: We have an older housing stock and if we want consumers to do much deeper energy retrofits (like heavy insulation and weather sealing, updating heating and cooling equipment, and lighting), we need a compelling value proposition for them. So I’d like to see energy efficiency sold more aggressively to every homeowner and then build a relationship with homeowners where they are given good choices to get more savings each year.</p>

<p>JEREMY: Yes, that’s right. For the sake of our economy and our environment, we need to continue to make sound investments in proven efficiency programs, test new technologies, and push for even greater gains. We need to get more energy savings from each building that gets efficiency treatments.  We need to find more ways to fund and finance energy efficiency.  We need to continually evaluate and incorporate new technologies like LED lights and web-based energy controls.  And we need to make sure everyone has access to top-notch efficiency programs, including consumers who are harder to reach and harder to serve, as well as consumers served by municipal utilities.</p>

<p>MARIELLA: Thank you both for making the time to talk to me today – and for all your efforts both behind the scenes and on the front lines of these efforts.</p>

<p>IAN: My pleasure.</p>

<p>JEREMY: Me too. It’s an exciting time to be doing this work.</p>"

71,"Networks, Fun, and Healthy Competition Spur Boston Businesses on Sustainability","<p>In Boston and most cities, the majority of GHG emissions come from buildings (in Boston, they are responsible for 74% of the city's carbon footprint).</p>","<p>In Boston and most cities, the majority of GHG emissions come from buildings (in Boston, they are responsible for 74% of the city’s carbon footprint). This means that, without the support and participation of businesses that own and manage buildings, there is little hope of Boston or any city hitting the kind of GHG reduction targets necessary to curb climate change. What can be done? A new program in Boston is showing the power of peer networks, fun, and healthy competition to do right by the environment and their companies’ bottom lines.</p>

<p>In 2010, with support from the Barr Foundation, <a href=""http://abettercity.org/"">A Better City</a> (ABC), a Boston-area business association, launched its <a href=""http://abettercity.org/environment/challenge.html"">Challenge For Sustainability</a>. Its aim was to provide a simple, but comprehensive system for tracking sustainability actions and impacts, and also to create a network for sharing ideas and effective practices (and to generate healthy competition).</p>

<p>Earlier this year, an independent evaluation documented the successes, challenges, and impacts of the effort in its first full year.  In 2011, 37 properties representing 15.4 million square feet participated in the Challenge. Collectively they saved 8.5 million kWh of electricity (enough to power 1,700 homes for a year) and 11 million gallons of water (enough to fill 2,100 Olympic size swimming pools).</p>

<p>How did ABC get this to happen?</p>

<p>One important ingredient turned out to be engaging businesses in the fun of friendly competition with their peers.  The tools and resources ABC provided to Challenge Participants - including a scorecard, toolkits, and dedicated ABC staff – created the knowledge and pathways for change. Yet participants consistently noted that the peer network and competition is what made the Challenge fun and helped build engagement and commitment.</p>

<p>The Challenge has allowed businesses to engage at levels they find comfortable and that are tailored to their unique business environments and priorities.  Many participants are finding increasing ways to deepen their level of implementation, resulting in a positive reinforcing loop of increased personal and company-wide commitment to sustainability. Collectively, these companies are building a network of business leaders committed to sustainability across Boston.</p>

<p>The full evaluation is attached to the bottom of this post.</p>

<p>ABC has also been producing short videos featuring participants, their work, and its impacts. Here are two of the first - &quot;Build it, They will Fill it&quot; and &quot;Small Business, Big Rewards&quot;:</p>

70,Lessons from a New Effort to Scale Energy Efficiency in Boston,"<p>One of the most difficult groups to engage in energy efficiency is low- and moderate-income families. Into this gap steps Renew Boston, a one-stop shop to help Boston residents and businesses get into the energy-saving game at no cost.</p>","<p>Massachusetts leads the nation in energy efficiency (see <a href=""https://www.mass.gov/news/massachusetts-named-most-energy-efficient-state"">&quot;Massachusetts Named Most Energy Efficient State (Again)&quot;)</a> because its per-capita spending on energy efficiency is higher than any other state.</p>

<p>With some of the oldest housing stock in the country this is money well spent. The potential for reducing energy use (and associated emissions) saving money and creating new jobs is all significant. </p>

<p>Indeed many are already seeing these kinds of benefits. Yet many are not. For various reasons one of the most difficult groups to engage in this work is low- and moderate-income families – even though their participation is critical if Boston and Massachusetts are to hit their aggressive targets for reducing emissions. </p>

<p>This is why Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino established <a href=""http://www.renewboston.org"">Renew Boston</a> which was conceived as a one-stop shop to help Boston residents and businesses get into the energy-saving game at no cost. Working with its partners <a href=""http://www.nstar.com/about_nstar/"">NSTAR</a>, <a href=""https://www1.nationalgridus.com/Massachusetts-MA-RES?ng=us"">National Grid</a>, and <a href=""http://www.masssave.com/"">MassSave</a>, Renew Boston coordinates energy assessments it helps identify rebate and incentive programs and it also helps coordinate implementation of actual energy efficiency improvements.  </p>

<p>Between August 2010 and April 2012 Renew Boston conducted energy assessments in 6500 income-eligible households (60%-120% of the state median income) – in addition to its work with city businesses. Roughly half of those receiving energy assessments implemented some or all of the recommendations using utility rebates and federal stimulus funds to pay for the upgrades. </p>

<p>To get a better understanding of what worked and what didn&#39;t Barr commissioned the Cambridge-based Goodman Research Group to conduct an independent assessment. Their full report is available for download below but here are some of their key findings about progress at the end of the evaluation period in April 2012 (and we know even more households received weatherization benefits by the time the last job that used federal stimulus funds was completed in August 2012):  </p>

<ul>
<li>33% of participants in the data set implemented all of the recommendations from their home energy assessment<br></li>
<li>An additional 18% implemented at least some of the recommendations<br></li>
<li><strong>Energy efficiency must be &quot;sold&quot;</strong>: Appeals to environmental values or information about the availability of inexpensive loans are not sufficient. Direct rebates and clear savings are needed.<br></li>
<li><strong>Customer service matters</strong>: Online retailers like Amazon and Zappos have figured out how to engage customers in dynamic ways through recommendations customer reviews and a high quality customer service experience. While projects like home insulation are always going to be more complicated than most online purchases, there are still many opportunities to make it easier and convenient for consumers to get a great retrofit, and to have an experience that is so positive they want to tell friends, family, neighbors, and colleagues about it.<br></li>
<li><strong>Multi-family units remain a challenge</strong>: Condos and apartment buildings present unique challenges and require specialized approaches.<br></li>
<li><strong>Community and neighbor mobilization is essential</strong>: Trusted nonprofits and other community-based organizations can play a vital role getting everyone into the energy-saving game.<br></li>
<li><strong>&quot;Pre-weatherization&quot; issues can be a deal breaker</strong>: Sometimes things like ventilation problems or antiquated wiring can be an impasse. Without supports for such &quot;pre-weatherization&quot; issues, many low- and moderate-income families will fall through the cracks of efficiency programs.</li>

69,Doors Open,"<p>""Doors Open"" is a new short film featuring three schools that opened their doors for the very first time in Boston this fall. Each school is a compelling story—of vision, mission, and bright hopes for kids. Looked at together in this film, they are also part of an even bigger story about breakthroughs in old debates about public education.</p>","<p>When I was growing up, I always loved the first day of school. A crisp new dress. Sharpened pencils in my backpack. Even in my Southern California farm town, there was a slight September chill in the air. It all filled me with anticipatory joy.</p>

<p>I felt the same way this fall when the doors opened for the very first time at three new public schools in Boston: the <a href=""http://munizacademy.org"">Margarita Muñiz Academy</a>, the city’s first two-way bilingual Spanish-English High School; the <a href=""http://www.dudleystreetschool.org"">Dudley Street Neighborhood Charter School</a>, a partnership between a great neighborhood organization and a teacher-training program modeled after medical residencies in teaching hospitals; and <a href=""http://kippma.org/schools/kipp-academy-boston"">KIPP Academy Boston</a>, a middle school launched by a national network of high-performing charter schools.</p>

<p>On their own each of these new schools offers a compelling story—of vision, mission, and bright hopes for kids. Yet, looked at together, they are also part of an even bigger story about breakthroughs in old debates about public education. These schools were all made possible by new education legislation passed in 2010. “An Act Relative to the Achievement Gap” gave Massachusetts districts like Boston new tools for helping struggling schools, and also for expanding their portfolio of choices with new, innovative schools, like Muñiz, Dudley, and KIPP Boston. Since the 2010 act was passed, Barr has dedicated a portion of its education funding to helping schools like these get off to a strong start.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/284/small.png?1642116358 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/284/medium.png?1642116358 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/284/large.png?1642116358 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/284/x_large.png?1642116358 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""Doors Open - Muniz"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/284/small.png?1642116358"" /> </div> </div> </p>

<p>These schools also exemplify a new conversation underway in Boston—one that is flipping the script on the historically chilly relationship between charter and traditional district schools. As Boston’s historic “District-Charter Compact” makes plain (see <a href=""http://www.cityofboston.gov/news/Default.aspx?id=5087"">“Mayor Menino, BPS and Charter Schools Present Boston&#39;s First District Charter Compact”</a> or <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/come-together-right-now"">“Come Together Right Now”</a>), there is a new openness by Boston Public Schools to collaborate in meaningful ways with a wide variety of school operators, including charter and parochial schools.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/285/small.png?1642116365 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/285/medium.png?1642116365 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/285/large.png?1642116365 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/285/x_large.png?1642116365 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""Doors Open - KIPP"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/285/small.png?1642116365"" /> </div> </div> </p>

<p>Watching the Muñiz Academy, Dudley Street Neighborhood Charter School, and KIPP Academy Boston come to life over the past year—setting up classrooms, recruiting families, planning lessons, and more—has been inspiring and informing on many levels. To capture the energy, excitement, and magic of their <em>very first</em> first days and a view of that bigger story as it continues to unfold, we engaged a documentary film maker, (<a href=""http://www.unrenderedfilms.com"">Unrendered Films</a>), to produce a short film.</p>

<p>The result is <em>Doors Open</em>, an eleven-minute glimpse of the hope and possibility that we want all of our children to feel on their first day of school.</p>

67,The Invisible Elephant in the Room: Gas Leaks and Climate,"<p>Two recent reports shine a spotlight on an until-recently unaccounted for source of GHG emissions – methane that leaks from old and leaky pipes that, by the authors' estimates, mean the state is losing more ground than it's gaining.</p>","<p><em>This entry originally appeared on the (members-only) blog of the <a href=""http://ega.org/"">Environmental Grantmakers Association</a> at: <a href=""http://ega.org/blog/invisible-elephant-room-gas-leaks-and-climate"">http://ega.org/blog/invisible-elephant-room-gas-leaks-and-climate</a>.</em>  </p>

<p>Nearly two years ago, I started hearing about a professor doing research like I had never heard of anyone doing on greenhouse gas emissions. Professor Nathan Philips teaches in the <a href=""http://www.bu.edu/earth/"">Earth and Environment Department</a> at Boston University (BU). He had put sensors on the roof of his office building to measure what he calls Boston&#39;s &quot;urban metabolism.&quot; This is the ebbs and flows of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and methane in a city&#39;s atmosphere. Phillips had also driven nearly every street in Boston with a methane sensor in his trunk, taking readings of gas that leaks from natural gas pipelines that run under our streets. </p>

<p>I had read that methane is over 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide in terms of climate impacts (see the <a href=""http://epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/gases/ch4.html"">EPA&#39;s analysis</a> for more on this). But I couldn&#39;t find any good information on how big a problem this actually was. Meanwhile advances in hydraulic fracking were triggering huge increase in our reliance on natural gas – which was being aggressively touted as a &quot;clean energy&quot; breakthrough. </p>

<p>I called Professor Phillips and asked for a meeting. What I wanted to know was: how big was this problem? And why was no one was talking about it? </p>

<p>That initial conversation led to others and, in mid-2012, Barr provided support to Boston University and to the <a href=""http://www.clf.org/"">Conservation Law Foundation</a> (CLF) to investigate the extent of natural gas leakage in Boston and Massachusetts and to explore potential policy solutions. </p>

<p>Both BU and CLF produced reports on their work at the end of November. Some of the major findings are below though the most surprising and alarming takeaway is evident in this <a href=""http://www.clf.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/InfographicHorizontal.print_.2.jpg"">infographic</a> – we may be losing more ground than we&#39;re gaining.    </p>

<p>Major Findings from the BU and CLF reports include:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Natural gas is escaping from more than 3300 leaks in Boston.<br></li>
<li>Most leaks are tiny - although six had gas levels higher than the threshold at which explosions can occur.<br></li>
<li>In 2010 Massachusetts saved 1097 million cubic feet of natural gas through energy efficiency programs. But in the same time period, Massachusetts lost more gas through leaks than it saved.<br></li>
<li>The costs of these leaks – about $38.8 million a year – are passed on to gas customers in Massachusetts.<br></li>
<li>Current state and federal policies provide disincentives for pipeline owners to find and fix leaks unless they are considered hazardous.<br></li>
<li>Building new transmission lines and new gas generation would be costly. Reducing leaks and increasing the efficiency of the existing infrastructure (including gas storage) could provide a more cost-effective, environmentally beneficial means of meeting energy needs.<br></li>
<li>There are a number of policy solutions that can be pursued cost-effectively and expeditiously, solutions that are outlined in CLF&#39;s report.<br></li>
<li>Almost one-third of the natural gas pipelines in Massachusetts are made of cast iron or unprotected steel, materials that are highly prone to leaks. Fifty percent of the cast iron pipelines in the U.S. are concentrated in Massachusetts and only three other states: New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, where this issue deserves a much closer look as well.<br></li>

<p>In a <a href=""http://www.analysisgroup.com/article.aspx?id=13930"">related report issued by the Analysis Group</a>, Paul Hibbard – former Chair of the Massachusetts DPU – and Craig Aubuchon describe a benefit-cost model they used to quantify the benefits of reducing gas leaks through expanded utility pipe replacement programs. Reducing leaks generates economic benefits by (1) reducing the amount of gas that utilities buy and charge ratepayers for, and (2) reducing the social impact of higher greenhouse gas emissions. The authors quantify significant benefits under a wide range of assumptions, and compare them to the cost of utility pipe replacement programs.</p>"
66,"Finding the ""just"" in climate change","<p>In all of its work, Barr is guided by a vision for a vibrant, just, and sustainable world, with hopeful futures for children. In Barr's climate change portfolio, the applications of ""vibrant"" and ""sustainable"" are clear—but articulating how this work is also about creating a more ""just"" world can be more elusive.</p>","<p>Our best effort thus far has been to express it this way in our <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/climate"">Climate strategy</a>: <em>&quot;We also seek to support approaches that ensure no group of residents is unfairly burdened by the costs of action, or excluded from the benefits to pocketbook, health, or quality of life that flow from new energy efficiency and clean energy jobs, more efficient buildings, and a highly efficient transportation network.&quot;</em></p>

<p>To shed some light and to guide us into a deeper conversation on this topic, in January I invited <a href=""http://www.law.berkeley.edu/php-programs/faculty/facultyProfile.php?facID=15781"">dr. john a powell</a> to speak with Barr grantees, staff, and other Boston colleagues. dr. powell holds the Robert D. Haas Chancellor&#39;s Chair in Equity and Inclusion at Berkeley School of Law and is the author most recently of <em>Racing to Justice</em>, a collection of essays. </p>

<p>What resulted was a fascinating conversation and a challenge to all of us to move beyond thinking about racism as an issue of individual bias or bigotry and instead to see what the challenges really are—the structures and systems that create outcomes with clear racial patterns. </p>

<p>Just as I sat down to begin writing some reflections from the day something better happened—an email landed in my inbox from Beth Tener, a consultant who has worked with us and several of our grantees. It included a link to her new entry on the <a href=""http://www.ndcollaborative.com/blog"">New Directions Collaborative blog</a>. I found it to be a terrific synthesis.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s Beth&#39;s take on the challenge:</p>

<p><em>&quot;We all live within structures that provide opportunities e.g. the opportunity to access education, health care, food, transportation, communications, etc. These structures unevenly distribute benefits and burdens to different groups. Seen another way, individuals are situated in the systems differently. For example, an African American youth in Roxbury MA is geographically segregated from educational and job opportunities compared to a wealthier white youth that lives close to downtown and public transportation. In another example, <a href=""http://www.northeastern.edu/dukakiscenter/stayingontrack"">a report by the Dukakis Center</a> found that in Boston black commuters spend an extra 66 hours a year waiting, riding, and transferring than white bus riders.&quot;</em></p>

<p>And here&#39;s how she captured powell&#39;s idea for what we can do about the challenge:</p>

<p><em>powell advocates an approach of &quot;targeted universalism&quot; – create a universal goal, then recognize how groups are situated differently within structures related to the goal, and develop targeted programs or approaches based on these situations.</em></p>

<p>For one example of the difference between universal and targeted solutions, see <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/talking-ells-in-bps"">&quot;Talking ELL&#39;s in BPS&quot;</a>. This is based on remarks by Pat Brandes at the 2011 <a href=""http://www.effectivephilanthropy.org"">Center for Effective Philanthropy</a> conference. She describes what it took, and what difference it made, when the Boston Public Schools—under a universal goal of improving achievement for all students—took a targeted approach to a specific group of students, in this case, English Language Learners.</p>

<p>And one resource... </p>

<p>In 2007, Barr invited a team from the Applied Research Center and the Philanthropic Initiative for Racial Equity to take a close look at our work, and to help us understand 1) the degree to which our efforts generated outcomes that were racially just; and 2) opportunities to improve. The <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/barr-foundation-racial-justice-analysis"">executive summary and final presentation</a> are available. Both open with a helpful primer on the history of how we got the structures and systems in this country that now generate outcomes that consistently differ by race.</p>"

Learn more about this unique program dedicated to identifying, recruiting, and cultivating emerging practitioners of color who represent the next generation of leaders in philanthropy.</p>","<p>When people ask me how I found my way into a career in philanthropy, I always say I fell into it after serving as an Allocations Volunteer at the <a href=""http://supportunitedway.org"">United Way</a>. That time as a volunteer opened my eyes to an entirely different way to apply my skill set—I was working then as a commercial bank auditor—and to a career well suited to my personal interests and values. And so it has been a real privilege for me to be able to pay forward the same kind of opportunity-making and door-opening through something called the <a href=""http://www.proteusfund.org/special-projects/diversity-fellowship"">Proteus Diversity Fellowship</a>.</p>

<p>Incubated and launched at <a href=""http://www.agmconnect.org"">Associated Grant Makers</a> in Boston in 2006, the Diversity Fellowship is now housed at the Proteus Fund in western Massachusetts. Its mission is to identify, recruit, and cultivate emerging practitioners of color who represent the next generation of philanthropic leaders. As Pat Brandes, Barr’s executive director, noted in a <a href=""http://philanthropy.texterity.com/philanthropy/20120504?pg=22#pg22"">May 2012 <em>Chronicle of Philanthropy</em> article</a> spotlighting the fellowship, “If you go to a philanthropy conference today you can see that we still don’t have the level of diversity that we should have. We have to get very concrete about ways to create a pipeline for philanthropy.” The Proteus Diversity Fellowship is precisely this kind of pipeline.</p>

<p>Diversity Fellows spend a year as staff members at different foundations, working on major projects. As a group, they also receive extensive professional development and networking opportunities.</p>

<p>Barr has been a supporter of the Fellowship since its inception. And I have had the chance to supervise three different fellows, including our amazing director of operations, Ify Mora, who was a Diversity Fellow in 2009–2010.</p>

60,"Active, Healthy, Ready to Learn (and Fighting Climate Change) with Safe Routes to School","<p>In 1969, about half of all American children walked or biked to school. Of those living within a mile from school, 87% walked or biked. Today, less than 15% do.</p>","<p>In its <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/climate"">climate work</a>, Barr is committed to helping Boston and Massachusetts meet or exceed their targets for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and become national models for reducing GHG emissions. To do this, we focus on two of the largest emissions sources: buildings and transportation. I oversee Barr’s investments related to transportation. When people ask me what this means, I say that it is about making it easier for people to get out of their cars. This is easier said than done in a country where we love our cars so much, and where we’ve grown and developed in ways that have left many dependent on cars for almost all their transportation needs.</p>

<p>But it turns out there are many ways, big and small, to help places and communities become places where getting into a car is, less and less, the only way, or even the preferred way to get around. One such effort I’ve been thrilled to support is <a href=""http://www.walkboston.org/what-we-do/initiatives/safe-routes-school"">WalkBoston’s Safe Routes to School Program</a>.</p>

<p>In 1969, about half of all American children walked or biked to school. Of those who lived within a mile from school, 87% of children walked or biked. Today, less than 15% do. This has enormous implications not only for reducing vehicle emissions and morning gridlock, but also for children’s health and readiness to learn. WalkBoston has been working on this issue since 2001, when it piloted a first Safe Routes to School Program in Arlington, a Boston suburb. This program was so successful that it spread to other communities in Metro Boston. Meanwhile Safe Routes to School has become a national and even international movement – with many states and localities trying to figure out how and where to implement these approaches.</p>

<p>One of the first grants I recommended after Barr set its climate strategy in 2010 was to WalkBoston. Part of their proposal was to design an analytical framework that could help states identify communities with the highest potential for changing travel patterns of students who live close to schools. When WalkBoston applied this new tool to Metro Boston, the communities that rose to the top were Lawrence, Malden, and Revere.</p>

<p>Historically, Safe Routes to Schools has found ardent supporters in the environment and health communities, but less so among educators. That dynamic is changing, however, thanks to WalkBoston, and to Safe Routes to Schools champions like Ann Marie, former Deputy Superintendent in Revere, Massachusetts, who is featured in a great new short film called, “Revere Walks.” Check it out…</p>

59,A New Paradigm for Leadership Development,"<p>What if, instead of barreling ahead, relentlessly focused on keeping their organizations afloat (until they burn out trying), effective nonprofit leaders started delegating more and more responsibility to staff—at once paving the way for a next generation of leaders and freeing themselves to think about their own leadership in more expansive ways?</p>","<p>What would it take to effect such a shift? And what would emerge if, at the same time, a critical mass of these great leaders become a great network?</p>

<p>Since 2005, when the first group of 12 leaders of Boston nonprofits were surprised by a phone call from the Barr Foundation, inviting them to join a network called the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/fellows"">Barr Fellowship</a>, we have had the chance to discover and be inspired by the answers to these questions. There are now 48 Barr Fellows, and their stories of personal, organizational, and city transformation have been getting attention—in the <a href=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/25/attachments/Networking_a_City_(Stanford_Social_Innovation_Review).pdf?1421961527"">“Networking a City”</a> <em>Stanford Social Innovation Review</em> case study, in The Boston Globe, and <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/an-unintended-consequence-of-authentic-relationships/"">elsewhere</a>, including a new article in <em>The Foundation Review</em> called <a href=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/27/attachments/Only_Connect_-_Foundation_Review__Vol_5_No_1__2013.pdf?1421961591"">“Only Connect: Investing in Relationships,”</a> which I developed with Pat Brandes, Barr&#39;s executive director, and Claire Reinelt, our Fellowship evaluator.</p>

<p>And while each of these accounts has been colored by quotes and profiles of the Fellows, there is nothing like hearing them speak in their own words. That’s why, earlier this year, we teamed up with Hairpin Communications to develop three short films, each featuring six Fellows talking about their experiences.</p>

<p>Last week, my colleague Kim Haskins, who manages the Fellowship, and I had the chance to preview these films as part of a webinar for the Leadership Learning Community. You can see the slides and listen to the recording <a href=""http://bit.ly/16TVZCp"">on this site</a>. But these new films you can see right here…</p>

58,"Getting to ""Whole Child Time""",<p>What would it take to move beyond a school- and classroom-bound view of where learning and youth development actually happens – to explore more holistic approaches?</p>,"<p>Last March, I was invited to speak on a panel at the “Learning, It’s Personal!” conference, co-hosted by the <a href=""http://www.pearweb.org/"">Program on Education, Afterschool, and Resiliency</a> and <a href=""http://bostonbeyond.org/"">Boston after School and Beyond</a>. The conference focused on organizations partnering to advance and integrate the fields of education, youth development and mental health. Attendees and speakers were drawn by the idea of moving beyond a school- and classroom-bound view of where learning and youth development actually happens – to explore more holistic approaches. One example that got a lot of attention was what’s been happening in Boston with summer learning (see <a href=""http://bostonbeyond.org/summer-learning/"">Boston Summer Learning Project</a>) – a promising model I plan to write more about soon.</p>

<p>For my panel, I was asked to reflect on what the “game changers” were to affect the critical shifts in mindset and approach. I spoke about five:</p>

<ol>
<li>The importance of focusing not only academic achievement gaps, but more broadly on opportunity gaps</li>
<li>Seeing all time as “whole child time” – not just focusing on in-school time as learning time</li>
<li>Being clearer about the essential skills we want youth to cultivate</li>
<li>Expanding our frame for what the critical data is</li>
<li>Partnering in radically different ways</li>

57,Some Things Inspiring in the State of Denmark,"<p>Copenhagen is on track to become the world's first carbon neutral capital by 2025 – even while attracting 100,000 new residents. In June, Mariella Puerto, Barr Senior Program Officer, joined a group of US-based foundation staff to see firsthand how they were doing it.</p>","<p>In June, thanks to the <a href=""http://www.boell.de/en"">Heinrich Böll Foundation</a>, I had the chance to join a study tour to Denmark and Germany with staff from several US-based foundations that, like Barr, are working to accelerate our transition to a clean energy economy. Our first stop was Copenhagen.</p>

<p>In many ways, Copenhagen reminded me of Boston. It is a waterfront city with old buildings and meandering streets. But it is also experiencing a boom in new, waterfront real estate (much like Boston’s Seaport Innovation District).</p>

<p>When it comes to climate plans, Copenhagen leads the pack on ambition. In fall 2012, Copenhagen rolled out a plan to become the world&#39;s first “carbon neutral” capital by 2025. It had a solid foundation to build on, having reduced its emissions by 21 percent between 2005 and 2011.</p>

<p>How did the Danes do it? Here are a few things I learned...</p>
<h2>The Bike is King</h2>
<p>The Copenhagen cityscape is full of bicycles and bicyclists of every age and type: women in dresses and heels, men in suits, old couples in matching tracksuits, parents towing kids in cargo bikes, and shoppers carting groceries. At one point, I even saw a whole wedding party cycle by. Copenhagen city planners have made access for bicycles in public spaces a priority. It has a well-designed network of “cycle tracks,” which are bikeways separated and protected from traffic by physical barriers, like curbs – as opposed to bike lanes common in US cities that are demarcated only by a line of paint on pavement. Cycle tracks have their own traffic lights and often turn green first. What about snow in winter? No problem. City policy mandates that snow be removed from cycle tracks before car lanes. As the quickest, easiest, cheapest, and (we tried it ourselves, so I can say firsthand) fun way to get around town, it is not surprising that biking is the preferred mode of transportation in Copenhagen. 52% of all Copenhageners cycle to work or school every day. In fact, more people commute by bicycle in greater Copenhagen than in the entire United States. To entice suburban commuters to hop on their bikes, Copenhagen is partnering with neighboring cities to build what they call cycle superhighways. These are wider, contiguously linked tracks with amenities like bike pumps. The first one was completed in 2012. With strategies like these, by 2025, Copenhagen expects 75 percent of trips to be made by foot, bike, or public transit. </p>

<h2>All in with wind</h2>
<p>Bikes are not the only ubiquitous feature in Copenhagen. So are wind turbines a few miles offshore. The turbines closest to the city are part of the Middelgrunden wind farm – 20 turbines with a capacity of 40 Megawatts which covers 3% of the energy in Copenhagen. This wind farm is cooperatively owned by the municipal utility company and 8,500 community members, who share in the profits – a structure that greatly facilitated public support for wind energy.</p>

<p>Denmark’s embrace of wind energy was influenced by the oil crisis in the 1970s and Chernobyl in 1986. Determined to wean off fossil fuels, and recognizing the business opportunity of wind energy, Denmark launched a major transformation from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. Along the way, it became a pioneer in commercial wind power. Today, wind power makes up approximately 30% of Denmark’s electric sector and almost half of all wind turbines around the world are produced by Danish manufacturers, such as Vestas and Siemens. Copenhagen plans to build 100 more wind turbines by 2025. This is a major component of its decarbonization strategy.</p>
<h2>Keeping it Warm and Cool Together (and while we’re at it, skiing)</h2>
<p>Less visible but just as important for emissions reduction is Copenhagen’s subterranean district heating system, which distributes heat through a pipe system to 98% of buildings in the city. The heat is generated by regional refuse incineration plants and combined heat and power plants. District energy is more efficient than decentralized, individual heating systems. City officials recognize that the current system is due for an upgrade to reduce pollutants and allow for renewable sources. A new plant is also under construction (and will – believe it or not – double as a ski slope).</p>

<p>Under the climate plan, district heating is to be carbon neutral by 2025. To complement district heating, there is also a state-of-the-art district cooling system, where waters from the city harbor are deployed to cool commercial buildings and data centers.</p>
<h2>Carbon-negative (!!!) new developments, walkability, and multi-modal growth</h2>
<p>Copenhagen is anticipating adding 100,000 new residents by 2025 while at the same time going carbon neutral. One piece of how this is possible is a new neighborhood on the waterfront, called Nordhavnen, which will accommodate 40,000 inhabitants and 40,000 workplaces, with the goal of making it a carbon-negative city district. This means the district will produce more energy than it consumes.</p>

<p>City planners are also applying the “Five minute city”- principle, ensuring that every point of the district can be reached within a five minute walk from a metro station. Moreover, bicycle riding will be promoted by high-speed direct lanes and with the patchwork of connecting canals, residents may also get around by small boat, canoe and kayak.</p>

<p>Copenhagen was an eye-opening and inspiring beginning to our trip.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for reflections on our next stop – Germany, where we got a firsthand look at the “Energiewende” (Germany’s “Energy Transition”).</p>"
56,Training and Connecting the Next Generation of Nonprofit Leaders,"<p>Barr supports organizations with strong track records of developing new and diverse leadership, like the Institute for Nonprofit Management and Leadership, which is now accepting applications for the 2013–2014 academic year.</p>","<p>Underpinning Barr’s efforts in its major focus areas is a commitment to a racially just and caring community with robust civic engagement. To support this vision of community, the Foundation provides support for organizations with strong track records of developing new and diverse leadership. <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/a-leadership-pipeline-for-philanthropy/"">I wrote about one of these last March</a>—the Proteus Diversity Fellowship, which is focused on philanthropy. Another program, focused on the broader nonprofit sector, is the <a href=""https://www.inml.org"">Institute for Nonprofit Management and Leadership</a> (INML), which is housed at the Boston University School of Management.</p>

<p>For more than 30 years, BU has offered the Public and Nonprofit Management Program for MBA candidates seeking to apply their management training to the social sector. In 2007, it launched INML with a mission to educate, support, and connect the next generation of nonprofit leaders. In that first year, INML enrolled 14 diverse professionals from Boston-based nonprofit organizations in its part-time certificate program designed to enhance their leadership in the sector. In 2008, to help INML build on the success of its first year, Barr provided a first grant to enroll 100 new candidates in the program over the next two years.</p>

<p>INML now offers two programs. The seven-month <a href=""https://www.inml.org/core-certificate-program.html"">Core Program</a> is designed for working executives and senior and middle managers who want to strengthen their foundational skills, build confidence, and join a rapidly growing network of nonprofit leaders. Graduates of the program receive a Certificate in Nonprofit Management and Leadership from Boston University. The new <a href=""https://www.inml.org/community-fellows-program.html"">Community Fellows Program</a>, also a certificate program, targets young, urban leaders who have already demonstrated leadership potential. This two-year program marries the Core Program’s focus on organizational leadership with community leadership.</p>

<p>Even as the program has grown, INML has maintained a commitment to increasing diversity of nonprofit leaders. Approximately 60% of the INML faculty are of color. And during INML’s first six years of operating, 43% of its graduates are people of color.</p>

<p>Although still relatively new, the INML has been celebrated broadly. In 2012, for example, it was awarded The Boston Foundation’s <a href=""http://www.tbf.org/news-and-events/news/2012/february/boston-foundation-recognizes-institute-for-nonprofit-management-and-leadership-with-100000-grant"">Out of the Blue Grant</a> for outstanding program quality and leadership in the nonprofit sector.</p>

<p><em>Please note that applications for the Core Program are due July 1, 2013.</em></p>"
55,Talk/Read/Succeed – Inspiration and Ideas from Springfield,"<p>With an ambitious, citywide goal, what’s the right scale to get started? What target population is small enough that results are achievable and the impacts tangible? In Springfield, Massachusetts, it looks like the answer is 180 families.</p>","<p>Recently I had the chance to visit Springfield, Massachusetts to see firsthand some of the inspiring work unleashed by the city’s <a href=""http://www.readby4thgrade.com"">“Reading Success by 4th Grade”</a> campaign. This campaign started when only thirty-six percent of Springfield third-graders scored proficient or better in reading on the 2009 Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System.</p>

<p>In response, the <a href=""http://www.davisfdn.org"">Irene E. &amp; George A. Davis Foundation</a> launched a year-long community engagement and research process that produced a blueprint for citywide, collective action. The goal of the campaign is that, by 2016, eighty percent of Springfield’s children will be proficient or better readers by the end of third grade. This is an important goal, as children learn to read through the third grade, but must read to learn in later years. Struggling readers are significantly more at risk of dropping out of school.</p>

<p>Third-grade reading proficiency rates in Boston are similar to those in Springfield—in 2012, only thirty-four percent of Boston third-graders scored proficient or advanced. So I was thrilled to have an opportunity to learn about Springfield’s work. Traveling with me to Springfield were several colleagues interested in early language and healthy child development: Wendy Puriefoy, Barr’s director of education; Shanna Shulman of the Smith Family Foundation; Corey Zimmerman of United Way of Massachusetts Bay &amp; Merrimack Valley; and Dinah Shepherd of Roxbury Preparatory Charter School.</p>

<p>Our host and guide was Sally Fuller, project director for “Reading Success by 4th Grade” at the Davis Foundation. Our itinerary focused on <a href=""http://www.readby4thgrade.com/programs/talk-read-succeed"">Talk/Read/Succeed</a>, an early literacy program working with 180 families at two Springfield Housing Authority developments to support children’s literacy and learning.</p>

<p>Our first stop was the John J. Sullivan Apartments, where we met in a beautiful, onsite Head Start classroom—one that, due to sequestration, was already closed for the year. We had a great, in-depth conversation with Talk/Read/Succeed staff and a participating parent about the program’s focus on four priorities: parent engagement, parent education, child education, and family self-sufficiency. I was struck by their process of periodically surveying families during one-on-one home visits, and by how the simple act of asking families what they want and need—and responding to those needs—helps them to get more engaged. This was later underscored for us by Rhonda Stowell Lewis, principal at Dorman Elementary School. Lewis pointed out that Talk/Read/Succeed families continued to be engaged parents once their children entered elementary school. She also noted that since Talk/Read/Succeed had launched, suspensions had steadily decreased, from sixty-four in 2011 to only eleven in 2013.</p>

<p>Our next stop was Boland Elementary School, where we spoke with a group of almost thirty people engaged in Talk/Read/Succeed and the “Reading Success by 4th Grade” campaign—ranging from the housing authority to the regional employment board, from the education association to the library.</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/279/small.jpg?1642116351 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/279/medium.jpg?1642116351 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/279/large.jpg?1642116351 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/279/x_large.jpg?1642116351 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""Talk/Read/Succeed staff at a parent empowerment conference"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/279/small.jpg?1642116351"" /> <div class=""FancyAttribution""> <p>Davis Foundation</p> </div> </div> </div> </p>

<p>In different ways, each expressed the shared goal of engaging parents as partners. It was clear that all of the programs had put the 180 families participating in Talk/Read/Succeed at the center of the equation, allowing family input and needs to inform and change their practices. The change in thinking and behavior across a wide spectrum of city agencies and community organizations was palpable.</p>

<p>After our visit I kept thinking about this change and how it connected to Springfield’s initial decision to focus on just 180 families in two housing developments. While that may seem like a small number compared to the city as a whole, it is actually a just-right number. It is small enough for results to be achievable and to make real differences in the lives of participating families. At the same time, because of all the different agencies and organizations that intersect at these two housing developments, that number is just big enough to change how a whole system of supports interacts with families citywide.</p>

<p>This was a big takeaway for me for our work in Boston.</p>"
54,Energievergnügen – the joy of (renewable) energy,"<p>Between 2010 and 2011, committed to building on three decades of solid progress on renewable energy and unnerved by Fukushima, the German parliament enacted a series of polices to shift its power sector away from fossil fuels and nuclear to 80% renewables by 2050.</p>","<p>In June, thanks to the <a href=""http://www.boell.de/en"">Heinrich Böll Foundation</a>, I had the chance to join a study tour to Denmark and Germany with staff from several US-based foundations that, like Barr, are working to accelerate our transition to a clean energy economy. <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/some-things-inspiring-in-the-state-of-denmark/"">In my last post, I wrote about Copenhagen</a>, its bike culture, its commitment to wind power, and other ideas driving progress towards that city’s goal to be the world&#39;s first “carbon neutral” capital by 2025.</p>

<p>After Copenhagen, our next stop was Germany, where we crisscrossed the country, meeting with politicians, farmers, community activists, small business owners, and many others to see how they were all engaged in the <a href=""http://energytransition.de/"">“Energiewende”</a> – Germany’s energy transition.  Between 2010 and 2011, committed to building on three decades of solid progress on renewable energy and unnerved by Fukushima, the German parliament enacted a series of polices to shift its power sector away from fossil fuels and nuclear to 80% renewables by 2050.</p>

<p>Two years later, they are well on their way. 25 percent of Germany’s electric power comes from solar, wind, and biomass. For comparison, in New England, 6.8% percent of our energy comes from renewable sources.  Germany leads the world in installed solar capacity, even though it gets less sun than anywhere in the US, except maybe Alaska.</p>

<p>How is this possible? Here are a few things that stood out to me…</p>
<h2>Left, Right, and Center – All German Politicians See a Green Future</h2>
<p>After two days in the German countryside, we made our way to Berlin, and to the Reichstag – where the German parliament meets, and where, a few weeks later, President Obama stood and hinted at a major climate announcement soon to come from Washington. After German reunification, this imposing building only steps from the Brandenburg Gate was restored by Sir Norman Foster, an English architect. Foster set out to make the Reichstag into the greenest parliament building in the world.  Now, a beautiful glass dome equipped with a solar-powered mirror, screen, and ventilation system allows both fresh air and daylight to stream into the parliament chambers. A combined heat and power plant (powered by rapeseed oil) provides energy to the Reichstag and several nearby buildings. Surplus heat is captured and stored a thousand feet below ground, until it is needed for heating during the winter.</p>

<p>In the Reichstag, we spoke with legislators and government officials from every side of the political spectrum – left, right, and center. What was striking to all of us in the group was their shared vision for a green Germany. They all bought into the economic and business case for the Energiewende as a way to maintain and grow Germany’s status as an economic powerhouse.</p>
<h2>Policy- and People-Powered Renewable Power</h2>
<p>In Berlin, we learned about the policy frameworks that set the energy transformation in motion. To see what this meant at the community level our hosts brought us to Husum, a town on the North Sea.  As our train sped through the German countryside, I was awestruck by the scenery – large wind turbines and farm buildings covered with solar panels amidst the bright yellow fields of rapeseed, and grazing livestock. </p>

<p>In Husum, we met farmers who pooled resources with neighbors to erect wind turbines, install solar panels on their buildings and in their fields, and to build biomass generators.  One farmer took us on a tour of his farm: “That&#39;s the wheat field, the barley field, the rapeseed field,” he said. “And over here,” he added, beaming, “is my solar field.” Another farmer took us on a tour of the wind turbines he built with his neighbors, and of his barns that he’d converted to office space for 14 staff he hired to manage the business aspects of his energy micro- enterprises. We also visited a farmer who has built a biogas plant that generates electricity and heat from pig manure, corn, beets, and factory byproducts.</p>

<p>When you look at the data on ownership of power generation in Germany, it is clear that the farmers we visited with aren’t outliers. <a href=""http://www.unendlich-viel-energie.de/english"">Germany’s Renewable Energy Agency</a> </p>

<p>Half of all German renewable energy capacity is owned by individuals. 11% of these are farmers like those we met in Husum. Only 6.5% is owned by utility companies.</p>

<p>Energy projects like the ones we saw were rapidly developed when Germany introduced what is called a “feed in tariff.” This policy guaranteed a steady return over 20 years for investors in renewable energy.  Based on this guaranteed revenue stream, a farmer could go to a bank and get a loan to finance the purchase and installation of a solar array on his barn or in his fields. The feed in tariff also gives priority to any renewable energy project that wants to connect into Germany’s energy grid, with no limits on the amount of energy. In these ways, feed in tariffs accelerate the development of the renewable energy industry and its entire supply chain, from manufacturers and suppliers to service providers. Meanwhile, regulators monitor and frequently adjust tariff rates for new contracts to give manufacturers the constant incentive to innovate and drive costs down.</p>

<p>Cooperatives are the common way for community members and farmers to invest in energy production.  Currently, over 80,000 citizens hold shares in collectively run systems for the generation of electricity and heat. Since 2010, the number of cooperatives has tripled (to 700). Andreas Wieg of <a href=""http://www.dgrv.de/en/home.html"">DGRV</a>, the national cooperative association, calls this ownership structure a “NIMBY-buster,” because acceptance levels for renewable energy increase as cooperative owners reap the direct financial benefits as shareholders. They also see the secondary benefits, as a growing clean energy market generates well-paying jobs, which, in turn generate tax revenues for their communities. And they’ve become a destination for energy tourists like us. That farmer with the 14 staff was gracious enough to lead us to the top of one of his wind turbines, from where I took the photo below. What a view! </p>

<p>This cooperative model is also beginning to have its followers in big cities like Berlin. One of the people we met there was 25 year old Arwen Colell, who organized a cooperative called, BuergerEnergie Berlin (Citizen Energy Berlin). Under Colell’s leadership, BuergerEnergie Berlin is pooling investments from members to make a bid for control of the city’s electricity distribution system. In their view, the utility currently managing that system has failed to keep pace with Germany&#39;s transition to renewable energy.  Clearly, this group has lit a fire under residents and mobilized them around something that is normally taken for granted – an electricity distribution network.</p>
<h2>Great Progress, but No Blueprint Yet for that Next 55%...</h2>
<p>Germany’s progress is impressive. Yet, there is no clear roadmap or blueprint for how it will get from 25% to 80% renewables. Policymakers are well aware of the heavy lift required to make the shift.  We met with Rainer Baake, a former State Secretary at the Environment Ministry and one of the architects of Energiewende, and now director of think tank, <a href=""http://www.agora-energiewende.de/"">Agora Energiewende</a>. He noted that progress in the coming years will depend on things like reforming the energy market design, investing in grid infrastructure upgrades, inventing new ways to more effectively store energy, and smart demand response mechanisms – which allow energy users to shift their consumption to times when supply is ample and prices are low.  Interestingly, the one thing that we have in the Northeast of the U.S. that the Germans don’t (at least not yet) is a market mechanism to allow demand response (turning down electricity use to help manage grid needs; <a href=""http://www.iso-ne.com/markets-operations/markets/forward-capacity-market"">see ISO New England</a>). But with the pace they are on, I wouldn’t be surprised if they are soon taking what we’ve been learning here, and putting it to work for them too.</p>

<p><em>In a new, related post on his <a href=""http://carscowscoal.blogspot.com/2013/07/why-is-germany-so-motivated-to-change.html"">&quot;Cars, Cows, and Coals&quot;</a> blog, Ben Paulos, one of my fellow travelers in Denmark and Germany, discusses five big ideas that motivated Germany to move so aggressively towards their energy goals.</em></p>"

And we continue to see the center as an important partner in creating a more robust out-of-school system that is increasing opportunities for children and young people in all of Boston’s neighborhoods. Thanks to concerted efforts on dropout prevention, high school graduation rates in the U.S. are the highest they’ve been since the 1970’s. Yet, every year roughly one million high school students still leave without a degree. The trends are similar in Boston. Though graduation rates are higher than they have ever been, among students who enrolled in Boston Public Schools as 9th graders in 2007, 2008, or 2009, the <a href=""http://www.bostonpublicschools.org/Page/695"">district’s most recent data</a> suggests 15-16 % dropped out. From these three cohorts alone, that is over 2,000 young people. </p>

<p>This is why it is so important to focus on creating pathways back to school and career for young people who drop out in addition to dropout prevention. One such effort that has been showing promising results is <a href=""http://www.bostonpic.org/programs/re-engagement-center-rec"">Boston’s Re-Engagement Center</a>, one of the nation’s first. Jointly staffed by the Boston Public Schools and the Boston Private Industry Council, over the last four years, Boston’s Re-Engagement Center has re-enrolled over 1,595 students, helping them get back on track towards college and career – leading Education Week to feature the center in June, 2013, in a special edition focused on dropout recovery (see <a href=""http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2013/06/06/34overview.h32.html"">“A ‘Neglected’ Population Goes Back to School”</a>).</p>

<p>This work reaps benefits for these students, but not to them alone. Education Week cites a 2011 study in Education Research International finding that, “Even after taking into account students who drop out multiple times, dropout recovery returns [to society] three times the money invested in it.”</p>"
52,Study Probes Consequences of Poor Transportation Options on Low-income Latinos,<p>A new study takes a deep look at the heavy toll of poor transportation options on one of the fastest growing populations in Massachusetts – low-income Latinos - and it recommends a path towards change that means greater prosperity for them and for low-income and working families across the state.</p>,"<p>Transportation is the fastest-growing source of greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change. Places like Boston and Massachusetts cannot achieve their emission reduction targets without offering more choices for people to get where they need to go. It’s simply not enough to put a bike share in a community, expand a transit line, or to increase bus service in another. We need to understand why people are choosing a particular mode of travel over another. For example, some choose to drive cars because they like to and can afford to. Others do so because it is the only way they have to get around. And, others can neither afford to own a vehicle, nor do they have access to reliable public transit choices where they live. If we embrace the fact that different circumstances affect people’s travel choices or lack thereof, then we will avoid designing interventions that simply don’t work. Powerful solutions need to be tailored to meet the specific needs and circumstances of each group.</p>

<p>This is why Barr commissioned a new study that was released in July 2013 by <a href=""http://www.n2nma.org/en/"">Neighbor to Neighbor</a> and the <a href=""http://www.northeastern.edu/dukakiscenter/"">Dukakis Center for Urban and Regional Policy</a>. Its purpose was to better understand the needs, challenges, and opportunities of Latinos - one of the fastest-growing populations in Massachusetts. Why Latinos? As the report highlights, this important demographic is usually under-represented in traditional research practices (e.g. work with large national datasets). It matters because this type of localized transportation research helps bring inequities to light and spark further dialogue. The authors outline a number of policy and planning recommendations to address the gaps.</p>

<p>The project involved interviewing mostly low-income and Latino residents in four different jurisdictions in Massachusetts (East Boston, Lynn, Worcester, and Springfield) between October 2012 and January 2013. 75% of respondents reported total household incomes below $20,000 and less than 6% had incomes greater than $40,000.</p>

<p>Overall, the reports found that many of these residents lack adequate access to affordable, efficient transportation options, and they make considerable sacrifices as a result. One concrete finding is that the current transportation system limits access to good jobs. How can low-income Latinos improve their economic standing without access to good jobs?</p>

<p>Other surprising takeaways: </p>

<ul>
<li>40% of the residents sampled do not have access to a car and 35% rely on public transportation as their primary transportation mode.</li>
<li>High transportation costs do have an impact on quality of life. Almost 40% of respondents have skipped a basic necessity in order to afford transportation. </li>
<li>63% said they do not have access to “everyday” destinations by walking, necessitating travel outside of their neighborhoods for many routine activities.</li>
<li>Three out of four of respondents agreed with the statement, “If public transportation was better, I would drive and/or be driven less.”<br></li>

51,A Tale of Two Peaks we Must Climb,"<p>Reducing GHG emissions 20% by 2020 is no easy task. Yet, 80% by 2050 is whole new kind of undertaking.

<p>The first is Mount Washington. At 6,288 feet, it is the highest peak in the United States east of the Mississippi River.</p>

<p>The second is Mount Everest, the highest peak in the world. 29,029 feet.</p>

<p>Last week, Boston was ranked the most energy efficient city in the country by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (<a href=""http://aceee.org/press/2013/09/report-ranks-us-cities-efforts-save-"">here&#39;s the press release</a>). That was great news for Barr and so many of our grantees who have played a part in putting Boston, and the whole state of Massachusetts on track to meet their 2020 goals of 25% reduction in emissions, compared to 2005 levels.</p>

<p>But what about that 80% by 2050 goal?</p>

<p>Recently, I have been thinking about these two peaks. On Mount Washington, the trails are well marked. And there’s even a paved road to the summit, if you don’t feel like climbing. Still, its summit has some of the most ferocious weather anywhere. So, no matter which route you take, getting to the top is never guaranteed.</p>

<p>This is much like our 2020 goals. Boston and Massachusetts, and other cities, states, and countries (recall my posts on <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/some-things-inspiring-in-the-state-of-denmark/"">Copenhagen</a> and <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/energievergnuegen-the-joy-of-renewable-energy/"">Germany</a>) are at the vanguard of sustainability. Last week I was in Memphis for a meeting of the <a href=""http://usdn.org/home.html"">Urban Sustainability Directors Network</a>, which Barr supports. Many of the cities represented are on track to meet their 2020 goals too. But there was much discussion about how the going is going to get tougher. We are running out of low-hanging fruit. We can and must do more of what we’re doing now, and do it better, to reach the fruit on higher branches. Yet that’s just to reach the Mount Washington, 2020 goals. Getting to the top of Mount Washington says very little about our ability to reach the summit of Mount Everest.</p>

<p>Ascending Mount Everest is a whole new kind of undertaking. There is no road you can drive to the summit. It takes more specialized equipment, technical skills, and a much deeper level of commitment.</p>

<p>It is a completely new world up there – as different as our future must be from today, when the world still depends on fossil fuels to meet 66 percent of energy demand. In the United States, it’s 82%.</p>

<p>We have a long way to go. Yet we are determined to make the climb, and to do what we can – even while slogging our way up Mount Washington – to help bring about the new ways of thinking and doing required to reach that loftier peak.</p>"

47,Three Keys to Breakthrough on Complex Social Contract Issues,"<p>When complicated politics and old wounds keep deep-sixing change efforts, what does it take to get to a new outcome? A recent breakthrough in Boston suggests a template.</p>","<p>Until this year, parents wishing to enroll their child in the Boston Public Schools faced a school assignment system that had been in place since 1988. This system divided Boston into three sprawling zones. Each had dozens of schools for parents to consider, and no guarantee their child would be placed in any they preferred. They might get lucky and land a seat in a first-choice school around the corner. Or they might be assigned a last-choice school a long bus ride away.</p>

<p>For years, families, city leaders, and school officials called for a better approach – one that was easier and more predictable for families, while also promising equitable access to high quality schools closer to home. But time and again, change efforts failed. Old wounds kept resurfacing and the politics proved too complicated.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, however, Boston had a breakthrough. After a wide-open community process that drew ideas and comments from over 5,000 people, the Boston School Committee approved a new system now scheduled to launch in January, 2014. </p>

<p>Barr’s Evaluation Director, Rahn Dorsey, served on the committee appointed by the Mayor to oversee that process. After it was all over, I sat with Rahn, and asked him what he thought were the keys to breakthrough. He pointed to three:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Making available a huge, public-use data set</strong> for anyone to work with to understand the challenges and generate possible solutions</li>
<li><strong>A public institution acting as facilitator</strong> of a community process, not salesman of pre-determined solutions</li>
<li><strong>Maintaining the integrity of the public space</strong> so that anyone, from any corner of the community can put ideas on the table, and know they will be taken seriously</li>
</ol>

46,From Urban Wasteland to Great Neighborhood,"<p>Since 2005, when the MBTA abandoned its Bartlett Yard bus facility, the 8.5-acre site in Boston's Roxbury neighborhood had become an urban wasteland. Thanks to a unanimous vote earlier this fall by the Boston Redevelopment Authority, the site's transformation into a mixed-use, smart growth development took a big step forward.</p>","<p>The MBTA has been trying to dispose of Bartlett Yard for years. The first time a developer created a set of plans for Bartlett Yard, the proposal was for a pair of big box retailers, a supermarket, and a giant parking lot. The community roundly rejected this idea. Instead, two Barr grantees - the <a href=""http://ma-smartgrowth.org/"">Massachusetts Smart Growth Alliance</a> and <a href=""http://www.nuestracdc.org/properties/60-bartlett-place"">Neustra Communidad</a> (which had the help of a <a href=""http://www.enterprisecommunity.com/solutions-and-innovation/design-leadership/rose-architectural-fellowship"">Rose Architectural Fellow</a>, another Barr grantee) - worked with residents to provide technical support on the design of a truly great neighborhood.</p>

<p>What they came up with – a concept called “<a href=""http://www.bartlettplace.net/about.php"">Bartlett Place</a>&quot; – is amazing: a walkable village that will integrate elements like an open-air market, shops, a public common, arts and events venues, and places to sit and relax outdoors.

<p>The way we build our communities has a huge impact on greenhouse gas emission. According to <a href=""https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/%28ASCE%290733-9488%282006%29132%3A1%2810%29"">a 2006 study</a> that appeared in the Journal of Planning and Development, people living in low-density areas emit over 2.5 times as much CO2 per person per year as people living in high-density areas, with most of the difference attributed to emissions from single occupancy vehicles. That is why Barr is focused on smart growth as part of its strategy to reduce emissions from transportation. <a href=""http://ma-smartgrowth.org/gn/"">Great Neighborhoods</a> works to create more vibrant, walkable, and sustainable communities in Boston’s metropolitan area by implementing a regional vision of smart growth and supporting local partners. The emphasis is on capacity building, land-use/transportation planning, and zoning in ways that reduce environmental impacts (e.g., greenhouse gases, vehicle miles traveled, energy consumption, loss of open space, and ground water use). </p>

43,New Report Shows Declining Emissions Amidst Growing Economy,"<p>What happens when a state gets serious about climate change? A new report says the answer, at least in Massachusetts, is a shrinking carbon footprint and a growing economy.</p>","<p>In 2008, Massachusetts passed the Global Warming Solutions Act, which ranks as one of the most ambitious climate change policy frameworks in the country. The Act called for a 25% reduction in emissions below 1990 levels by 2020 and it helped spark, among many other things, significant new investments in energy efficiency and clean energy. At the end of last year, Massachusetts’ energy and environment office issued <a href=""http://www.mass.gov/eea/docs/eea/gwsa/ma-gwsa-5yr-progress-report-1-6-14.pdf"">a progress report</a>.</p>

<p>One of the findings that really grabbed my attention was featured in this chart: </p>

<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/16/small.jpg?1642115525 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/16/medium.jpg?1642115525 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/16/large.jpg?1642115525 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/16/x_large.jpg?1642115525 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""Massachusetts Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Economic Growth 1990-2011"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/16/small.jpg?1642115525"" /> </div> </div></p>

<p>It shows that, from 1990 to 2010, Massachusetts emissions fell 11 percent, even as the economy grew by 60 percent. Good news for businesses and the environment alike. While we know that national and international actions are necessary to fully address climate change, Barr has focused on helping Boston and Massachusetts demonstrate the art of the possible on climate action. Much work remains. But we are encouraged by trend lines like this.</p>

<p>In addition to the moment-in-time snapshot offered by this report, a new performance management dashboard (which Barr helped to fund) will provide a dynamic picture of progress towards Massachusetts’ 2020 goals.</p>

42,"Innovation in Parent Engagement Among Public, Parochial, and Charter Schools","<p>Parent engagement has never been the biggest part of Barr's K-12 grantmaking, but it has long been an important one. Read about a new effort that is helping a cohort of Boston district, charter, and parochial schools test and share new methods for engaging parents, and a new graduate-level program for the next generation of family engagement professionals.</p>","<p>Parent engagement has never been the biggest part of <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/education"">Barr’s K-12 grantmaking</a>, but it has long been an important one. Numerous research studies have shown that family engagement markedly improves children’s’ success in school (consider this <a href=""http://www.hfrp.org/publications-resources/browse-our-publications/parental-involvement-and-student-achievement-a-meta-analysis"">meta-analysis of 77 studies comprising over 300,000 students</a>). Irrespective of race, ethnicity, or income, students with involved parents are more likely to earn higher grades and test scores and to perform well on many other measures. Yet, it remains the exceptional school that effectively engages all parents, especially working parents, low-income, and immigrant parents. In light of this challenge, in 2012, we provided a grant to the <a href=""http://www.wheelock.edu/academics/centers-and-institutes/aspire-institute"">Aspire Institute</a> at Wheelock College to launch the <a href=""http://www.wheelock.edu/academics/centers-and-institutes/aspire-institute/current-programs/family-engagement-partnership"">Boston Family Engagement Partnership</a>.</p>

<p>In its first year, the Boston Family Engagement Partnership formed a cohort of ten Boston schools, including district, charter, and parochial schools. Participants worked together to develop and test new approaches to engaging parents, and to share their learning with each other and the field. Wheelock also created a graduate-level program designed to train the next generation of family engagement professionals and leaders in schools. One of the first fellows is Tabitha Rosien, a former teacher and current school administrator, who was featured in a terrific recent interview on the Aspire Institute blog, “<a href=""http://blog.wheelock.edu/category/aspire-wire/"">The Aspire Wire</a>”:</p>

<p>One of the things Tabitha describes is a series of focus groups with parents about what they value most in school-family engagement. Three themes emerged:</p>

<ol>
<li>The importance of consistent communication between school and home</li>
<li>Families wanting education on how teachers are teaching</li>
<li>A strong interest in more opportunities to build relationships with other families<br></li>
</ol>

38,Boston Businesses Show Art of Possible on Climate Action,"<p>At a kickoff for a new cohort of Boston-area businesses embracing the ""Challenge for Sustainability,"" I had the chance to talk about the part they play in creating a more sustainable (and hopeful) world.</p>","<p>I was recently invited to speak at the kickoff for a new cohort of participants in the <a href=""http://www.barrfoundation.org/news/networks-fun-and-healthy-competition-spur-boston-businesses-on-sustainabili/"">Challenge for Sustainability</a>.</p>

<p>Run by <a href=""http://www.abettercity.org/"">A Better City</a>, the Challenge works with area businesses to implement sustainability and efficiency measures. Challenge participants join the network to track progress and impacts, and share ideas and learn new strategies. It is a highly motivated and growing network of leaders on climate action in Boston. Now in its fifth year of operation, the Challenge has grown from 18 facilities representing five million square feet to 105 facilities representing 30 million square feet.</p>

<p>Here’s what I said…</p>

<p><em>Thank you so much for the opportunity to speak today. You all are my heroes. Every day you are increasing efficiency, recycling, using more clean energy and getting people out of their cars. Collectively, you are making Boston a national leader in the fight to address climate change. You are saving money and resources while also making your employers leaders in their field. Your investments have ripple effects throughout the economy spurring innovation and entrepreneurship and creating jobs.</em></p>

<p><em>The Barr Foundation is guided by a vision for a vibrant, just, and sustainable world with hopeful futures for children. One of our major focus areas is climate change, where we have been supporting efforts to help Boston and Massachusetts meet or beat their targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We chose to focus locally because we saw the potential for Boston and the state to lead by example, and to demonstrate the art of the possible on climate action.</em></p>

<p><em>So, we have invested in efforts to accelerate energy efficiency and increase clean transportation choices in major market segments. The Challenge for Sustainability is a critical partner for the commercial real estate sector.</em></p>

<p><em>For three years running, Massachusetts has been ranked the <a href=""http://www.barrfoundation.org/news/massachusetts-named-most-energy-efficient-state-again/"">most energy efficient state in the country</a>. For the first time this year, cities were ranked too. <a href=""http://www.barrfoundation.org/news/a-tale-of-two-peaks-we-must-climb/"">Boston came out on top</a>, ahead of New York, San Francisco, and even Portlandia.</em></p>

<p><em>Programs like the Challenge are a big part of that leadership. So far, these efforts have rolled up to a consistent 3% average annual reduction in CO2; a reduction of 15,000 tons of CO2 since 2009 (equivalent to the energy use for 1250 homes); and in 2013 alone, 19 million kwh in electricity savings (worth $1.7 million in avoided expenses to participants). That is a really big deal.</em></p>

<p><em>Now, are you up for an even bigger challenge?</em></p>

<p><em>To meet our 2020 goals we need a cumulative reduction from the commercial sector of 600,000 metric tons. That is roughly equivalent to the amount of power used by 30,000 homes.</em></p>

<p><em>I know you are all up for the challenge and knowing the team at ABC, they will make it fun as well.</em></p>

<p><em>My thanks to each of you for being part of the solution. It helps put the hope in the hopeful future I have for my teenage son, and that we all have for all of our children.</em></p>

<p><em>Thank you.</em></p>

<p>This four-minute video also gives a great glimpse into the Challenge, and how they have engaged with Boston businesses big and small:</p>

37,"What If We Focus on Moving People, Not Vehicles?","<p>Recently a group from Boston took a learning tour to Mexico City to get a firsthand look at its world-class transportation network. A new video offers highlights from the trip and inspiration for Boston and other modern cities looking for better ways to get more people where they want to go more quickly, efficiently, and safely.</p>","<p>In December I joined a group of transportation, development, and community leaders from Boston for a learning tour to Mexico City. This was a subset of a larger group that has been studying the feasibility of <a href=""https://go.itdp.org/display/live/The+BRT+Standard+2013"">Bus Rapid Transit</a> (BRT) for Greater Boston, with support from Barr and the <a href=""http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org"">Rockefeller Foundation</a>.</p>

<p>We went to Mexico City to get a firsthand look at what it has done to become a global leader in urban mobility. What an inspiring and eye-opening experience! We brought a local filmmaker with us to help document what we saw and learned. I am excited to share “When the Goal is Moving People, Not Vehicles. Lessons from Mexico”</p>

<p>A few highlights from the video and about Mexico City’s MetroBus Bus Rapid Transit system:</p>

<ul>
<li>It carries more than 850,000 passengers every day (compared to 1.3 million per day for Boston’s entire MBTA system of commuter rail, subways, trolleys, and buses)</li>
<li>It has reduced the number of daily car trips in Mexico City by 122,000</li>
<li>On average, riders experienced a forty-percent cut in travel times</li>
</ul>

<p>One of my favorite takeaways from the trip (captured in this video in a quote by Clinton Bench of the Massachusetts Department of transportation) is how inspiring it is to see a city shift from focusing on how to move vehicles to how to move people as quickly efficiently and safely as possible through key corridors. The focus on people has improved the transit system in Mexico and has other positive ripple effects, such as increased pedestrian activity along shopping districts and greater use of public spaces.</p>

<p>What would happen if Boston and other U.S. cities used that frame?</p>

34,A Route to Climb Everest,"<p>A new report from Environment Northeast suggests a pathway to reach the daunting, but necessary goal of reducing carbon emissions by 80% by 2050.</p>","<p>Last fall, I wrote about the difference between our 2020 and 2050 climate goals being like the difference between climbing Mount Washington (tough slogging required, but well-marked trails leading to the summit) and Mount Everest (demands new ways of thinking and doing and deeper commitment).</p>

<p>To help begin the work of mapping a route to that loftier summit, Barr made a grant to <a href=""http://www.env-ne.org/"">Environment Northeast</a> (ENE) to develop a set of possible pathways to meet our 2050 goals. The result was the newly-released <a href=""http://www.env-ne.org/resources/detail/energyvision"">ENE EnergyVision</a>. In it, ENE envisions an energy system that looks very different from the one we have today, with a massive shift towards electricity for vehicles and buildings, and towards renewable energy, as suggested in the illustration below: </p>

<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/12/small.jpg?1642115504 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/12/medium.jpg?1642115504 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/12/large.jpg?1642115504 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/12/x_large.jpg?1642115504 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""Full Electrification Illustration courtesy of ENE"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/12/small.jpg?1642115504"" /> <div class=""FancyAttribution""> <p>ENE</p> </div> </div> </div></p>

<p>Some highlights from the report:</p>

<ul>
<li>If all gasoline powered vehicles and buildings using fossil fuels shifted to electric technologies today, GHG emissions would fall by nearly 50 percent.</li>
<li>GHG emissions can be further reduced by 80 percent or more as additional renewable generation is added to the grid.</li>
<li>Electric vehicle and high efficiency electric heating technologies offer operating costs that are lower, by as much as 70 percent, than their traditional fossil-fueled counterparts.</li>
</ul>

<p>While the solutions ENE advocates for are all viable (i.e., the technologies are available and will continue to improve rapidly in the years to come), making the new energy system a reality will be a challenge. States, regional power systems, and federal agencies will all need to adopt new policies, introduce new market incentives and regulatory reforms, change outdated approaches, uproot old technologies, and apply new ways of thinking about energy options. In the coming months, ENE will be working with stakeholders to develop an implementation roadmap.</p>

31,A Wonk-Free Secret to Great Placemaking,<p>Is the secret of a great place the proper placement of its streetlights? The font choice and color scheme of its signage? Its WalkScore? Or something else entirely?</p>,"<p>Is the secret of a great place the proper placement of its streetlights? In the font choice and color scheme of its signage? In its <a href=""https://www.redfin.com/how-walk-score-works"">WalkScore</a>?</p>

<p>Earlier this month, I had the chance to go to <a href=""http://www.artplaceamerica.org/"">ArtPlace</a>’s grantee summit in Los Angeles, where a new answer to these questions was a breath of fresh air for at least one design and planning geek (i.e., me).</p>

<p>I came to Barr’s <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/climate/mobility"">Transportation and Smart Growth</a> team after finishing graduate work in urban design and planning. I also sit on the planning board of my hometown on Boston’s South Shore. This has given me many opportunities to debate the minutiae of placemaking. In these circles, the typical recommended recipe looks something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Take ¼ mile of urban land.</li>
<li>Remove 20% of parking spaces.</li>
<li>Place a transit station at center.</li>
<li>Add colorful signage to taste.</li>
<li>Liberally sprinkle locally produced food and energy</li>
<li>Blend with mixed-use affordable housing.</li>
<li>Bake for 10-20 years.</li>
</ol>

<p>At the ArtPlace summit, I heard about a different ingredient that makes that old recipe seem rather bland and ivory-tower theoretical – namely, people. </p>

<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/267/small.jpg?1642116322 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/267/medium.jpg?1642116322 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/267/large.jpg?1642116322 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/267/x_large.jpg?1642116322 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""PITTSBURGH CENTRAL NORTHSIDE ARTWAY CONNECTOR.

<p>Transportation planners and “complete streets” advocates help focus on access to and from, and movement through places. Economic developers focus on job creation in a place. Smart Growth types focus on identifying the most sustainable places to add density to places. But the folks at ArtPlace were all focused on people, voice, and the quality of life and vibrancy in places, not just their statistics and features, but what it takes to create places people want to be, and to be a part of.</p>

<p>It was inspiring to hear about places across the country where this is already happening (Lauren featured a <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/putting-art-at-the-center-of-community-transformation/"">few of them</a> recently, A few more are on ArtPlace’s <a href=""http://www.artplaceamerica.org/articles/americas-top-artplaces-2013/"">2013 list of top ArtPlaces</a>).</p>

<p>I look forward to more opportunities to break out of my designer/planner silo, and to invite more artists into mine.</p>"
30,The Tyranny of School Fees,"<p>A recent site visit with two Barr Global grantees in Eastern Africa left me reassured about their progress towards outcomes, but troubled by other persistent challenges facing the rural poor.</p>","<p>What do you see in this picture? And what do you make of it? </p>

<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/134/small.jpg?1642116015 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/134/medium.jpg?1642116015 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/134/large.jpg?1642116015 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/134/x_large.jpg?1642116015 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""One Acre Kids in Kenya"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/134/small.jpg?1642116015"" /> <div class=""FancyAttribution""> <p>Heiner Baumann</p> </div> </div> </div></p>

<p>This was a group of children that greeted us during a recent visit to Western Kenya with <a href=""http://www.oneacrefund.org/"">One Acre Fund</a>, one of Barr’s grantees.</p>

<p>Whenever I go on site visits, I go with hopes to bring value—whether new ideas, networks, or resources. I also go to see, listen, and learn about progress, challenges, and opportunities our partners face, and especially about those we seek to impact. This visit was no exception.</p>

<p>When I saw these children, the first thing that came to mind was, “It’s Monday at 10:00 in the morning and these children are not in school.” I also noticed some were in tidy school uniforms. Others were not. I asked the mother of two of the children in uniform about this. She explained that, while two of her children were in school, these two were not (though they had attended some school in the past and were sporting their uniforms for our visit). She confirmed that the situation was similar for the other children in the photo as well.</p>

<p>“Why,” I asked? “The tyranny of the school fees,” she said.</p>

<p>A few days earlier we had been in the Rwenzori Mountains of Western Uganda visiting another grantee, <a href=""http://fairtradeusa.org"">Fair Trade USA</a>. There we observed the same issue. While we saw many kids in school, like those in the photo below, when we spoke with a teacher he told us that, despite it being the second week of school, only about two thirds of the kids had so far “arrived.”</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/102/small.jpg?1642115849 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/102/medium.jpg?1642115849 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/102/large.jpg?1642115849 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/102/x_large.jpg?1642115849 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""Fair Trade Kids"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/102/small.jpg?1642115849"" /> <div class=""FancyAttribution""> <p>Fair Trade</p> </div> </div> </div></p>

<p>That money was a big issue was not surprising. But something in the way the woman used the word “tyranny” made me think.</p>

<p>Back at home, I looked up the numbers. According to the World Bank, the official primary school net enrollment rate in Uganda is ninety-one percent (2011)—a big improvement from sixty-two percent in 1992. Much of the progress stemmed from the introduction of universal, tuition-free public primary education in Uganda in 1997.</p>

<p>Yet “tuition free” is, in fact, not free. Many fees persist—including for meals, books, and mandatory uniforms. In Kenya, for example, costs for uniforms and materials are in the range of $10–$20 per student per year. Expenses for food can be an additional $35 per child. These are for primary school. For secondary school, families pay roughly $250 per student per year. These may not seem like large amounts. Yet, with typical household incomes of a few hundred dollars per year, it is easy to see why school fees can be unaffordable.</p>

<p>Barr’s grant to One Acre Fund has, at least on its surface, nothing to do with education. It is focused on supporting the organization’s work with small-hold farmers to increase their incomes and livelihoods. One Acre Fund provides financing, seed and fertilizer, training, and post-harvest market support. It also provides tools to reduce energy use and to build resilience to a changing climate, such as tree seeds, rain index insurance, and solar lighting. Yet, farmers are not only farmers. They are also providers for their families, including children who need schooling. On average, small-hold farmers working with One Acre Found double profits on every planted acre and earn an additional $140 per year. Of that additional income, roughly $35 is typically used to buy food. The rest is used in varying ways, including for school fees.</p>

<p>Yet the challenge of paying school fees isn’t only the money. Many other factors can prevent children from attending schools, such as schools being far from home (a hindrance for smaller children), or help needed at home (an issue for older children, especially girls). Not having money then is the final straw, or one challenge too many. And even where groups like One Acre Fund can help increase family incomes, timing remains an issue. With participants being paid at harvest time and school fees due at planting, as we noticed in Uganda, there is a growing market for middle men. A middle man will stop, for example, at a farmer’s gate where he sees kids not in school. I would be happy to cover your children’s school fees, he says, if only you will fill these two bags with coffee at harvest time.</p>

<p>From the perspective of increasing access to school, this arrangement appears positive. Yet striking this bargain typically erodes farmers’ profits significantly. In return for cash now, they get a lousy price. For the coffee farmer in Western Uganda, the market price of those two bags of coffee may be a multiple of the school fees. Yet without savings or access to credit on more favorable terms, families have no other choice. As a result, many children, like those in the pictures, are going to school in fits and starts, or not at all.</p>

<p>To begin to address this challenge, One Acre is currently testing a maize loan storage program with 1,000 farmers. One Acre will store the Maize for the farmer so the maize can be sold closer to the time when school fees are due. Apart from the benefit of having money for school fees when they need it, families will typically also have more money, as maize prices long after harvest time are often significantly higher than right at the time when supply is at its peak.</p>

<p>Overall, our visit left me satisfied that One Acre Fund and Fair Trade are both on track to meet the benchmarks and outcomes we agreed to when Barr made those grants. I also felt encouraged that the 130,000 families served in 2013 by One Acre Fund were able to buy about 18,000 new and additional school years for their children. Yet, as usual, being on the ground and getting a deeper sense of what life is like for the rural poor, I left with many more questions about what can and must be done so that, one day, when I visit on a Monday at 10:00 in the morning, the only children I see are those too young for school.</p>"
28,New Report Raises Stakes for Education in Massachusetts,<p>A new project from the Rennie Center for Education Research & Policy sets out to provide an annual review of student progress and proficiency to inform education leaders and policy makers about what we are doing well and where we need to improve.</p>,"<p>While Massachusetts is touted as a national leader on education, the state is still a long way from ensuring all students are on track to succeed. Significant readiness and performance gaps persist at every phase along the education pipeline, from birth through college and career. To help inform education leaders and policy makers about what we are doing well and where we need to improve, the Rennie Center for Education Research &amp; Policy recently launched its <a href=""http://www.renniecenter.org/condition-education"">Condition of Education in the Commonwealth</a> project, which Barr helped to fund. An annual review of student progress and proficiency in Massachusetts, the project will monitor four critical stages in student learning and development:</p>

<ol>
<li>School readiness and early learning</li>
<li>Student performance and engagement</li>
<li>Successful preparation for and transitions to post-secondary education</li>
<li>Postsecondary progress and attainment</li>
</ol>

<p>The project also tracks the preparedness and effectiveness of teachers in the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>For school readiness and early learning, for example, here are the indicators for 2013:<br>
<div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/133/small.png?1642116004 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/133/medium.png?1642116004 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/133/large.png?1642116004 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/133/x_large.png?1642116004 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""early education graphic"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/133/small.png?1642116004"" /> </div> </div> </p>

<p>To see how Massachusetts fared on the other indicators in 2013, and to track future reports, which will take deeper dives into the data and provide policy recommendations, visit the <a href=""http://www.renniecenter.org/"">Rennie Center</a>.</p>

<p>Barr’s goal for public education is to eliminate achievement gaps in Boston. Though the Condition of Education provides a statewide assessment, we saw it as a critical input for education leaders fashioning the next generation of education policies that will impact students in Boston and across the commonwealth.</p>"
26,Helping the Green Economy Work for All,"<p>If we care about equity, we ignore climate change at our peril. Climate change is an inequity expander and accelerator. But it doesn't have to be. The Green Justice Coalition, a Barr grantee, has been showing the way to meet both climate and equity goals.</p>","<p>If we care at all about equity we ignore climate change at our peril. Climate change is an inequity expander and accelerator. Those least responsible for causing it are the most vulnerable to its effects. The poor who consume fewer resources who live more lightly on the earth are generally the most vulnerable. When flooding or droughts cold snaps or heat waves hit their household budgets get hit harder. And regaining their footing is often much harder too. This is true globally as well as here in the US as we saw in the wake of Katrina Sandy and are sure to see again. </p>

<p>To make matters worse the ways we work to address climate change can add additional burdens on the poor without their fair share of benefits. For example in Massachusetts all households pay what&#39;s called a &quot;systems benefits charge&quot; on their utility bills. This raises revenue the state sends back to residents in the form of subsidies or rebates for efficiency upgrades or renewable energy for their homes and businesses. But since those upgrades cost money up front historically middle and upper income families were the only ones to take advantage of the programs. All pay but only some benefit. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t have to be this way. </p>

<p>Thanks to the work of the <a href=""https://www.cleanwateraction.org/features/green-justice-coalition"">Green Justice Coalition</a> a Barr grantee this dynamic is changing – and we are moving closer to ensuring that our region&#39;s growing green economy yields benefits for low-income communities and communities of color. Last month the Nation <a href=""http://www.thenation.com/blog/179505/how-create-green-economy-works-all#"">featured the coalition</a> in an article that picks up on work we featured here two years ago in a <a href=""http://www.barrfoundation.org/news/new-report-says-its-worth-reaching-the-hard-to-reach/"">guest post by Darlene Lombos</a> of <a href=""http://massclu.org/"">Community Labor United</a> which is the lead organization of the coalition. Darlene shared lessons from their novel and effective approach at outreach to low- and moderate-income households to engage them in energy efficiency programs.    </p>

23,A Broader View of Community Transformation,"<p>To the benefit of the communities they serve, many nonprofits take a broader view of their work than their funders.</p>","<p>When people struggle, when their communities are not environmentally sustainable, socially equitable, or economically prosperous, the challenges they face are often not only about the environment, or education, or health, or any other single issue. They are all of the above issues. As a member of the climate team at Barr, my charge is to help communities grow in smarter, less car-dependent ways, with better, cheaper, faster ways of getting where they need to go. Yet, I know this work is only one piece of a complex puzzle. Thankfully, some of our partners take a broader view. And communities are being transformed because of it. </p>

<p>One terrific example is the subject of a new report on the <a href=""http://www.gfcac.org/"">Greater Four Corners Action Coalition</a>, which is led by <a href=""http://www.barrfoundation.org/fellows/classes/class-of-2009/marvin-martin/"">Marvin Martin</a>, who became a Barr Fellow in 2009. </p>

<p>In recent years, Barr’s climate program has supported the Greater Four Corners Action Coalition to educate and organize residents around improving transportation options. One of the recent successes this contributed to is the opening of a new train station with direct service to downtown Boston - after decades during which residents watched commuter trains cut right through their neighborhood, but needed to depend on personal vehicles or busses themselves. </p>

<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/98/small.jpg?1642115837 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/98/medium.jpg?1642115837 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/98/large.jpg?1642115837 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/98/x_large.jpg?1642115837 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""Geneva Ave"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/98/small.jpg?1642115837"" /> </div> </div> </p>

<p>This was a great win for climate and for equity. Yet it is a success that stands on the shoulders of over two decades of faithful work building capacity from the grassroots helping residents reclaim their neighborhood and define the future they wanted to create together.</p>

22,Rewriting the Playbook on How we Get Around,"<p>As Boston prepares for a citywide visioning process on the future of mobility, one Barr grantee has been priming the pump with bold ideas and new thinking about what a world-class transportation network might look like.</p>","<p>In January Mary Skelton Roberts asked the question <a href=""http://www.barrfoundation.org/news/what-if-we-focus-on-moving-people-instead-of-cars/"">&quot;What if we focused on moving people not vehicles?&quot;</a> It was a question inspired by a learning tour to Mexico City where we joined a group of transportation development and community leaders from Boston to get a firsthand look at the city&#39;s amazing Bus Rapid Transit System. Meanwhile the Boston Society of Architects (BSA) has been raising similar questions every month in its <a href=""http://www.architects.org/news/mid-series-recap-traffic-advisory-speaker-series"">&quot;Traffic Advisory&quot;</a> series which Barr has supported and in which leaders from around the world have shared insights and innovations from other cities that are re-writing the playbook on urban mobility. Traffic Advisory invites Bostonians to envision new possibilities in the way cities are designed and to reimagine all of Boston as a more connected and more walkable city. </p>

<p>The next session is tomorrow. But first a recap... </p>

<p>In November <a href=""http://www.architects.org/news/traffic-advisory-speaker-series-pedestrian-and-bike-systems-0"">Helle Søholt</a> CEO of Gehl Architects described what it took for Copenhagen to become a healthier safer more connected city where over 50% of people get around by bike (see <a href=""http://www.barrfoundation.org/news/some-things-inspiring-in-the-state-of-denmark/"">Mariella Puerto&#39;s reflections</a> from her visit there in 2013 ). Helle also described the transformation of New York City&#39;s infamously congested Broadway into a pedestrian-friendly boulevard. <a href=""http://www.architects.org/news/traffic-advisory-speaker-series-beyond-smart-cities-0"">Ryan Chin</a> of the <a href=""http://cities.media.mit.edu/"">City Science Initiative</a> at MIT Media Lab wowed the crowd with his introduction to on-demand personal transit folding cars and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEH01UvjzD0#t=17"">CityScope&#39;s Lego block 3D urban planning tools</a>. </p>

<p>Last month Dr. Ignazio Marino the Mayor of Rome which is a far older and more congested city than Boston shared his inspiring reflections on the political courage it takes to push for walking and biking in a city with 97% vehicle ownership. </p>

<p>Strategies for Children has worked to build a statewide movement for high-quality early education so that children enter school ready to succeed. More recently it has extended its focus to ensure that children in Massachusetts are proficient readers by the end of third grade. On June 7, 2014, Strategies for Children co-sponsored a gubernatorial candidates forum on early childhood and education.</p>

20,Building on What's Working in Early Education in Boston,<p>Ambitious goals and new developments set to expand and build on successful efforts to provide high-quality pre-kindergarten programs in Boston.</p>,"<p>On May 6, 2014, Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh <a href=""http://www.cityofboston.gov/news/default.aspx?id=8613"">announced a new Advisory Committee on Universal Pre-Kindergarten</a>. The committee, of which I am a part, is tasked with creating a city-wide plan to double the enrollment of four-year-olds in high-quality, full-day pre-kindergarten programs by 2018. &quot;Rather than spend time on remediation in education,&quot; the mayor noted, &quot;we are investing in our youngest students to lay the groundwork for their long-term success and the long-term prosperity of Boston.&quot;</p>

<p>In 2006, <a href=""http://www.bostonpublicschools.org"">Boston Public Schools</a> (BPS) took a first step toward universal pre-kindergarten when it began expanding its &quot;K1&quot; preschool program. Steadily adding seats each year, the district now enrolls 2,200 four-year-olds in its K1 program. Over that same period the Barr Foundation provided a series of grants that supported the district&#39;s plan to improve and maintain high quality.</p>

<p>BPS adopted rigorous curricula, provided professional development and coaching so that teachers could use the curricula effectively, and is on its way to having all of its preschool classrooms accredited by the <a href=""http://www.naeyc.org"">National Association for the Education of Young Children</a>, which promotes excellence in early childhood education. <a href=""http://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/13/03/study-finds-large-pre-k-impact"">A recent Harvard study</a> found that the BPS preschool program is substantially improving children&#39;s readiness for kindergarten and their chances for success in later grades. This success has drawn national attention. In March, Seattle Mayor Ed Murray and a delegation of city officials visited Boston to see BPS&#39;s pre-kindergarten program firsthand. (<a href=""http://www.dotnews.com/2014/seattle-mayor-leads-delegation-tour-boston-schools"">Read more about the visit</a>.)</p>

<p>Now Mayor Walsh has made doubling the number of pre-kindergarten seats an early priority in his administration. This is an exciting moment for Boston for all of us who have been working in early education and care, and especially for Boston families with young children.</p>

<p>With roughly 6,000 four-year-olds currently living in Boston and a range of factors important to families, we know that doubling the supply of high-quality pre-kindergarten seats can happen only with a comprehensive plan. For that reason the Advisory Committee has been asked to recommend a strategy that considers community-based pre-kindergarten programs, as well as expansion of BPS&#39;s K1 capacity.</p>

<p>Recognizing that parents choose from a range of community-based and school-based early care and education programs, Barr has long supported efforts to increase and maintain quality among community-based pre-kindergarten programs. Stay tuned for future posts on two demonstration projects that highlight these community-based approaches that complement the partnership with BPS described in this post.</p>

19,Time to Reset Philanthropy’s “Default Settings”,"<p>In philanthropy, we too often obsess about strategy without attending to one of the things that puts strategy most at risk: culture.</p>","<p><em>Two young fish are swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way who nods at them and says “Morning boys. How’s the water?” And the two young fish swim on for a bit and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes “What the hell is water?”</em> </p>

<p>This parable is from a 2005 commencement speech at Kenyon College by David Foster Wallace the late author. “The point of the fish story,” Wallace went on to say, “is merely that the most obvious and important things are the hardest to see and talk about.” </p>

<p>In the midst of a commencement of sorts of my own at the Barr Foundation, I have been reflecting on the incredible opportunities facing organized philanthropy today. Recalling Wallace’s words, I have also been thinking about one of those obvious, important, hard-to-see, hard-to-talk-about aspects of our work that may well be our biggest obstacle to realizing those opportunities—namely, our culture, or what Wallace describes as our “default settings.” </p>

<p>In an op-ed appearing earlier this week in <em>The Chronicle of Philanthropy</em>, I draw attention to four of these “default settings” that I think most hinder progress in our field, including:  </p>

<ol>
<li>Obsessing over the new (and neglecting the tried and true)<br></li>
<li>Too rigid a reliance on models and metrics<br></li>
<li>Going it alone<br></li>
<li>Focusing inward<br></li>
</ol>

<p>For each of these I also propose a default setting reset for philanthropy to better meet the pressing challenges of our times. </p>

<p class=""tyler"">Read the article<a href=""https://www.philanthropy.com/article/as-the-role-of-foundations-changes-we-need-to-alter-our-default-attitudes/%22%5D"">https://www.philanthropy.com/article/as-the-role-of-foundations-changes-we-need-to-alter-our-default-attitudes/&quot;]</a></p>"
18,From the President – July 2014,"<p>After his first two months at Barr, President Jim Canales shares what he’s been learning and some key themes to guide us on the road ahead.</p>","<p>It has now been two months since I joined the Barr Foundation, and it seems a good time to share some initial impressions, as well as to provide an update on some of our activities.</p>

<p>As I had anticipated, I have learned a great deal during these initial weeks on board. I have met with leaders and residents from across the Boston area in both one-on-one and larger group settings; I have toured parts of Dorchester and Roxbury, among other neighborhoods; and I have shared meals with leaders in East Boston and Jamaica Plain. In all of these settings, people have been enormously generous with their perspectives, opinions, suggestions, admonitions, and encouragements. This has left me inspired by the passion and commitment of so many for this region, challenged to ensure that Barr plays a constructive and respectful role as a good partner, and energized by the tremendous sense of possibility and aspiration.</p>

<p>Certain themes have emerged repeatedly: a shared sense of opportunity in Boston during a time of change; a keen interest in maximizing the multiple resources that Barr can bring to addressing the region’s challenges; and a hunger for more authentic collaboration and partnership with Barr and others to realize the opportunities before us. These themes certainly resonate for me and offer a preview of the broad directions we need to explore as we plan for the future. </p>

<p>In addition to these more positive themes I have greatly appreciated the candor of those who shared their challenges and frustrations with foundations including Barr. I know such sentiments are not limited to my recent conversations but are part of a broader dialogue about how organized philanthropy has been evolving. Much has been written recently (including by me in this <a href=""http://philanthropy.com/article/As-the-Role-of-Foundations/147613"">recent piece</a> for <em>The Chronicle of Philanthropy</em>) about what the shift to “strategic philanthropy” has meant for the nonprofits that raise funds from foundations. </p>

<p>In some quarters, nonprofit leaders describe feeling treated like “contractors” hired to advance a foundation’s agenda rather than being supported to fulfill their own mission. In other cases there is a disconnect between what foundations are willing to invest in and what they seek by way of outcomes put succinctly by one leader I spoke with: “You give us two years of money and seek five years of outcomes.” This too is an important backdrop as Barr develops its plans for the future. </p>

<p>At the same time as I have been engaging externally ,I have been meeting with each of our program teams to take stock of our existing work across the Foundation. In my view, successful planning for the future should begin with a clear-eyed assessment of what has worked what has been less successful what we have learned in the process and what this all suggests about the competencies and skills we already possess and those we aspire to. Achieving clarity about these areas not only honors work done over many years but also offers a solid platform upon which to build new areas in the future. </p>

<p>Beyond these activities within our programs we are also starting to explore how to more fully leverage communications as a tool to extend Barr’s impact and complement our grantmaking. As we seek to use communications in more strategic ways we will continue to focus on drawing attention to the efforts of our partners and to highlighting the issues we support. This is not an exercise in institutional self-promotion. There will be more to report on this dimension of Barr’s work as we learn from others who have done this effectively and with the right tenor. The most effective philanthropy is a balancing act—between being proactive and reactive, focused and flexible, between science and art.</p>

<p>The list of dichotomies goes on. Since resources are finite and need is infinite, foundations must be clear about their goals and the outcomes they seek; at the same time, finding that sweet spot where clarity of purpose balances with adaptability of execution strikes me as crucial. Searching for that balance will remain a principal focus for me and the trustees as we continue to shape the future of the Barr Foundation. I look forward to sharing more in this space in the months ahead and to the continued opportunity to learn from many of you.</p>"
16,Empty seats? Don't (just) look to your marketing department.,"<p>At a recent gathering of Boston arts leaders, researcher Alan Brown challenged participants to consider a new way to understand and make progress on a persistent challenge: how to build demand and diversify audiences for the arts.</p>","<p>Last month I had the chance to join a group of Boston arts leaders including many Barr grantees for a workshop on building demand. Our guest speaker was Alan Brown of <a href=""http://wolfbrown.com/"">WolfBrown Associates</a>. How to build demand particularly for more diverse audiences is one of the topics that grantees currently supported by the <a href=""http://www.barrfoundation.org/strategies/arts-culture/"">Barr-Klarman capacity building initiative</a> identified as something they wanted to explore together. Given broad interest in the topic we extended the invitation to other Boston arts leaders as well. </p>

<p>There was great energy in the room and lively conversation. For me one of the most interesting and provocative ideas Brown raised was that there are two types of demand – what he called &quot;selective&quot; vs. &quot;primary&quot; demand. Increasing selective demand is about convincing someone already interested in your product to buy it from you instead of from one of your competitors. Increasing primary demand on the other hand is about creating demand where it didn&#39;t exist before. In a paper on this topic commissioned by the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation Brown described the distinction this way &quot;the marketing director&#39;s job is to harvest the lowest hanging fruit while the demand-builder&#39;s job is to plant new orchards.&quot; </p>

<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/25/small.png?1642115541 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/25/medium.png?1642115541 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/25/large.png?1642115541 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/25/x_large.png?1642115541 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""Selective vs. Primary Demand Definitions (Source: Alan Brown)"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/25/small.png?1642115541"" /> <div class=""FancyAttribution""> <p>Alan Brown</p> </div> </div> </div> </p>

<p>At our session Brown suggested that too often arts organizations try to solve a primary demand problem with selective demand tactics. In other words they try to fill empty seats and diversify audiences through more aggressive marketing efforts instead of through programming or other means with potential to generate new primary demand - like the New World Symphony&#39;s free <a href=""http://www.nws.edu/wallcasts.aspx"">&quot;WALLCAST&quot;</a> live concert series in Miami Beach. </p>

<p>Drawing on his research Alan Brown proposed ten key strategies for building demand including:</p>

<ol>
<li>Experimentation with setting</li>
<li>Experimentation with format</li>
<li>Accessing demand across genres and disciplines</li>
<li>Building demand through active participation and bridging modalities</li>
<li>Curating programs that incorporate crowdsourcing and co-creation</li>
<li>Demystification (educational interventions)</li>
<li>Communications strategies involving artists</li>
<li>Leveraging media to reach new audiences</li>
<li>Lowering barriers to producing new work</li>
<li>New approaches to curating</li>

14,A New Approach to Scaling High-Quality Pre-Kindergarten,"<p>Building on its highly successful pre-kindergarten program, Boston Public Schools (BPS) has teamed up with community-based early care and education centers providing preschool programs to share what has worked well and to test a new way to expand access to high-quality early education.</p>","<p>As I mentioned in <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/building-on-whats-working-in-early-education-in-boston"">a previous post</a>, BPS&#39;s pre-kindergarten program, also known as &quot;K1,&quot; is seeing some of the best performance results in the country. <a href=""http://bostonpublicschools.org/site/default.aspx?PageType=3&DomainID=4&ModuleInstanceID=14&ViewID=047E6BE3-6D87-4130-8424-D8E4E9ED6C2A&RenderLoc=0&FlexDataID=3439&PageID=1"">One recent study</a> found that students participating in the program were fifty-percent more likely to enter school ready for kindergarten than students who had not.</p>

<p>Understandably, these kinds of results are contributing to high demand among Boston families—far outstripping the 2,200 seats the District currently offers. To expand supply, BPS is continuing to increase the number of K1 seats in its schools. But space and budgetary constraints have limited the pace and scale of growth. Another issue is that the District&#39;s K1 program does not offer the full-day, full-year care that many working families need.</p>

<p>To address these concerns, BPS has developed a complementary approach to in-district K1 expansion called <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/partners/boston-k1ds"">Boston K1DS</a>. Through this three-year demonstration project, BPS is expanding its K1 program to fourteen private, community-based preschool classrooms—with a focus on Boston&#39;s &quot;Circle of Promise&quot; and East Boston, which has the city&#39;s highest concentration of English language learners. Through this partnership, community-based programs receive a mix of curriculum coaching and professional development from BPS, as well as funding to increase the salaries of the participating teachers.</p>

<p>Boston K1DS is funded by the Barr Foundation, Boston Public Schools, the <a href=""http://www.mass.edu/stem/initiatives/pipelinescale.asp"">@Scale</a> initiative, the <a href=""http://www.mass.gov/edu/government/departments-and-boards/department-of-early-education-and-care"">Massachusetts Department of Early Education and Care</a>&#39;s Birth to 3rd Grade Alignment Grant (part of the <a href=""http://www2.ed.gov/programs/racetothetop-earlylearningchallenge/index.html"">Race to the Top — Early Learning Challenge</a> fund), and, through <a href=""http://thrivein5boston.org"">Thrive in 5</a>, the <a href=""http://www.jbcoxtrust.org"">Jessie B. Cox Trust</a> and the <a href=""http://www.piercetrust.org"">Harold Whitworth Pierce Charitable Trust</a>.</p>

11,From the President – Fall 2014,"<p>For us at the Barr Foundation, this past summer has provided an opportunity to give greater definition to the values that guide Barr’s philanthropy.</p>","<p>Dear friends,</p>

<p>In philanthropy values matter. Philanthropy represents an active manifestation of the impulse to give back, and for anyone who engages in a philanthropic act—whether as an individual donor or part of a larger enterprise—the values that inform that act are paramount.</p>

<p>For us at the Barr Foundation, this past summer has provided an opportunity to give greater definition to the values that animate Barr’s philanthropy. At a time when we are reflecting carefully upon the work we have done to date, what we have learned from those efforts, and how those lessons might inform the ways in which Barr will evolve in the future, this explicit articulation of our values will be an essential guide. In our case, given the ability to benefit from the perspectives of our founding trustees, Barbara and Amos Hostetter, we have identified a set of values to guide the Barr Foundation not just today, but well into the future.</p>

<p>I am pleased to share the following statement of Barr&#39;s core values, approved at our September trustee meeting:</p>

<p><em>The Barr Foundation is guided by a set of core values, which emanate from our founders, articulate our beliefs about what constitutes effective philanthropy, and describe how we carry out our mission of service.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Strive for excellence:</strong> We aim for the highest standards of performance, integrity, and service, in all dimensions of our work.</li>
<li><strong>Invest in leaders:</strong> We support effective, visionary, and collaborative leaders, who motivate others, drive change, and produce results.</li>
<li><strong>Act with humility:</strong> We approach our activities with respect for our partners, recognizing the privilege inherent in philanthropic work.</li>
<li><strong>Demonstrate curiosity:</strong> We actively solicit new perspectives to inform our work, understanding that solutions reside with those we serve.</li>
<li><strong>Adopt a long-term perspective:</strong> We take an expansive view, considering the implications of today’s decisions for future generations.</li>
<li><strong>Embrace risk:</strong> We pursue ambitious goals, which requires comfort with the possibility of failure and a commitment to learning.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the months ahead, as we identify how Barr’s priorities will evolve these values will be at the center of those decisions.</p>

<p>At their best values are not simply statements that are adopted and filed away; rather, they are expressed daily in the work of the institution. Our aspiration for these values is that they not only inform what work we do, but also how we carry out our mission of service. In the end, and with your support, we must—and will—hold ourselves accountable to living out these values in our actions, our relationships, and our work.</p>"
10,Why Not Go for Gold in Boston?,"<p>Over the last year, Barr has sponsored a study group of Boston transportation, development, and community leaders to explore whether Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) could be viable here.</p>","<p>In rapidly-developing cities around the world, there has been a surprising entrant in the quest to transform public transportation. From Bogota, Colombia, to Johannesburg, South Africa, to Guangzhou, China, riders are going further, faster, and more frequently than ever before on something we thought we knew, but have never known quite like this – a bus.</p>

<p>More aptly described as a &quot;trackless train&quot; or &quot;train on wheels,&quot; Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) is increasingly being looked at as a faster, better, cheaper, and more flexible alternative to rail. In January, I wrote about a <a href=""http://www.barrfoundation.org/news/what-if-we-focus-on-moving-people-instead-of-cars/"">learning tour to Mexico City</a> to get a first-hand look at their amazing &quot;Metro-Bus&quot; system. That trip was coordinated by the <a href=""https://www.itdp.org/"">Institute for Transportation and Development Policy</a> (ITDP), which provides technical assistance to cities considering BRT. Given its depth of experience, ITDP also developed a <a href=""https://www.itdp.org/?s=standard"">BRT Standard</a>, identifying what constitutes Gold, Silver, and Bronze-rated BRT systems. Last month, we added Barr&#39;s name to the list of institutional endorsers of this new standard.</p>

<p>One of the challenges of BRT is that many transit systems use the BRT term to promote service that doesn&#39;t really qualify as true BRT. In fact, there is no Gold-rated system in all of the United States. The best BRT system in the country right now is the silver-rated <a href=""http://www.rtahealthline.com/healthline-what-is.asp"">Healthline</a> in Cleveland.</p>

<p>Over the last year, Barr has sponsored ITDP to work with a study group of Boston transportation, development, and community leaders to explore whether BRT could be viable here. It is a complex question. To fully answer it, the study group is now gathering input from throughout the city to inform ITDP&#39;s technical analysis. Later this year, they expect to put these pieces together into a recommendation to the Massachusetts Department of Transportation. Yet, here&#39;s the teaser: BRT looks promising; it looks like a net positive for Boston; and, it warrants serious consideration as Boston embarks on a long-term mobility visioning process next year.</p>

<p>And if we go for BRT, why shouldn&#39;t Boston go for gold? </p>

9,New Webinar Offers 101 on Political Advocacy for Nonprofits,"<p>While the tax codes make it clear nonprofits can’t endorse or oppose specific candidates for office, or specific legislation, it turns out there is quite a lot they can and should do to advance their issues.</p>","<p>For nonprofits, election season can be a hopeful one. It can mean opportunities to educate and engage candidates, and to help them become champions and leaders for their causes. Yet many nonprofits are unclear about what the rules of engagement are during elections or for engagement in policy debates. While the tax codes make it clear 501(c)(3) organizations cannot endorse or oppose specific candidates for office, or specific legislation, it turns out there is quite a lot they can and should do.</p>

<p>Under the banner of the “Create the Vote” campaign spearheaded by <a href=""http://www.mass-creative.org"">MASSCreative</a>, Boston’s arts and culture community did a tremendous job generating energy, excitement, and focus on the arts during the city’s 2013 mayoral elections. As a candidate, Mayor Marty Walsh pledged to create a cabinet-level chief of arts and culture—something the City hadn’t had in more than 20 years. After a national search, the City recently announced the appointment of Julie Burros, currently the director of cultural planning in Chicago, to this new leadership role. Boston is also on track to launch its first ever cultural planning process.</p>

<p>This is shaping up to be a great local story. But what are the opportunities statewide, during the current governor’s race and beyond? </p>

<p>To help arts nonprofits better answer that question, and to understand what is in- and out-of-bounds with respect to political advocacy, last month, MASSCreative and Barr hosted a Political Advocacy 101 webinar. Guest speakers included Isaiah Castilla, advocacy programs counsel at the <a href=""http://www.afj.org"">Alliance for Justice</a>; Kelly Bates, Esq., founding executive director of the <a href=""http://www.emerson.edu/about-emerson/offices-departments/diversity/elma-lewis-center"">Elma Lewis Center for Civic Engagement, Learning, and Research at Emerson College</a>; and Jerry Wedge, executive director of the <a href=""http://theumbrellaarts.org"">Umbrella Community Arts Center</a> in Concord.</p>

<p>More than 75 people joined the webinar, which was full of practical information and resources. For those who missed it, here’s the recording:</p>

8,Making Room for Artistic Risk-Taking and Innovation,"<p>How can arts organizations innovate while managing risk? Barr's senior program officer for Arts & Culture, San San Wong, reflects on an ""electrifying panel"" held earlier this fall at MIT's Media Lab—part of our Barr-Klarman Arts Capacity Building Initiative.</p>","<p>Earlier this fall, grantees of the <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/arts-creativity/barr-klarman-arts-capacity-building"">Barr-Klarman Arts Capacity Building Initiative</a> had an electrifying discussion on risk-taking and innovation at the <a href=""http://www.media.mit.edu/"">MIT Media Lab</a>. The event featured three audacious art leaders, assembled under the thesis that artistic innovation, risk-taking, failure, and renewal are critical components of a vibrant cultural ecology. To explore the driving question—how do we innovate while managing risk?—<a href=""https://artsemerson.org/Online/default.asp"">ArtsEmerson</a> Director of Artistic Programs David Dower led a panel featuring:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Marc Bamuthi Joseph, chief of program and pedagogy at <a href=""http://www.ybca.org/"">Yerba Buena Center for the Arts</a></li>
<li>Tod Machover, professor of music and media at MIT and director of MIT Media Lab&#39;s <a href=""http://opera.media.mit.edu/"">Opera of the Future</a> group</li>
<li>Diane Paulus, artistic director of the <a href=""http://americanrepertorytheater.org/"">American Repertory Theater</a> at Harvard University</li>
</ul>

<p>The panelists kicked off the conversation by tackling the issue of risk itself: how does it inform art? To hear Paulus tell it, &quot;We&#39;re in arts because we want to transcend our limitations.&quot; Fascinating personal stories—including Machover&#39;s early experimentations with the synthesizer while composing &quot;crazy&quot; music at Juilliard—immediately engaged the audience. I was particularly struck by the panelists&#39; proclivity for taking bold chances. Joseph, who recalled his background in youth education and activism, described this fixation as an impetus for change, leaving the audience with a lasting question: &quot;Are you leaving the world a better place?&quot;</p>

<p>Dower steered the discussion towards some of the panelists&#39; riskiest yet most celebrated artistic endeavors. Paulus led the exchange with an eye-opening account of staging her lauded Macbeth adaptation, <em>Sleep No More</em>, and acknowledged the understandable skepticism that preceded her ambitious vision: staging the play throughout multiple rooms in the old Lincoln Elementary School in Brookline, Massachusetts. Ultimately, Paulus argued, it was the Brookline community and its &quot;barn-raising mentality&quot; that helped the show producers settle upon a location, build an interested audience, and settle organizational concerns about the production.</p>

<p>&quot;Artists see before others do,&quot; Joseph chimed in, drawing upon his years of teaching youth poetry courses that prioritized creativity above strict rules of form. &quot;The challenge, for many of us, is to trust an artist before we can see their vision.&quot;</p>

<p>Arguably this ethos of trusting the artist is what the MIT Media Lab took to heart in 1991, when Machover got the green light to build the world&#39;s first computer-programmed &quot;Hypercello&quot; for Yo-Yo Ma. It was an unlikely marriage of classical instrument and emergent technology, and, as Machover put it, the empowering nature of MIT compelled him to remain a prolific and productive force within the university.</p>

<p>As the conversation came to a close, the room was full of a palpable sense of shared learning and purpose, both of which are integral to this partnership between Barr and the Klarman Family Foundation to support local arts organizations—including allowing their artists to take greater risks. &quot;Artists who cut through generate communities,&quot; Joseph remarked to an audience member who asked how organizations could diversify their audiences. &quot;The show is the midpoint, not the endpoint.&quot; </p>

7,Little Cities that Could (and Did) Show Leadership on Climate,<p>Learn about a Barr grantee that has been creating its own climate playbook.</p>,"<p>Two thirds of the world’s energy use and seventy percent of global carbon emissions come from cities. There is no way we can address climate change without them. Larger cities like Boston have demonstrated critical leadership. Yet, success depends on leadership from smaller cities too, where the opportunities and challenges are different than in larger cities. Even if the goals are the same—reducing energy use, catalyzing a shift to clean energy, creating local green jobs—smaller cities need their own playbook. In 2011, Barr made a grant to the <a href=""http://www.mapc.org"">Metropolitan Area Planning Council</a> (MAPC) to start creating one. MAPC is the regional planning agency serving the people who live and work in the 101 cities and towns of Metro Boston. The goal of MAPC’s grant was to coordinate and accelerate climate action in smaller cities in the Greater Boston region.</p>

<p>In just three years, MAPC worked with fifty-six communities on a range of projects, helping city governments bring together business and civic leaders and residents to optimize opportunities, and catalyze a commitment to rapid action. Again and again, smaller cities, once mobilized, have demonstrated a nimbleness of decision making and efficiency of action rarely seen in larger cities. Overall impacts of the program are featured in this infographic from MAPC:</p>

<p><div class=""Media -full -right""> <div class=""Media-imageWrapper""> <img srcset=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/14/small.jpg?1642115512 640w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/14/medium.jpg?1642115512 960w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/14/large.jpg?1642115512 1200w, https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/14/x_large.jpg?1642115512 1600w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1009px) 95vw, 960px"" class=""Media-image"" alt=""MAPC Clean Energy Infographic"" src=""https://barrfdn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/image/14/small.jpg?1642115512"" /> </div> </div></p>

<p>Some of the other highlights and lessons learned from these first three years include:</p>
<h4>Harnessing group buying power</h4>
<p>Some of the most exciting lessons are coming from collective action. By leveraging the powerful combination of cities ready to act with MAPC&#39;s ability to deliver, the technical expertise MAPC has succeeded in harnessing group purchasing power to make big moves a reality. Two shining examples are Sudbury and Arlington. Sudbury leveraged a joint procurement deal to install a 1.5MW solar array on a former landfill. Arlington converted to 100% LED streetlights, subsequently realizing a sixty-percent drop in energy use and more than $140,000-per-year savings from lower energy and maintenance cost. MAPC has been helping scores of additional communities across the state navigate the complicated process of making the LED conversions.</p>
<h4>Tapping into &quot;plug-and-play&quot; approaches</h4>
<p>MAPC is helping cities reach deep into communities without having to develop stand-alone city energy efficiency programs. Instead cities tap into existing &quot;plug-and-play&quot; programs in partnership with utilities and energy vendors. The City of Medford launched a residential efficiency effort campaign in partnership with National Grid. It hit all its goals, won residents big savings, and was awarded an additional $40,000 in funding. Melrose partnered with MAPC to execute a small-business outreach effort with National Grid, which saw a participation rate thirty percent greater than witnessed in communities without active city and community engagement.</p>
<h4>Crowdsourcing ideas from the network</h4>
<p>In addition to guidance on energy projects, MAPC facilitates an ongoing knowledge-sharing network of communities that support and learn from each other. Nowhere was the value of the network more evident than in Stoughton, which, prior to engaging with MAPC, was struggling to pass the Massachusetts Stretch Energy Code—an integral step on the way to Green Communities status. In June, ninety percent of participants at a town meeting voted to approve a solar overlay district and pass the Stretch Code. David Billo, chair of the Energy Committee, credits the turnaround to the community forums supported by MAPC and ideas picked up from the network. You can see this work in action in a new, four-minute video featuring examples from smaller cities in Metro Boston:</p>

6,Announcing the 2015 Barr Fellows,<p>We are thrilled to announce a new class of Barr Fellows.</p>,"<p>Following my arrival in May, one of the very first activities I instigated was to gather with small groups of alumni of the Barr Fellowship, to share meals together in neighborhoods throughout Boston. Through these wide-ranging and engaging conversations, I came to learn what an extraordinary group of leaders Barr had identified and supported, and what a powerful experience the Barr Fellowship had provided to them. I also understood the sense of community the Fellowship had created for these dedicated and effective leaders. And that&#39;s what excites me about our announcement today.</p>

<p>Four times since 2005, Barr has named a class of twelve fellows, making a long-term commitment to each of them and facilitating their connections with one other. In its first ten years, the Barr Fellowship has established a rich legacy of impact in Boston and beyond. For those unfamiliar with the Barr Fellowship, I invite you to <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/fellows"">read more about it</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/from-the-president-fall-2014"">my most recent President’s message</a>, I introduced Barr’s core values, including our commitment “to invest in effective, visionary, and collaborative leaders, who motivate others, drive change, and produce results.” In that context, we couldn&#39;t be more pleased to introduce the 2015 Class of Barr Fellows:</p>

We look forward to sharing more about that next year.</p>

<p>For now, please join me in congratulating an extraordinary group of leaders. We are excited to welcome them as Barr Fellows.</p>

<p><em>*Following this announcement, Chrystal Kornegay and Nam Pham were both appointed to leadership roles in the new administration of Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker.

2,From the President – December 2014,"<p>As 2014 draws to a close, three key decisions that will guide Barr into its next era.</p>","<p>It has been just over six months since I joined the Barr Foundation with a mandate to lead us in shaping the next stage of Barr’s philanthropic mission. I have committed these early months to listening and learning, at the same time as I have worked with Barr’s founding trustees to clarify values and set parameters to guide our planning for the future. In this context, and as 2014 draws to a close, I wanted to share three key decisions. </p>

<p>First, we have decided what issue areas Barr will focus on. I am pleased to report that we intend to continue and expand over time Barr’s current domestic program areas in Arts &amp; Culture, Climate, and Education—including through new investments to build these teams. While it is likely that aspects of each program will evolve as a result of our planning in 2015, what will not change is Barr’s commitment to these three core areas. This decision does not foreclose the possibility of new areas for engagement, but it is our starting point. </p>

<p>Second, we have determined where the Foundation will focus. The announcement of my appointment last year described how Barr might grow over time and seek to extend its impact nationally. Through deeper consideration of this question, we have determined that to advance Barr’s core issues, our most effective scale—at least initially—will be a regional one. While our commitment to Boston endures, we intend to take a broader view. We will share more in the year ahead as we give greater definition to this regional focus. Additionally, we will pursue targeted opportunities to engage nationally where there is close alignment with our emerging priorities.</p>

<p>Finally, clarity on these two questions led us to a third, related decision, which is that we will be concluding Barr’s Global grantmaking program by the end of 2015. What made this decision especially difficult is the valuable work that has been carried out by the partners we have been privileged to support since 2010, when Barr launched this pilot program. We take enormous pride in the thoughtful strategies developed by Barr’s team, the quality of execution by our partners in the field, and, most importantly, the positive results to improve quality of life and the natural environment for people in Haiti, India, and East Africa. Because of this good work, Barr went beyond an initial $15-million commitment to this effort, bringing total grant commitments to $35 million to date. We also actively engaged with peers to share what we have been learning—including a December 2013 publication from the global team, entitled <em><a href=""https://www.barrfoundation.org/reports/local-to-global"">From Local to Global</a></em>. As a stand-alone program, Barr Global has been effective. Yet, with a determination to bring greater focus and coherence to Barr’s priority issues and geography, we reached this conclusion.</p>

<p>As a result of this decision regarding our Global program, I want to share our plans to ensure a responsible and thoughtful conclusion to what will be a five-year commitment to a set of global priorities. Barr staff will work with our global grantees to understand the implications for them and the best next steps. To ensure our global partners are able to effectively complete projects initiated with Barr support, we intend to dedicate additional resources in 2015. Next year was already budgeted to be Barr Global’s biggest payout year to date, with many active projects requiring ongoing engagement to meet intended objectives. As a result, we are unlikely to consider requests from new partners during this transition period. We also plan to identify additional opportunities to share what we have learned during these five years. To carry out all of this work, and to facilitate a smooth transition we are grateful for the ongoing engagement of Barr’s Global team, who will remain with us well into 2016.</p>

<p>We will have more to report in the year ahead as our planning efforts continue, but for now, I wanted to share these important decisions about the broad shape of Barr’s work in the future, and especially the decision about our Global program, our plans for a responsible transition in 2015, and our deep respect for the work of Barr’s Global team and partners. </p>

<p>I remain committed to sharing openly the decisions we are making during our planning period. And, as always, I <a href=""mailto:feedback@barrfoundation.org?subject=From%20the%20President%20-%20December%202014"">welcome your questions or suggestions</a> and remain grateful for your interest in the Barr Foundation.</p>"
1,"Districts—An Ambitious, but Achievable Scale for Energy Transformation","<p>What will it take to catalyze and accelerate the kind of energy transformation required to increase reliability, enhance resilience, meet ambitious climate goals, and create economic development opportunities? And what role can foundations play? Key takeaways from a recent gathering of funders interested in urban sustainability sponsored by the Funders' Network for Smart Growth and Livable Communities.</p>","<p>As I wrote in <a href=""http://www.barrfoundation.org/blog/the-little-cities-that-could-and-did-show-leadership-on-climate-action"">my last post</a>, cities have a huge role to play in addressing climate change. Yet, the challenge cannot be met one green building, one bus line, or one solar array at a time. Rapid, city-wide change is also difficult. We need tangible examples of how ambitious, but achievable change can happen. One promising model is district-scale projects.</p>

<p>Ever since the early 1900s, our country has relied on the same old centralized, hub-and-spoke model of energy generation and distribution (i.e., huge power plants, and massive networks of transmission wires)—as illustrated in the diagram below from Gridling Global. With increased frequency and intensity of severe weather events, this approach leaves whole regions vulnerable to power outages. It also creates unnecessary barriers to &quot;smart&quot; solutions, which disrupt the old model with more flexible, resilient, and less carbon-intensive approaches at the building, block, &quot;district,&quot; or &quot;micro-grid&quot; scale.</p>

<p>Last month I had the pleasure of serving as local host for <a href=""http://www.fundersnetwork.org/"">The Funders&#39; Network for Smart Growth and Livable Communities</a> (TFN) GREEN working group, which is a collection of sustainability funders, like Barr, committed to sharing ideas and strategies in areas of common interest. TFN&#39;s GREEN working group is focused on the intersection of sustainable design strategies and the health and vitality of neighborhoods. I have learned so much from my colleagues in the network over the years and this gathering in Boston was no exception. I moderated the opening session, which focused on some of Boston&#39;s early efforts to implement district-level energy solutions. Here are some of the highlights: </p>

<p>Our first speaker was Brian Swett, chief of the <a href=""http://www.cityofboston.gov/eeos"">City of Boston&#39;s Environment, Energy, and Open Space office</a>. He urged the group to focus its energies on 2050, and on the eighty-percent emissions-reduction goal. The City sees district energy as a key part of how it reaches its aggressive goals. Toward that end, Swett noted that the City of Boston has been engaging with area utilities to explore opportunities to launch district energy and microgrid projects. A recent <a href=""http://microgridknowledge.com/boston-wants-build-microgrids-legal"">Harvard Law School study</a> debunked a commonly held misconception that a utility&#39;s consent is required for microgrids that run electric lines that cross public ways.</p>

<p>Next up was Travis Sheehan, Eco-districts Energy Fellow at the <a href=""http://www.bostonredevelopmentauthority.org"">Boston Redevelopment Authority</a> (BRA), the Boston agency responsible for planning and economic development. Travis pointed out that Boston&#39;s medical and higher education community already boasts several district-scale energy systems. His role has been to take the idea into other sectors and to expand on it, from their single-owner model to more complex systems with multiple energy consumers and generation sources. The value proposition of these alternate approaches is clear—including lower total cost of energy, lower emissions, and greater reliability when major weather events knock out central grids.</p>

<p>This calculus means that, for City officials, district-scale energy also holds promise for economic competitiveness, generating investment opportunities, and job creation. To explore where this idea could be most beneficial, the BRA recently commissioned a <a href=""http://www.bostonredevelopmentauthority.org/news-calendar/news-updates/2014/06/06/citywide-energy-study-rfp-issued-q-a-with-travis-s"">citywide energy study</a> to map the energy load of every building in Boston, and to predict new pockets of energy demand in the next fifty years. This study will be completed next spring. <a href=""http://sustainablecitiescollective.com/posts/published/user/434471"">Travis has informative blog posts</a> on the role of city government in promoting district energy.</p>

<p>Our third speaker was David Queeley, Eco-Innovation Fellow at the <a href=""http://www.csndc.com"">Codman Square Neighborhood Development Corporation</a>. David has been working on facilitating the creation of a new model for sustainable and equitable development in a Dorchester neighborhood—Talbot Norfolk Triangle (TNT)—covering thirteen blocks, forty-six acres with 1,500 residents. The community leaders and residents in TNT have an impressive community-revitalization vision that includes transforming vacant properties into parks; deep energy retrofits of existing buildings; new mixed-income, net-zero homes; and local energy generation—with a focus on solar that also includes investigating shared (i.e., not just on individual homes and buildings) solar, and on connecting residents to apprenticeships in solar installation, weatherization, and a local recycling cooperative called <a href=""http://www.cero.coop"">CERO</a>. Dave indicated that if TNT is able to get these initiatives going, the innovations can easily be replicated in other neighborhoods along the Fairmount rail corridor, where similar revitalization efforts are also underway.</p>

<p>The session underscored how working at the district scale allows for pilot testing of new strategies that can become tangible, scalable examples for others to replicate. I will provide updates on Boston&#39;s district-level energy efforts in future blog posts. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>I am also thankful for this and other productive exchanges with colleagues via Barr&#39;s engagement with TFN, which helps us live out one of <a href=""http://www.barrfoundation.org/about"">our core values</a>, namely, curiosity, actively soliciting new perspectives to inform our work. Making progress against climate change will certainly depend upon this type of ongoing collaboration and shared learning.</p>"
